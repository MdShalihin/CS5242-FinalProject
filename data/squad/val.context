Established bands made something of a comeback in the mid-1980s . After an 8-year separation , Deep Purple returned with the classic Machine Head line-up to produce Perfect Strangers ( 1984 ) , which reached number five in the UK , hit the top five in five other countries , and was a platinum-seller in the US . After somewhat slower sales of its fourth album , Fair Warning , Van Halen rebounded with the Top 3 album Diver Down in 1982 , then reached their commercial pinnacle with 1984 . It reached number two on the Billboard album chart and provided the track " Jump " , which reached number one on the singles chart and remained there for several weeks . Heart , after floundering during the first half of the decade , made a comeback with their eponymous ninth studio album which hit number one and contained four Top 10 singles including their first number one hit . The new medium of video channels was used with considerable success by bands formed in previous decades . Among the first were ZZ Top , who mixed hard blues rock with new wave music to produce a series of highly successful singles , beginning with " Gim me All Your Lovin ' " ( 1983 ) , which helped their albums Eliminator ( 1983 ) and Afterburner ( 1985 ) achieve diamond and multi-platinum status respectively . Others found renewed success in the singles charts with power ballads , including REO Speedwagon with " Keep on Loving You " ( 1980 ) and " Ca n't Fight This Feeling " ( 1984 ) , Journey with " Do n't Stop Believin ' " ( 1981 ) and " Open Arms " ( 1982 ) , Foreigner 's " I Want to Know What Love Is " , Scorpions ' " Still Loving You " ( both from 1984 ) , Heart ’ s " What About Love " ( 1985 ) and " These Dreams " ( 1986 ) , and Boston 's " Amanda " ( 1986 ) .
Luther is honoured on 18 February with a commemoration in the Lutheran Calendar of Saints and in the Episcopal ( United States ) Calendar of Saints . In the Church of England 's Calendar of Saints he is commemorated on 31 October .
Jethro Burns , best known as half of the comedy duo Homer and Jethro , was also the first important jazz mandolinist . Tiny Moore popularized the mandolin in Western swing music . He initially played an 8-string Gibson but switched after 1952 to a 5-string solidbody electric instrument built by Paul Bigsby . Modern players David Grisman , Sam Bush , and Mike Marshall , among others , have worked since the early 1970s to demonstrate the mandolin 's versatility for all styles of music . Chris Thile of California is a well-known player , and has accomplished many feats of traditional bluegrass , classical , contemporary pop and rock ; the band Nickel Creek featured his playing in its blend of traditional and pop styles , and he now plays in his band Punch Brothers . Most commonly associated with bluegrass , mandolin has been used a lot in country music over the years . Some well-known players include Marty Stuart , Vince Gill , and Ricky Skaggs .
In addition , there are $ 2 million worth of other ancillary events , including a week-long event at the Santa Clara Convention Center , a beer , wine and food festival at Bellomy Field at Santa Clara University , and a pep rally . A professional fundraiser will aid in finding business sponsors and individual donors , but still may need the city council to help fund the event . Additional funding will be provided by the city council , which has announced plans to set aside seed funding for the event .
Book 1 ( at the head of the Odyssean section ) opens with a storm which Juno , Aeneas ' enemy throughout the poem , stirs up against the fleet . The storm drives the hero to the coast of Carthage , which historically was Rome 's deadliest foe . The queen , Dido , welcomes the ancestor of the Romans , and under the influence of the gods falls deeply in love with him . At a banquet in Book 2 , Aeneas tells the story of the sack of Troy , the death of his wife , and his escape , to the enthralled Carthaginians , while in Book 3 he recounts to them his wanderings over the Mediterranean in search of a suitable new home . Jupiter in Book 4 recalls the lingering Aeneas to his duty to found a new city , and he slips away from Carthage , leaving Dido to commit suicide , cursing Aeneas and calling down revenge in a symbolic anticipation of the fierce wars between Carthage and Rome . In Book 5 , Aeneas ' father Anchises dies and funeral games are celebrated for him . On reaching Cumae , in Italy in Book 6 , Aeneas consults the Cumaean Sibyl , who conducts him through the Underworld where Aeneas meets the dead Anchises who reveals Rome 's destiny to his son .
Luther refused to recant his writings . He is sometimes also quoted as saying : " Here I stand . I can do no other " . Recent scholars consider the evidence for these words to be unreliable , since they were inserted before " May God help me " only in later versions of the speech and not recorded in witness accounts of the proceedings . However , Mullett suggests that given his nature , " we are free to believe that Luther would tend to select the more dramatic form of words . "
Jethro Burns , best known as half of the comedy duo Homer and Jethro , was also the first important jazz mandolinist . Tiny Moore popularized the mandolin in Western swing music .

There are seven suburbicarian sees : Ostia , Albano , Porto and Santa Rufina , Palestrina , Sabina and Mentana , Frascati and Velletri . Velletri was united with Ostia from 1150 until 1914 , when Pope Pius X separated them again , but decreed that whatever cardinal bishop became Dean of the College of Cardinals would keep the suburbicarian see he already held , adding to it that of Ostia , with the result that there continued to be only six cardinal bishops .
The flagship stations of each station in the markets of each team will carry their local play-by-play calls . In Denver , KOA ( 850 AM ) and KRFX ( 103.5 FM ) will carry the game , with Dave Logan on play-by-play and Ed McCaffrey on color commentary . In North Carolina , WBT ( 1110 AM ) will carry the game , with Mick Mixon on play-by-play and Eugene Robinson and Jim Szoke on color commentary . WBT will also simulcast the game on its sister station WBT-FM ( 99.3 FM ) , which is based in Chester , South Carolina . As KOA and WBT are both clear-channel stations , the local broadcasts will be audible over much of the western United States after sunset ( for Denver ) and the eastern United States throughout the game ( for Carolina ) . In accordance with contractual rules , the rest of the stations in the Broncos and Panthers radio networks will either carry the Westwood One feed or not carry the game at all .
Luther taught that salvation and subsequently eternal life is not earned by good deeds but is received only as a free gift of God 's grace through faith in Jesus Christ as redeemer from sin . His theology challenged the authority and office of the Pope by teaching that the Bible is the only source of divinely revealed knowledge from God and opposed sacerdotalism by considering all baptized Christians to be a holy priesthood . Those who identify with these , and all of Luther 's wider teachings , are called Lutherans even though Luther insisted on Christian or Evangelical as the only acceptable names for individuals who professed Christ .
It seems to have been St Bernard of Clairvaux who , in the 12th century , explicitly raised the question of the Immaculate Conception . A feast of the Conception of the Blessed Virgin had already begun to be celebrated in some churches of the West . St Bernard blames the canons of the metropolitan church of Lyon for instituting such a festival without the permission of the Holy See . In doing so , he takes occasion to repudiate altogether the view that the conception of Mary was sinless . It is doubtful , however , whether he was using the term " conception " in the same sense in which it is used in the definition of Pope Pius IX . Bernard would seem to have been speaking of conception in the active sense of the mother 's cooperation , for in his argument he says : " How can there be absence of sin where there is concupiscence ( libido ) ? " and stronger expressions follow , showing that he is speaking of the mother and not of the child .
Manning finished the year with a career-low 67.9 passer rating , throwing for 2,249 yards and nine touchdowns , with 17 interceptions . In contrast , Osweiler threw for 1,967 yards , 10 touchdowns and six interceptions for a rating of 86.4 . Veteran receiver Demaryius Thomas led the team with 105 receptions for 1,304 yards and six touchdowns , while Emmanuel Sanders caught 76 passes for 1,135 yards and six scores , while adding another 106 yards returning punts . Tight end Owen Daniels was also a big element of the passing game with 46 receptions for 517 yards . Running back C. J. Anderson was the team 's leading rusher 863 yards and seven touchdowns , while also catching 25 passes for 183 yards . Running back Ronnie Hillman also made a big impact with 720 yards , five touchdowns , 24 receptions , and a 4.7 yards per carry average . Overall , the offense ranked 19th in scoring with 355 points and did not have any Pro Bowl selections .
John Locke in particular exemplified this new age of political theory with his work Two Treatises of Government . In it Locke proposes a state of nature theory that directly complements his conception of how political development occurs and how it can be founded through contractual obligation . Locke stood to refute Sir Robert Filmer 's paternally founded political theory in favor of a natural system based on nature in a particular given system . The theory of the divine right of kings became a passing fancy , exposed to the type of ridicule with which John Locke treated it . Unlike Machiavelli and Hobbes but like Aquinas , Locke would accept Aristotle 's dictum that man seeks to be happy in a state of social harmony as a social animal . Unlike Aquinas 's preponderant view on the salvation of the soul from original sin , Locke believes man 's mind comes into this world as tabula rasa . For Locke , knowledge is neither innate , revealed nor based on authority but subject to uncertainty tempered by reason , tolerance and moderation . According to Locke , an absolute ruler as proposed by Hobbes is unnecessary , for natural law is based on reason and seeking peace and survival for man .
Instruments were marketed by teacher-dealers , much as the title character in the popular musical The Music Man . Often , these teacher-dealers conducted mandolin orchestras : groups of 4-50 musicians who played various mandolin family instruments . However , alongside the teacher-dealers were serious musicians , working to create a spot for the instrument in classical music , ragtime and jazz . Like the teacher-dealers , they traveled the U.S. , recording records , giving performances and teaching individuals and mandolin orchestras . Samuel Siegel played mandolin in Vaudeville and became one of America 's preeminent mandolinists . Seth Weeks was an African American who not only taught and performed in the United States , but also in Europe , where he recorded records . Another pioneering African American musician and director who made his start with a mandolin orchestra was composer James Reese Europe . W. Eugene Page toured the country with a group , and was well known for his mandolin and mandola performances . Other names include Valentine Abt , Samuel Adelstein , William Place , Jr. , and Aubrey Stauffer .
Despite the disagreements on the Eucharist , the Marburg Colloquy paved the way for the signing in 1530 of the Augsburg Confession , and for the formation of the Schmalkaldic League the following year by leading Protestant nobles such as John of Saxony , Philip of Hesse , and George , Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach . The Swiss cities , however , did not sign these agreements .
Zinc is a bluish-white , lustrous , diamagnetic metal , though most common commercial grades of the metal have a dull finish . It is somewhat less dense than iron and has a hexagonal crystal structure , with a distorted form of hexagonal close packing , in which each atom has six nearest neighbors ( at 265.9 pm ) in its own plane and six others at a greater distance of 290.6 pm . The metal is hard and brittle at most temperatures but becomes malleable between 100 and 150 °C . Above 210 °C , the metal becomes brittle again and can be pulverized by beating . Zinc is a fair conductor of electricity . For a metal , zinc has relatively low melting ( 419.5 °C ) and boiling points ( 907 °C ) . Its melting point is the lowest of all the transition metals aside from mercury and cadmium .
The effect of Luther 's intervention was immediate . After the sixth sermon , the Wittenberg jurist Jerome Schurf wrote to the elector : " Oh , what joy has Dr. Martin 's return spread among us ! His words , through divine mercy , are bringing back every day misguided people into the way of the truth . "
After each team punted , Panthers quarterback Cam Newton appeared to complete a 24-yard pass Jerricho Cotchery , but the call was ruled an incompletion and upheld after a replay challenge . CBS analyst and retired referee Mike Carey stated he disagreed with the call and felt the review clearly showed the pass was complete . A few plays later , on 3rd-and-10 from the 15-yard line , linebacker Von Miller knocked the ball out of Newton 's hands while sacking him , and Malik Jackson recovered it in the end zone for a Broncos touchdown , giving the team a 10–0 lead . This was the first fumble return touchdown in a Super Bowl since Super Bowl XXVIII at the end of the 1993 season .
Zinc is a chemical element with symbol Zn and atomic number 30 . It is the first element of group 12 of the periodic table . In some respects zinc is chemically similar to magnesium : its ion is of similar size and its only common oxidation state is +2 . Zinc is the 24th most abundant element in Earth 's crust and has five stable isotopes . The most common zinc ore is sphalerite ( zinc blende ) , a zinc sulfide mineral . The largest mineable amounts are found in Australia , Asia , and the United States . Zinc production includes froth flotation of the ore , roasting , and final extraction using electricity ( electrowinning ) .
William Champion 's brother , John , patented a process in 1758 for calcining zinc sulfide into an oxide usable in the retort process . Prior to this , only calamine could be used to produce zinc . In 1798 , Johann Christian Ruberg improved on the smelting process by building the first horizontal retort smelter . Jean-Jacques Daniel Dony built a different kind of horizontal zinc smelter in Belgium , which processed even more zinc . Italian doctor Luigi Galvani discovered in 1780 that connecting the spinal cord of a freshly dissected frog to an iron rail attached by a brass hook caused the frog 's leg to twitch . He incorrectly thought he had discovered an ability of nerves and muscles to create electricity and called the effect " animal electricity " . The galvanic cell and the process of galvanization were both named for Luigi Galvani and these discoveries paved the way for electrical batteries , galvanization and cathodic protection .
Following their loss in the divisional round of the previous season 's playoffs , the Denver Broncos underwent numerous coaching changes , including a mutual parting with head coach John Fox ( who had won four divisional championships in his four years as Broncos head coach ) , and the hiring of Gary Kubiak as the new head coach . Under Kubiak , the Broncos planned to install a run-oriented offense with zone blocking to blend in with quarterback Peyton Manning 's shotgun passing skills , but struggled with numerous changes and injuries to the offensive line , as well as Manning having his worst statistical season since his rookie year with the Indianapolis Colts in 1998 , due to a plantar fasciitis injury in his heel that he had suffered since the summer , and the simple fact that Manning was getting old , as he turned 39 in the 2015 off-season . Although the team had a 7–0 start , Manning led the NFL in interceptions . In week 10 , Manning suffered a partial tear of the plantar fasciitis in his left foot . He set the NFL 's all-time record for career passing yards in this game , but was benched after throwing four interceptions in favor of backup quarterback Brock Osweiler , who took over as the starter for most of the remainder of the regular season . Osweiler was injured , however , leading to Manning 's return during the Week 17 regular season finale , where the Broncos were losing 13–7 against the 4–11 San Diego Chargers , resulting in Manning re-claiming the starting quarterback position for the playoffs by leading the team to a key 27–20 win that enabled the team to clinch the number one overall AFC seed . Under defensive coordinator Wade Phillips , the Broncos ' defense ranked number one in total yards allowed , passing yards allowed and sacks , and like the previous three seasons , the team has continued to set numerous individual , league and franchise records . With the defense carrying the team despite the issues with the offense , the Broncos finished the regular season with a 12–4 record and earned home-field advantage throughout the AFC playoffs .

Lewinter previously served as chairman and CEO of Universal Motown Republic Group . In January 2012 , Dennis Kooker was named President of Global Digital Business and US Sales .
Luther was the most widely read author of his generation , and within Germany he acquired the status of a prophet . According to the prevailing view among historians , his anti-Jewish rhetoric contributed significantly to the development of antisemitism in Germany , and in the 1930s and 1940s provided an " ideal underpinning " for the Nazis ' attacks on Jews . Reinhold Lewin writes that anybody who " wrote against the Jews for whatever reason believed he had the right to justify himself by triumphantly referring to Luther . " According to Michael , just about every anti-Jewish book printed in the Third Reich contained references to and quotations from Luther . Heinrich Himmler wrote admiringly of his writings and sermons on the Jews in 1940 . The city of Nuremberg presented a first edition of On the Jews and their Lies to Julius Streicher , editor of the Nazi newspaper Der Stürmer , on his birthday in 1937 ; the newspaper described it as the most radically anti-Semitic tract ever published . It was publicly exhibited in a glass case at the Nuremberg rallies and quoted in a 54-page explanation of the Aryan Law by Dr. E.H. Schulz and Dr. R. Frercks .
The bandolim ( Portuguese for " mandolin " ) was a favourite instrument within the Portuguese bourgeoisie of the 19th century , but its rapid spread took it to other places , joining other instruments . Today you can see mandolins as part of the traditional and folk culture of Portuguese singing groups and the majority of the mandolin scene in Portugal is in Madeira Island . Madeira has over 17 active mandolin Orchestras and Tunas . The mandolin virtuoso Fabio Machado is one of Portugal 's most accomplished mandolin players . The Portuguese influence brought the mandolin to Brazil .
The Georgics ' tone wavers between optimism and pessimism , sparking critical debate on the poet 's intentions , but the work lays the foundations for later didactic poetry . Virgil and Maecenas are said to have taken turns reading the Georgics to Octavian upon his return from defeating Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC .
On 17 December 1941 , seven Protestant regional church confederations issued a statement agreeing with the policy of forcing Jews to wear the yellow badge , " since after his bitter experience Luther had already suggested preventive measures against the Jews and their expulsion from German territory . " According to Daniel Goldhagen , Bishop Martin Sasse , a leading Protestant churchman , published a compendium of Luther 's writings shortly after Kristallnacht , for which Diarmaid MacCulloch , Professor of the History of the Church in the University of Oxford argued that Luther 's writing was a " blueprint . " Sasse applauded the burning of the synagogues and the coincidence of the day , writing in the introduction , " On 10 November 1938 , on Luther 's birthday , the synagogues are burning in Germany . " The German people , he urged , ought to heed these words " of the greatest antisemite of his time , the warner of his people against the Jews . "
On 8 February 2007 , BSkyB announced its intention to replace its three free-to-air digital terrestrial channels with four subscription channels . It was proposed that these channels would offer a range of content from the BSkyB portfolio including sport ( including English Premier League Football ) , films , entertainment and news . The announcement came a day after Setanta Sports confirmed that it would launch in March as a subscription service on the digital terrestrial platform , and on the same day that NTL 's services re-branded as Virgin Media . However , industry sources believe BSkyB will be forced to shelve plans to withdraw its channels from Freeview and replace them with subscription channels , due to possible lost advertising revenue .
In addition to the Vince Lombardi Trophy that all Super Bowl champions receive , the winner of Super Bowl 50 will also receive a large , 18-karat gold-plated " 50 " .

In July 2013 , the English High Court of Justice found that Microsoft ’ s use of the term " SkyDrive " infringed on Sky ’ s right to the " Sky " trademark . On 31 July 2013 , BSkyB and Microsoft announced their settlement , in which Microsoft will not appeal the ruling , and will rename its SkyDrive cloud storage service after an unspecified " reasonable period of time to allow for an orderly transition to a new brand , " plus " financial and other terms , the details of which are confidential " . On 27 January 2014 , Microsoft announced " that SkyDrive will soon become OneDrive " and " SkyDrive Pro " becomes " OneDrive for Business " .
Gender identity forms an important part of identity in psychology , as it dictates to a significant degree how one views oneself both as a person and in relation to other people , ideas and nature . Other aspects of identity , such as racial , religious , ethnic , occupational… etc . may also be more or less significant – or significant in some situations but not in others ( Weinreich & Saunderson 2003 pp26–34 ) . In cognitive psychology , the term " identity " refers to the capacity for self-reflection and the awareness of self . ( Leary & Tangney 2003 , p. 3 )
The defined dogma of the Immaculate Conception regards original sin only , saying that Mary was preserved from any stain ( in Latin , macula or labes , the second of these two synonymous words being the one used in the formal definition ) . The proclaimed Roman Catholic dogma states " that the most Blessed Virgin Mary , in the first instance of her conception , by a singular grace and privilege granted by Almighty God , in view of the merits of Jesus Christ , the Saviour of the human race , was preserved free from all stain of original sin . " Therefore , being always free from original sin , the doctrine teaches that from her conception Mary received the sanctifying grace that would normally come with baptism after birth .
Weinreich 's identity variant similarly includes the categories of identity diffusion , foreclosure and crisis , but with a somewhat different emphasis . Here , with respect to identity diffusion for example , an optimal level is interpreted as the norm , as it is unrealistic to expect an individual to resolve all their conflicted identifications with others ; therefore we should be alert to individuals with levels which are much higher or lower than the norm – highly diffused individuals are classified as diffused , and those with low levels as foreclosed or defensive . ( Weinreich & Saunderson , 2003 , pp 65–67 ; 105-106 ) . Weinreich applies the identity variant in a framework which also allows for the transition from one to another by way of biographical experiences and resolution of conflicted identifications situated in various contexts – for example , an adolescent going through family break-up may be in one state , whereas later in a stable marriage with a secure professional role may be in another . Hence , though there is continuity , there is also development and change . ( Weinreich & Saunderson , 2003 , pp 22–23 ) .
Luther wrote about the Jews throughout his career , though only a few of his works dealt with them directly . Luther rarely encountered Jews during his life , but his attitudes reflected a theological and cultural tradition which saw Jews as a rejected people guilty of the murder of Christ , and he lived within a local community that had expelled Jews some ninety years earlier . He considered the Jews blasphemers and liars because they rejected the divinity of Jesus , whereas Christians believed Jesus was the Messiah . But Luther believed that all human beings who set themselves against God were equally guilty . As early as 1516 , he wrote that many people " are proud with marvelous stupidity when they call the Jews dogs , evildoers , or whatever they like , while they too , and equally , do not realize who or what they are in the sight of God " . In 1523 , Luther advised kindness toward the Jews in That Jesus Christ was Born a Jew and also aimed to convert them to Christianity . When his efforts at conversion failed , he grew increasingly bitter toward them . In his 2010 book Bonhoeffer : Pastor , Martyr , Prophet , Spy , Christian author Eric Metaxas claimed that Luther 's attitude towards Jews " unraveled along with his health . "

On December 28 , 2015 , ESPN Deportes announced that they had reached an agreement with CBS and the NFL to be the exclusive Spanish-language broadcaster of the game , marking the third dedicated Spanish-language broadcast of the Super Bowl . Unlike NBC and Fox , CBS does not have a Spanish-language outlet of its own that could broadcast the game ( though per league policy , a separate Spanish play-by-play call was carried on CBS 's second audio program channel for over-the-air viewers ) . The game was called by ESPN Deportes ' Monday Night Football commentary crew of Alvaro Martin and Raul Allegre , and sideline reporter John Sutcliffe . ESPN Deportes broadcast pre-game and post-game coverage , while Martin , Allegre , and Sutcliffe contributed English-language reports for ESPN 's SportsCenter and Mike & Mike .

Published at a time of rising demand for German-language publications , Luther 's version quickly became a popular and influential Bible translation . As such , it made a significant contribution to the evolution of the German language and literature . Furnished with notes and prefaces by Luther , and with woodcuts by Lucas Cranach that contained anti-papal imagery , it played a major role in the spread of Luther 's doctrine throughout Germany . The Luther Bible influenced other vernacular translations , such as William Tyndale 's English Bible ( 1525 forward ) , a precursor of the King James Bible .
The Panthers used the San Jose State practice facility and stayed at the San Jose Marriott . The Broncos practiced at Stanford University and stayed at the Santa Clara Marriott .

Westwood One will carry the game throughout North America , with Kevin Harlan as play-by-play announcer , Boomer Esiason and Dan Fouts as color analysts , and James Lofton and Mark Malone as sideline reporters . Jim Gray will anchor the pre-game and halftime coverage .
Like any plucked instrument , mandolin notes decay to silence rather than sound out continuously as with a bowed note on a violin , and mandolin notes decay faster than larger stringed instruments like the guitar . This encourages the use of tremolo ( rapid picking of one or more pairs of strings ) to create sustained notes or chords . The mandolin 's paired strings facilitate this technique : the plectrum ( pick ) strikes each of a pair of strings alternately , providing a more full and continuous sound than a single string would .
Egypt also hosts an unknown number of refugees and asylum seekers , estimated to be between 500,000 and 3 million . There are some 70,000 Palestinian refugees , and about 150,000 recently arrived Iraqi refugees , but the number of the largest group , the Sudanese , is contested . [ nb 1 ] The once-vibrant and ancient Greek and Jewish communities in Egypt have almost disappeared , with only a small number remaining in the country , but many Egyptian Jews visit on religious or other occasions and tourism . Several important Jewish archaeological and historical sites are found in Cairo , Alexandria and other cities .
The official policy became one of biological and cultural assimilation : " Eliminate the full-blood and permit the white admixture to half-castes and eventually the race will become white " . This led to different treatment for " black " and " half-caste " individuals , with lighter-skinned individuals targeted for removal from their families to be raised as " white " people , restricted from speaking their native language and practising traditional customs , a process now known as the Stolen Generation .
From 1510 to 1520 , Luther lectured on the Psalms , the books of Hebrews , Romans , and Galatians . As he studied these portions of the Bible , he came to view the use of terms such as penance and righteousness by the Catholic Church in new ways . He became convinced that the church was corrupt in its ways and had lost sight of what he saw as several of the central truths of Christianity . The most important for Luther was the doctrine of justification – God 's act of declaring a sinner righteous – by faith alone through God 's grace . He began to teach that salvation or redemption is a gift of God 's grace , attainable only through faith in Jesus as the Messiah . " This one and firm rock , which we call the doctrine of justification , " he wrote , " is the chief article of the whole Christian doctrine , which comprehends the understanding of all godliness . "
The Panthers defense gave up just 308 points , ranking sixth in the league , while also leading the NFL in interceptions with 24 and boasting four Pro Bowl selections . Pro Bowl defensive tackle Kawann Short led the team in sacks with 11 , while also forcing three fumbles and recovering two . Fellow lineman Mario Addison added 6½ sacks . The Panthers line also featured veteran defensive end Jared Allen , a 5-time pro bowler who was the NFL 's active career sack leader with 136 , along with defensive end Kony Ealy , who had 5 sacks in just 9 starts . Behind them , two of the Panthers three starting linebackers were also selected to play in the Pro Bowl : Thomas Davis and Luke Kuechly . Davis compiled 5½ sacks , four forced fumbles , and four interceptions , while Kuechly led the team in tackles ( 118 ) forced two fumbles , and intercepted four passes of his own . Carolina 's secondary featured Pro Bowl safety Kurt Coleman , who led the team with a career high seven interceptions , while also racking up 88 tackles and Pro Bowl cornerback Josh Norman , who developed into a shutdown corner during the season and had four interceptions , two of which were returned for touchdowns .
BSkyB initially charged additional subscription fees for using a Sky+ PVR with their service ; waiving the charge for subscribers whose package included two or more premium channels . This changed as from 1 July 2007 , and now customers that have Sky+ and subscribe to any BSkyB subscription package get Sky+ included at no extra charge . Customers that do not subscribe to BSkyB 's channels can still pay a monthly fee to enable Sky+ functions . In January 2010 BSkyB discontinued the Sky+ Box , limited the standard Sky Box to Multiroom upgrade only and started to issue the Sky+HD Box as standard , thus giving all new subscribers the functions of Sky+ . In February 2011 BSkyB discontinued the non-HD variant of its Multiroom box , offering a smaller version of the SkyHD box without Sky+ functionality . In September 2007 , Sky launched a new TV advertising campaign targeting Sky+ at women . As of 31 March 2008 , Sky had 3,393,000 Sky+ users .
Pennies and other small coins are sometimes ingested by dogs , resulting in the need for medical treatment to remove the foreign body . The zinc content of some coins can cause zinc toxicity , which is commonly fatal in dogs , where it causes a severe hemolytic anemia , and also liver or kidney damage ; vomiting and diarrhea are possible symptoms . Zinc is highly toxic in parrots and poisoning can often be fatal . The consumption of fruit juices stored in galvanized cans has resulted in mass parrot poisonings with zinc .
Luther sympathised with some of the peasants ' grievances , as he showed in his response to the Twelve Articles in May 1525 , but he reminded the aggrieved to obey the temporal authorities . During a tour of Thuringia , he became enraged at the widespread burning of convents , monasteries , bishops ' palaces , and libraries . In Against the Murderous , Thieving Hordes of Peasants , written on his return to Wittenberg , he gave his interpretation of the Gospel teaching on wealth , condemned the violence as the devil 's work , and called for the nobles to put down the rebels like mad dogs :
Although Egypt was a majority Christian country before the 7th Century , after Islam arrived , the country was slowly Islamified to become a majority Muslim country . Egypt emerged as a centre of politics and culture in the Muslim world . Under Anwar Sadat , Islam became the official state religion and Sharia the main source of law . It is estimated that 15 million Egyptians follow Native Sufi orders , with the Sufi leadership asserting that the numbers are much greater as many Egyptian Sufis are not officially registered with a Sufi order .
On June 4 , 2014 , the NFL announced that the practice of branding Super Bowl games with Roman numerals , a practice established at Super Bowl V , would be temporarily suspended , and that the game would be named using Arabic numerals as Super Bowl 50 as opposed to Super Bowl L. The use of Roman numerals will be reinstated for Super Bowl LI . Jaime Weston , the league 's vice president of brand and creative , explained that a primary reason for the change was the difficulty of designing an aesthetically pleasing logo with the letter " L " using the standardized logo template introduced at Super Bowl XLV . The logo also deviates from the template by featuring large numerals , colored in gold , behind the Vince Lombardi Trophy , instead of underneath and in silver as in the standard logo .
Beginning several centuries ago , during the period of the Ottoman Empire , tens of thousands of Black Africans were brought by slave traders to plantations and agricultural areas situated between Antalya and Istanbul in present-day Turkey . Some of their descendants remained in situ , and many migrated to larger cities and towns . Other blacks slaves were transported to Crete , from where they or their descendants later reached the İzmir area through the population exchange between Greece and Turkey in 1923 , or indirectly from Ayvalık in pursuit of work .
With Rivera having been a linebacker with the Chicago Bears in Super Bowl XX , and Kubiak replacing Elway at the end of the Broncos ' defeats in Super Bowls XXI and XXIV , this will be the first Super Bowl in which both head coaches played in the game themselves .

The bandolim ( Portuguese for " mandolin " ) was a favourite instrument within the Portuguese bourgeoisie of the 19th century , but its rapid spread took it to other places , joining other instruments . Today you can see mandolins as part of the traditional and folk culture of Portuguese singing groups and the majority of the mandolin scene in Portugal is in Madeira Island . Madeira has over 17 active mandolin Orchestras and Tunas . The mandolin virtuoso Fabio Machado is one of Portugal 's most accomplished mandolin players . The Portuguese influence brought the mandolin to Brazil .
The opening years of the 1980s saw a number of changes in personnel and direction of established hard rock acts , including the deaths of Bon Scott , the lead singer of AC/DC , and John Bonham , drummer with Led Zeppelin . Whereas Zeppelin broke up almost immediately afterwards , AC/DC pressed on , recording the album Back in Black ( 1980 ) with their new lead singer , Brian Johnson . It became the fifth-highest-selling album of all time in the US and the second-highest-selling album in the world . Black Sabbath had split with original singer Ozzy Osbourne in 1979 and replaced him with Ronnie James Dio , formerly of Rainbow , giving the band a new sound and a period of creativity and popularity beginning with Heaven and Hell ( 1980 ) . Osbourne embarked on a solo career with Blizzard of Ozz ( 1980 ) , featuring American guitarist Randy Rhoads . Some bands , such as Queen , moved away from their hard rock roots and more towards pop rock , while others , including Rush with Moving Pictures ( 1981 ) , began to return to a hard rock sound . The creation of thrash metal , which mixed heavy metal with elements of hardcore punk from about 1982 , particularly by Metallica , Anthrax , Megadeth and Slayer , helped to create extreme metal and further remove the style from hard rock , although a number of these bands or their members would continue to record some songs closer to a hard rock sound . Kiss moved away from their hard rock roots toward pop metal : firstly removing their makeup in 1983 for their Lick It Up album , and then adopting the visual and sound of glam metal for their 1984 release , Animalize , both of which marked a return to commercial success . Pat Benatar was one of the first women to achieve commercial success in hard rock , with three successive Top 5 albums between 1980 and 1982 .
In October 1529 , Philip I , Landgrave of Hesse , convoked an assembly of German and Swiss theologians at the Marburg Colloquy , to establish doctrinal unity in the emerging Protestant states . Agreement was achieved on fourteen points out of fifteen , the exception being the nature of the Eucharist – the sacrament of the Lord 's Supper—an issue crucial to Luther .
Egyptian music is a rich mixture of indigenous , Mediterranean , African and Western elements . It has been an integral part of Egyptian culture since antiquity . The ancient Egyptians credited one of their gods Hathor with the invention of music , which Osiris in turn used as part of his effort to civilise the world . Egyptians used music instruments since then . Contemporary Egyptian music traces its beginnings to the creative work of people such as Abdu El Hamouli , Almaz and Mahmoud Osman , who influenced the later work of Sayed Darwish , Umm Kulthum , Mohammed Abdel Wahab and Abdel Halim Hafez whose age is considered the golden age of music in Egypt and the whole Middle East and North-Africa . Prominent contemporary Egyptian pop singers include Amr Diab and Mohamed Mounir .
Luther 's translation used the variant of German spoken at the Saxon chancellery , intelligible to both northern and southern Germans . He intended his vigorous , direct language to make the Bible accessible to everyday Germans , " for we are removing impediments and difficulties so that other people may read it without hindrance . "
By about 6000 BC , a Neolithic culture rooted in the Nile Valley . During the Neolithic era , several predynastic cultures developed independently in Upper and Lower Egypt . The Badarian culture and the successor Naqada series are generally regarded as precursors to dynastic Egypt . The earliest known Lower Egyptian site , Merimda , predates the Badarian by about seven hundred years . Contemporaneous Lower Egyptian communities coexisted with their southern counterparts for more than two thousand years , remaining culturally distinct , but maintaining frequent contact through trade . The earliest known evidence of Egyptian hieroglyphic inscriptions appeared during the predynastic period on Naqada III pottery vessels , dated to about 3200 BC .
In 1982 , the US Mint began minting pennies coated in copper but made primarily of zinc . With the new zinc pennies , there is the potential for zinc toxicosis , which can be fatal . One reported case of chronic ingestion of 425 pennies ( over 1 kg of zinc ) resulted in death due to gastrointestinal bacterial and fungal sepsis , whereas another patient , who ingested 12 grams of zinc , only showed lethargy and ataxia ( gross lack of coordination of muscle movements ) . Several other cases have been reported of humans suffering zinc intoxication by the ingestion of zinc coins .
The game 's media day , which was typically held on the Tuesday afternoon prior to the game , was moved to the Monday evening and re-branded as Super Bowl Opening Night . The event was held on February 1 , 2016 at SAP Center in San Jose . Alongside the traditional media availabilities , the event featured an opening ceremony with player introductions on a replica of the Golden Gate Bridge .
Manning finished the year with a career-low 67.9 passer rating , throwing for 2,249 yards and nine touchdowns , with 17 interceptions . In contrast , Osweiler threw for 1,967 yards , 10 touchdowns and six interceptions for a rating of 86.4 . Veteran receiver Demaryius Thomas led the team with 105 receptions for 1,304 yards and six touchdowns , while Emmanuel Sanders caught 76 passes for 1,135 yards and six scores , while adding another 106 yards returning punts . Tight end Owen Daniels was also a big element of the passing game with 46 receptions for 517 yards . Running back C. J. Anderson was the team 's leading rusher 863 yards and seven touchdowns , while also catching 25 passes for 183 yards . Running back Ronnie Hillman also made a big impact with 720 yards , five touchdowns , 24 receptions , and a 4.7 yards per carry average . Overall , the offense ranked 19th in scoring with 355 points and did not have any Pro Bowl selections .
Martin Luther was born to Hans Luder ( or Ludher , later Luther ) and his wife Margarethe ( née Lindemann ) on 10 November 1483 in Eisleben , Saxony , then part of the Holy Roman Empire . He was baptized as a Catholic the next morning on the feast day of St. Martin of Tours . His family moved to Mansfeld in 1484 , where his father was a leaseholder of copper mines and smelters and served as one of four citizen representatives on the local council . The religious scholar Martin Marty describes Luther 's mother as a hard-working woman of " trading-class stock and middling means " and notes that Luther 's enemies later wrongly described her as a whore and bath attendant . He had several brothers and sisters , and is known to have been close to one of them , Jacob . Hans Luther was ambitious for himself and his family , and he was determined to see Martin , his eldest son , become a lawyer . He sent Martin to Latin schools in Mansfeld , then Magdeburg in 1497 , where he attended a school operated by a lay group called the Brethren of the Common Life , and Eisenach in 1498 . The three schools focused on the so-called " trivium " : grammar , rhetoric , and logic . Luther later compared his education there to purgatory and hell .
Modern Egypt is considered to be a regional and middle power , with significant cultural , political , and military influence in North Africa , the Middle East and the Muslim world . Its economy is one of the largest and most diversified in the Middle East , with sectors such as tourism , agriculture , industry and services at almost equal production levels . In 2011 , longtime President Hosni Mubarak stepped down amid mass protests . Later elections saw the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood , which was ousted by the army a year later amid mass protests .
While these few hard rock bands managed to maintain success and popularity in the early part of the decade , alternative forms of hard rock achieved mainstream success in the form of grunge in the US and Britpop in the UK . This was particularly evident after the success of Nirvana 's Nevermind ( 1991 ) , which combined elements of hardcore punk and heavy metal into a " dirty " sound that made use of heavy guitar distortion , fuzz and feedback , along with darker lyrical themes than their " hair band " predecessors . Although most grunge bands had a sound that sharply contrasted mainstream hard rock , several , including Pearl Jam , Alice in Chains , Mother Love Bone and Soundgarden , were more strongly influenced by 1970s and 1980s rock and metal , while Stone Temple Pilots managed to turn alternative rock into a form of stadium rock . However , all grunge bands shunned the macho , anthemic and fashion-focused aesthetics particularly associated with glam metal . In the UK , Oasis were unusual among the Britpop bands of the mid-1990s in incorporating a hard rock sound .
Since the 1980s , Lutheran Church denominations have repudiated Martin Luther 's statements against the Jews and have rejected the use of them to incite hatred against Lutherans . Strommen et al . 's 1970 survey of 4,745 North American Lutherans aged 15–65 found that , compared to the other minority groups under consideration , Lutherans were the least prejudiced toward Jews . Nevertheless , Professor Richard ( Dick ) Geary , former Professor of Modern History at the University of Nottingham , England , and the author of Hitler and Nazism ( Routledge 1993 ) , wrote in the journal History Today an article on who voted for the Nazis in elections held from 1928-1933 , where he claimed that from his research he found that the Nazis gained disproportionately more votes from Protestant than Catholic areas of Germany .
Often categorised with the New Wave of British Heavy Metal , in 1981 Def Leppard released their second album High 'n ' Dry , mixing glam-rock with heavy metal , and helping to define the sound of hard rock for the decade . The follow-up Pyromania ( 1983 ) , reached number two on the American charts and the singles " Photograph " , " Rock of Ages " and " Foolin ' " , helped by the emergence of MTV , all reached the Top 40 . It was widely emulated , particularly by the emerging Californian glam metal scene . This was followed by US acts like Mötley Crüe , with their albums Too Fast for Love ( 1981 ) and Shout at the Devil ( 1983 ) and , as the style grew , the arrival of bands such as Ratt , White Lion , Twisted Sister and Quiet Riot . Quiet Riot 's album Metal Health ( 1983 ) was the first glam metal album , and arguably the first heavy metal album of any kind , to reach number one in the Billboard music charts and helped open the doors for mainstream success by subsequent bands .
With 4:51 left in regulation , Carolina got the ball on their own 24-yard line with a chance to mount a game-winning drive , and soon faced 3rd-and-9 . On the next play , Miller stripped the ball away from Newton , and after several players dove for it , it took a long bounce backwards and was recovered by Ward , who returned it five yards to the Panthers 4-yard line . Although several players dove into the pile to attempt to recover it , Newton did not and his lack of aggression later earned him heavy criticism . Meanwhile , Denver 's offense was kept out of the end zone for three plays , but a holding penalty on cornerback Josh Norman gave the Broncos a new set of downs . Then Anderson scored on a 2-yard touchdown run and Manning completed a pass to Bennie Fowler for a 2-point conversion , giving Denver a 24–10 lead with 3:08 left and essentially putting the game away . Carolina had two more drives , but failed to get a first down on each one .
To avoid confusing or upsetting the people , Luther avoided extreme change . He also did not wish to replace one controlling system with another . He concentrated on the church in the Electorate of Saxony , acting only as an adviser to churches in new territories , many of which followed his Saxon model . He worked closely with the new elector , John the Steadfast , to whom he turned for secular leadership and funds on behalf of a church largely shorn of its assets and income after the break with Rome . For Luther 's biographer Martin Brecht , this partnership " was the beginning of a questionable and originally unintended development towards a church government under the temporal sovereign " . The elector authorised a visitation of the church , a power formerly exercised by bishops . At times , Luther 's practical reforms fell short of his earlier radical pronouncements . For example , the Instructions for the Visitors of Parish Pastors in Electoral Saxony ( 1528 ) , drafted by Melanchthon with Luther 's approval , stressed the role of repentance in the forgiveness of sins , despite Luther 's position that faith alone ensures justification . The Eisleben reformer Johannes Agricola challenged this compromise , and Luther condemned him for teaching that faith is separate from works . The Instruction is a problematic document for those seeking a consistent evolution in Luther 's thought and practice .
In response to demands for a German liturgy , Luther wrote a German Mass , which he published in early 1526 . He did not intend it as a replacement for his 1523 adaptation of the Latin Mass but as an alternative for the " simple people " , a " public stimulation for people to believe and become Christians . " Luther based his order on the Catholic service but omitted " everything that smacks of sacrifice " ; and the Mass became a celebration where everyone received the wine as well as the bread . He retained the elevation of the host and chalice , while trappings such as the Mass vestments , altar , and candles were made optional , allowing freedom of ceremony . Some reformers , including followers of Huldrych Zwingli , considered Luther 's service too papistic ; and modern scholars note the conservatism of his alternative to the Catholic mass . Luther 's service , however , included congregational singing of hymns and psalms in German , as well as of parts of the liturgy , including Luther 's unison setting of the Creed . To reach the simple people and the young , Luther incorporated religious instruction into the weekday services in the form of the catechism . He also provided simplified versions of the baptism and marriage services .
The official language of the Republic is Modern Standard Arabic . Arabic was adopted by the Egyptians after the Arab invasion of Egypt . The spoken languages are : Egyptian Arabic ( 68 % ) , Sa'idi Arabic ( 29 % ) , Eastern Egyptian Bedawi Arabic ( 1.6 % ) , Sudanese Arabic ( 0.6 % ) , Domari ( 0.3 % ) , Nobiin ( 0.3 % ) , Beja ( 0.1 % ) , Siwi and others . Additionally , Greek , Armenian and Italian are the main languages of immigrants . In Alexandria in the 19th century there was a large community of Italian Egyptians and Italian was the " lingua franca " of the city .
The Broncos defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers in the divisional round , 23–16 , by scoring 11 points in the final three minutes of the game . They then beat the defending Super Bowl XLIX champion New England Patriots in the AFC Championship Game , 20–18 , by intercepting a pass on New England 's 2-point conversion attempt with 17 seconds left on the clock . Despite Manning 's problems with interceptions during the season , he did n't throw any in their two playoff games .
The Negritos are believed to be the first inhabitants of Southeast Asia . Once inhabiting Taiwan , Vietnam , and various other parts of Asia , they are now confined primarily to Thailand , the Malay Archipelago , and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands . Negrito means " little black people " in Spanish ( negrito is the Spanish diminutive of negro , i.e. , " little black person " ) ; it is what the Spaniards called the short-statured , hunter-gatherer autochthones that they encountered in the Philippines . Despite this , Negritos are never referred to as black today , and doing so would cause offense . The term Negrito itself has come under criticism in countries like Malaysia , where it is now interchangeable with the more acceptable Semang , although this term actually refers to a specific group . The common Thai word for Negritos literally means " frizzy hair " .
The defined dogma of the Immaculate Conception regards original sin only , saying that Mary was preserved from any stain ( in Latin , macula or labes , the second of these two synonymous words being the one used in the formal definition ) . The proclaimed Roman Catholic dogma states " that the most Blessed Virgin Mary , in the first instance of her conception , by a singular grace and privilege granted by Almighty God , in view of the merits of Jesus Christ , the Saviour of the human race , was preserved free from all stain of original sin . " Therefore , being always free from original sin , the doctrine teaches that from her conception Mary received the sanctifying grace that would normally come with baptism after birth .
In 1501 , at the age of 19 , he entered the University of Erfurt , which he later described as a beerhouse and whorehouse . He was made to wake at four every morning for what has been described as " a day of rote learning and often wearying spiritual exercises . " He received his master 's degree in 1505 .
Afro-Spaniards are Spanish nationals of West/Central African descent . They today mainly come from Angola , Brazil , Cameroon , Cape Verde , Equatorial Guinea , Ghana , Gambia , Guinea-Bissau , Mali , Nigeria and Senegal . Additionally , many Afro-Spaniards born in Spain are from the former Spanish colony Equatorial Guinea . Today , there are an estimated 683,000 Afro-Spaniards in Spain .
It is admitted that the doctrine as defined by Pius IX was not explicitly mooted before the 12th century . It is also agreed that " no direct or categorical and stringent proof of the dogma can be brought forward from Scripture " . But it is claimed that the doctrine is implicitly contained in the teaching of the Fathers . Their expressions on the subject of the sinlessness of Mary are , it is pointed out , so ample and so absolute that they must be taken to include original sin as well as actual . Thus in the first five centuries such epithets as " in every respect holy " , " in all things unstained " , " super-innocent " , and " singularly holy " are applied to her ; she is compared to Eve before the fall , as ancestress of a redeemed people ; she is " the earth before it was accursed " . The well-known words of St. Augustine ( d. 430 ) may be cited : " As regards the mother of God , " he says , " I will not allow any question whatever of sin . " It is true that he is here speaking directly of actual or personal sin . But his argument is that all men are sinners ; that they are so through original depravity ; that this original depravity may be overcome by the grace of God , and he adds that he does not know but that Mary may have had sufficient grace to overcome sin " of every sort " ( omni ex parte ) .
Cairo University is ranked as 401-500 according to the Academic Ranking of World Universities ( Shanghai Ranking ) and 551-600 according to QS World University Rankings . American University in Cairo is ranked as 360 according to QS World University Rankings and Al-Azhar University , Alexandria University and Ain Shams University fall in the 701+ range . Egypt is currently opening new research institutes for the aim of modernising research in the nation , the most recent example of which is Zewail City of Science and Technology .
The medieval city is a foundation of the Zähringer ruling family , which rose to power in Upper Burgundy in the 12th century . According to 14th century historiography ( Cronica de Berno , 1309 ) , Bern was founded in 1191 by Berthold V , Duke of Zähringen .
Numerous communities of dark-skinned peoples are present in North Africa , some dating from prehistoric communities . Others are descendants of the historical Trans-Saharan trade in peoples and/or , and after the Arab invasions of North Africa in the 7th century , descendants of slaves from the Arab Slave Trade in North Africa .
A mandolin ( Italian : mandolino pronounced [ mandoˈliːno ] ; literally " small mandola " ) is a musical instrument in the lute family and is usually plucked with a plectrum or " pick " . It commonly has four courses of doubled metal strings tuned in unison ( 8 strings ) , although five ( 10 strings ) and six ( 12 strings ) course versions also exist . The courses are normally tuned in a succession of perfect fifths . It is the soprano member of a family that includes the mandola , octave mandolin , mandocello and mandobass .
Martin Luther , who initiated the Protestant Reformation , said : " Mother Mary , like us , was born in sin of sinful parents , but the Holy Spirit covered her , sanctified and purified her so that this child was born of flesh and blood , but not with sinful flesh and blood . The Holy Spirit permitted the Virgin Mary to remain a true , natural human being of flesh and blood , just as we . However , he warded off sin from her flesh and blood so that she became the mother of a pure child , not poisoned by sin as we are . For in that moment when she conceived , she was a holy mother filled with the Holy Spirit and her fruit is a holy pure fruit , at once God and truly man , in one person . " Some Lutherans , such as the members of the Anglo-Lutheran Catholic Church , support the doctrine .
This was the first Super Bowl to feature a quarterback on both teams who was the # 1 pick in their draft classes . Manning was the # 1 selection of the 1998 NFL draft , while Newton was picked first in 2011 . The matchup also pits the top two picks of the 2011 draft against each other : Newton for Carolina and Von Miller for Denver . Manning and Newton also set the record for the largest age difference between opposing Super Bowl quarterbacks at 13 years and 48 days ( Manning was 39 , Newton was 26 ) .
In 1964 , CBS established its own UK distribution with the acquisition of Oriole Records . EMI continued to distribute Epic and Okeh label material on the Columbia label in the UK until the distribution deal with EMI expired in 1968 when CBS took over distribution .
In 1960 , Columbia/CBS began negotiations with its main international distributor Philips Records with the goal of CBS starting its own global record company . Philips ' acquisition of Mercury Records in the US in 1961 paved the way for this . CBS only had the rights to the Columbia name in North America ; therefore the international arm founded in 1961 and launched in 1962 utilized the " CBS Records " name only , with Philips Records distributing the label in Europe . CBS 's Mexican record company , Discos Columbia , was renamed Discos CBS by 1963 .
When Cowan Powers and his family recorded their old-time music from 1924-1926 , his daughter Orpha Powers was one of the earliest known southern-music artists to record with the mandolin . By the 1930s , single mandolins were becoming more commonly used in southern string band music , most notably by brother duets such as the sedate Blue Sky Boys ( Bill Bolick and Earl Bolick ) and the more hard-driving Monroe Brothers ( Bill Monroe and Charlie Monroe ) . However , the mandolin 's modern popularity in country music can be directly traced to one man : Bill Monroe , the father of bluegrass music . After the Monroe Brothers broke up in 1939 , Bill Monroe formed his own group , after a brief time called the Blue Grass Boys , and completed the transition of mandolin styles from a " parlor " sound typical of brother duets to the modern " bluegrass " style . He joined the Grand Ole Opry in 1939 and its powerful clear-channel broadcast signal on WSM-AM spread his style throughout the South , directly inspiring many musicians to take up the mandolin . Monroe famously played Gibson F-5 mandolin , signed and dated July 9 , 1923 , by Lloyd Loar , chief acoustic engineer at Gibson . The F-5 has since become the most imitated tonally and aesthetically by modern builders .
Luther spoke out against the Jews in Saxony , Brandenburg , and Silesia . Josel of Rosheim , the Jewish spokesman who tried to help the Jews of Saxony in 1537 , later blamed their plight on " that priest whose name was Martin Luther—may his body and soul be bound up in hell ! —who wrote and issued many heretical books in which he said that whoever would help the Jews was doomed to perdition . " Josel asked the city of Strasbourg to forbid the sale of Luther 's anti-Jewish works : they refused initially , but did so when a Lutheran pastor in Hochfelden used a sermon to urge his parishioners to murder Jews . Luther 's influence persisted after his death . Throughout the 1580s , riots led to the expulsion of Jews from several German Lutheran states .
On December 28 , 2015 , ESPN Deportes announced that they had reached an agreement with CBS and the NFL to be the exclusive Spanish-language broadcaster of the game , marking the third dedicated Spanish-language broadcast of the Super Bowl . Unlike NBC and Fox , CBS does not have a Spanish-language outlet of its own that could broadcast the game ( though per league policy , a separate Spanish play-by-play call was carried on CBS 's second audio program channel for over-the-air viewers ) . The game was called by ESPN Deportes ' Monday Night Football commentary crew of Alvaro Martin and Raul Allegre , and sideline reporter John Sutcliffe . ESPN Deportes broadcast pre-game and post-game coverage , while Martin , Allegre , and Sutcliffe contributed English-language reports for ESPN 's SportsCenter and Mike & Mike .
The second decline was not as complete as the first . Thousands of people had learned to play the instrument . Even as the second wave of mandolin popularity declined in the early 20th century , new versions of the mandolin began to be used in new forms of music . Luthiers created the resonator mandolin , the flatback mandolin , the carved-top or arched-top mandolin , the mandolin-banjo and the electric mandolin . Musicians began playing it in Celtic , Bluegrass , Jazz and Rock-n-Roll styles — and Classical too .
Possibly as early as the second century AD , Virgil 's works were seen as having magical properties and were used for divination . In what became known as the Sortes Vergilianae ( Virgilian Lots ) , passages would be selected at random and interpreted to answer questions . In the 12th century , starting around Naples but eventually spreading widely throughout Europe , a tradition developed in which Virgil was regarded as a great magician . Legends about Virgil and his magical powers remained popular for over two hundred years , arguably becoming as prominent as his writings themselves . Virgil 's legacy in medieval Wales was such that the Welsh version of his name , Fferyllt or Pheryllt , became a generic term for magic-worker , and survives in the modern Welsh word for pharmacist , fferyllydd .
Like any plucked instrument , mandolin notes decay to silence rather than sound out continuously as with a bowed note on a violin , and mandolin notes decay faster than larger stringed instruments like the guitar . This encourages the use of tremolo ( rapid picking of one or more pairs of strings ) to create sustained notes or chords . The mandolin 's paired strings facilitate this technique : the plectrum ( pick ) strikes each of a pair of strings alternately , providing a more full and continuous sound than a single string would .
The last ruler from the Ptolemaic line was Cleopatra VII , who committed suicide following the burial of her lover Mark Antony who had died in her arms ( from a self-inflicted stab wound ) , after Octavian had captured Alexandria and her mercenary forces had fled . The Ptolemies faced rebellions of native Egyptians often caused by an unwanted regime and were involved in foreign and civil wars that led to the decline of the kingdom and its annexation by Rome . Nevertheless , Hellenistic culture continued to thrive in Egypt well after the Muslim conquest .
In honor of the 50th Super Bowl , the pregame ceremony featured the on-field introduction of 39 of the 43 previous Super Bowl Most Valuable Players . Bart Starr ( MVP of Super Bowls I and II ) and Chuck Howley ( MVP of Super Bowl V ) appeared via video , while Peyton Manning ( MVP of Super Bowl XLI and current Broncos quarterback ) was shown in the locker room preparing for the game . No plans were announced regarding the recognition of Harvey Martin , co-MVP of Super Bowl XII , who died in 2001 .
With over 90 million inhabitants , Egypt is the most populous country in North Africa and the Arab World , the third-most populous in Africa ( after Nigeria and Ethiopia ) , and the fifteenth-most populous in the world . The great majority of its people live near the banks of the Nile River , an area of about 40,000 square kilometres ( 15,000 sq mi ) , where the only arable land is found . The large regions of the Sahara desert , which constitute most of Egypt 's territory , are sparsely inhabited . About half of Egypt 's residents live in urban areas , with most spread across the densely populated centres of greater Cairo , Alexandria and other major cities in the Nile Delta .
The tradition holds that Virgil was born in the village of Andes , near Mantua in Cisalpine Gaul . Analysis of his name has led to beliefs that he descended from earlier Roman colonists . Modern speculation ultimately is not supported by narrative evidence either from his own writings or his later biographers . Macrobius says that Virgil 's father was of a humble background ; however , scholars generally believe that Virgil was from an equestrian landowning family which could afford to give him an education . He attended schools in Cremona , Mediolanum , Rome and Naples . After considering briefly a career in rhetoric and law , the young Virgil turned his talents to poetry .
As the designated home team in the annual rotation between AFC and NFC teams , the Broncos elected to wear their road white jerseys with matching white pants . Elway stated , " We 've had Super Bowl success in our white uniforms . " The Broncos last wore matching white jerseys and pants in the Super Bowl in Super Bowl XXXIII , Elway 's last game as Denver QB , when they defeated the Atlanta Falcons 34–19 . In their only other Super Bowl win in Super Bowl XXXII , Denver wore blue jerseys , which was their primary color at the time . They also lost Super Bowl XXI when they wore white jerseys , but they are 0-4 in Super Bowls when wearing orange jerseys , losing in Super Bowl XII , XXII , XXIV , and XLVIII . The only other AFC champion team to have worn white as the designated home team in the Super Bowl was the Pittsburgh Steelers ; they defeated the Seattle Seahawks 21–10 in Super Bowl XL 10 seasons prior . The Broncos ' decision to wear white meant the Panthers would wear their standard home uniform : black jerseys with silver pants .
As in Brazil , the mandolin has played an important role in the Music of Venezuela . It has enjoyed a privileged position as the main melodic instrument in several different regions of the country . Specifically , the eastern states of Sucre , Nueva Esparta , Anzoategui and Monagas have made the mandolin the main instrument in their versions of Joropo as well as Puntos , Jotas , Polos , Fulias , Merengues and Malagueñas . Also , in the west of the country the sound of the mandolin is intrinsically associated with the regional genres of the Venezuelan Andes : Bambucos , Pasillos , Pasodobles , and Waltzes . In the western city of Maracaibo the Mandolin has been played in Decimas , Danzas and Contradanzas Zulianas ; in the capital , Caracas , the Merengue Rucaneao , Pasodobles and Waltzes have also been played with mandolin for almost a century . Today , Venezuelan mandolists include an important group of virtuoso players and ensembles such as Alberto Valderrama , Jesus Rengel , Ricardo Sandoval , Saul Vera , and Cristobal Soto .
As African states became independent in the 1960s , the Soviet Union offered many of their citizens the chance to study in Russia . Over a period of 40 years , about 400,000 African students from various countries moved to Russia to pursue higher studies , including many Black Africans . This extended beyond the Soviet Union to many countries of the Eastern bloc .
Following their loss in the divisional round of the previous season 's playoffs , the Denver Broncos underwent numerous coaching changes , including a mutual parting with head coach John Fox ( who had won four divisional championships in his four years as Broncos head coach ) , and the hiring of Gary Kubiak as the new head coach . Under Kubiak , the Broncos planned to install a run-oriented offense with zone blocking to blend in with quarterback Peyton Manning 's shotgun passing skills , but struggled with numerous changes and injuries to the offensive line , as well as Manning having his worst statistical season since his rookie year with the Indianapolis Colts in 1998 , due to a plantar fasciitis injury in his heel that he had suffered since the summer , and the simple fact that Manning was getting old , as he turned 39 in the 2015 off-season . Although the team had a 7–0 start , Manning led the NFL in interceptions . In week 10 , Manning suffered a partial tear of the plantar fasciitis in his left foot . He set the NFL 's all-time record for career passing yards in this game , but was benched after throwing four interceptions in favor of backup quarterback Brock Osweiler , who took over as the starter for most of the remainder of the regular season . Osweiler was injured , however , leading to Manning 's return during the Week 17 regular season finale , where the Broncos were losing 13–7 against the 4–11 San Diego Chargers , resulting in Manning re-claiming the starting quarterback position for the playoffs by leading the team to a key 27–20 win that enabled the team to clinch the number one overall AFC seed . Under defensive coordinator Wade Phillips , the Broncos ' defense ranked number one in total yards allowed , passing yards allowed and sacks , and like the previous three seasons , the team has continued to set numerous individual , league and franchise records . With the defense carrying the team despite the issues with the offense , the Broncos finished the regular season with a 12–4 record and earned home-field advantage throughout the AFC playoffs .
The First Intermediate Period ushered in a time of political upheaval for about 150 years . Stronger Nile floods and stabilisation of government , however , brought back renewed prosperity for the country in the Middle Kingdom c. 2040 BC , reaching a peak during the reign of Pharaoh Amenemhat III . A second period of disunity heralded the arrival of the first foreign ruling dynasty in Egypt , that of the Semitic Hyksos . The Hyksos invaders took over much of Lower Egypt around 1650 BC and founded a new capital at Avaris . They were driven out by an Upper Egyptian force led by Ahmose I , who founded the Eighteenth Dynasty and relocated the capital from Memphis to Thebes .
The service started on 1 September 1993 based on the idea from the then chief executive officer , Sam Chisholm and Rupert Murdoch , of converting the company business strategy to an entirely fee-based concept . The new package included four channels formerly available free-to-air , broadcasting on Astra 's satellites , as well as introducing new channels . The service continued until the closure of BSkyB 's analogue service on 27 September 2001 , due to the launch and expansion of the Sky Digital platform . Some of the channels did broadcast either in the clear or soft encrypted ( whereby a Videocrypt decoder was required to decode , without a subscription card ) prior to their addition to the Sky Multichannels package . Within two months of the launch , BSkyB gained 400,000 new subscribers , with the majority taking at least one premium channel as well , which helped BSkyB reach 3.5 million households by mid-1994 . Michael Grade criticized the operations in front of the Select Committee on National Heritage , mainly for the lack of original programming on many of the new channels .
In 2004 , SME and Bertelsmann Music Group merged as Sony BMG Music Entertainment . When Sony acquired BMG 's half of the conglomerate in 2008 , Sony BMG reverted to the SME name . The buyout led to the dissolution of BMG , which then relaunched as BMG Rights Management . Out of the " Big Three " record companies , with Universal Music Group being the largest and Warner Music Group , SME is middle-sized .
Mary 's complete sinlessness and concomitant exemption from any taint from the first moment of her existence was a doctrine familiar to Greek theologians of Byzantium . Beginning with St. Gregory Nazianzen , his explanation of the " purification " of Jesus and Mary at the circumcision ( Luke 2:22 ) prompted him to consider the primary meaning of " purification " in Christology ( and by extension in Mariology ) to refer to a perfectly sinless nature that manifested itself in glory in a moment of grace ( e.g. , Jesus at his Baptism ) . St. Gregory Nazianzen designated Mary as " prokathartheisa ( prepurified ) . " Gregory likely attempted to solve the riddle of the Purification of Jesus and Mary in the Temple through considering the human natures of Jesus and Mary as equally holy and therefore both purified in this manner of grace and glory . Gregory 's doctrines surrounding Mary 's purification were likely related to the burgeoning commemoration of the Mother of God in and around Constantinople very close to the date of Christmas . Nazianzen 's title of Mary at the Annunciation as " prepurified " was subsequently adopted by all theologians interested in his Mariology to justify the Byzantine equivalent of the Immaculate Conception . This is especially apparent in the Fathers St. Sophronios of Jerusalem and St. John Damascene , who will be treated below in this article at the section on Church Fathers . About the time of Damascene , the public celebration of the " Conception of St. Ann [ i.e. , of the Theotokos in her womb ] " was becoming popular . After this period , the " purification " of the perfect natures of Jesus and Mary would not only mean moments of grace and glory at the Incarnation and Baptism and other public Byzantine liturgical feasts , but purification was eventually associated with the feast of Mary 's very conception ( along with her Presentation in the Temple as a toddler ) by Orthodox authors of the 2nd millennium ( e.g. , St. Nicholas Cabasilas and Joseph Bryennius ) .
A few hard rock bands from the 1970s and 1980s managed to sustain highly successful recording careers . Bon Jovi were still able to achieve a commercial hit with " It 's My Life " from their double platinum-certified album Crush ( 2000 ) . and AC/DC released the platinum-certified Stiff Upper Lip ( 2000 ) Aerosmith released a number two platinum album , Just Push Play ( 2001 ) , which saw the band foray further into pop with the Top 10 hit " Jaded " , and a blues cover album , Honkin ' on Bobo , which reached number five in 2004 . Heart achieved their first Top 10 album since the early 90s with Red Velvet Car in 2010 , becoming the first female-led hard rock band to earn Top 10 albums spanning five decades . There were reunions and subsequent tours from Van Halen ( with Hagar in 2004 and then Roth in 2007 ) , The Who ( delayed in 2002 by the death of bassist John Entwistle until 2006 ) and Black Sabbath ( with Osbourne 1997–2006 and Dio 2006–2010 ) and even a one off performance by Led Zeppelin ( 2007 ) , renewing the interest in previous eras . Additionally , hard rock supergroups , such as Audioslave ( with former members of Rage Against the Machine and Soundgarden ) and Velvet Revolver ( with former members of Guns N ' Roses , punk band Wasted Youth and Stone Temple Pilots singer Scott Weiland ) , emerged and experienced some success . However , these bands were short-lived , ending in 2007 and 2008 , respectively . The long awaited Guns N ' Roses album Chinese Democracy was finally released in 2008 , but only went platinum and failed to come close to the success of the band 's late 1980s and early 1990s material . More successfully , AC/DC released the double platinum-certified Black Ice ( 2008 ) . Bon Jovi continued to enjoy success , branching into country music with " Who Says You Ca n't Go Home " , which reached number one on the Hot Country Singles chart in 2006 , and the rock/country album Lost Highway , which reached number one in 2007 . In 2009 , Bon Jovi released another number one album , The Circle , which marked a return to their hard rock sound .
CBS provided digital streams of the game via CBSSports.com , and the CBS Sports apps on tablets , Windows 10 , Xbox One and other digital media players ( such as Chromecast and Roku ) . Due to Verizon Communications exclusivity , streaming on smartphones was only provided to Verizon Wireless customers via the NFL Mobile service . The ESPN Deportes Spanish broadcast was made available through WatchESPN .
The Broncos defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers in the divisional round , 23–16 , by scoring 11 points in the final three minutes of the game . They then beat the defending Super Bowl XLIX champion New England Patriots in the AFC Championship Game , 20–18 , by intercepting a pass on New England 's 2-point conversion attempt with 17 seconds left on the clock . Despite Manning 's problems with interceptions during the season , he did n't throw any in their two playoff games .
There would be no more scoring in the third quarter , but early in the fourth , the Broncos drove to the Panthers 41-yard line . On the next play , Ealy knocked the ball out of Manning 's hand as he was winding up for a pass , and then recovered it for Carolina on the 50-yard line . A 16-yard reception by Devin Funchess and a 12-yard run by Stewart then set up Gano 's 39-yard field goal , cutting the Panthers deficit to one score at 16–10 . The next three drives of the game would end in punts .
On 31 October 1517 , Luther wrote to his bishop , Albert of Mainz , protesting the sale of indulgences . He enclosed in his letter a copy of his " Disputation of Martin Luther on the Power and Efficacy of Indulgences " , which came to be known as The Ninety-Five Theses . Hans Hillerbrand writes that Luther had no intention of confronting the church , but saw his disputation as a scholarly objection to church practices , and the tone of the writing is accordingly " searching , rather than doctrinaire . " Hillerbrand writes that there is nevertheless an undercurrent of challenge in several of the theses , particularly in Thesis 86 , which asks : " Why does the pope , whose wealth today is greater than the wealth of the richest Crassus , build the basilica of St. Peter with the money of poor believers rather than with his own money ? "
The Panthers seemed primed to score on their opening drive of the second half when Newton completed a 45-yard pass to Ted Ginn Jr. on the Denver 35-yard line on their second offensive play . But the Broncos defense halted the drive on the 26-yard line , and it ended with no points when Graham Gano hit the uprights on a 44-yard field goal attempt . After the miss , Manning completed a pair of passes to Emmanuel Sanders for gains of 25 and 22 yards , setting up McManus ' 33-yard field goal that gave the Broncos a 16–7 lead . Carolina got off to another strong start after the kickoff , with Newton completing a 42-yard pass to Corey Brown . But once again they came up empty , this time as a result of a Newton pass that bounced off the hands of Ginn and was intercepted by safety T. J . Ward . Ward fumbled the ball during the return , but Trevathan recovered it to enable Denver to keep possession .
Luther wrote about the Jews throughout his career , though only a few of his works dealt with them directly . Luther rarely encountered Jews during his life , but his attitudes reflected a theological and cultural tradition which saw Jews as a rejected people guilty of the murder of Christ , and he lived within a local community that had expelled Jews some ninety years earlier . He considered the Jews blasphemers and liars because they rejected the divinity of Jesus , whereas Christians believed Jesus was the Messiah . But Luther believed that all human beings who set themselves against God were equally guilty . As early as 1516 , he wrote that many people " are proud with marvelous stupidity when they call the Jews dogs , evildoers , or whatever they like , while they too , and equally , do not realize who or what they are in the sight of God " . In 1523 , Luther advised kindness toward the Jews in That Jesus Christ was Born a Jew and also aimed to convert them to Christianity . When his efforts at conversion failed , he grew increasingly bitter toward them . In his 2010 book Bonhoeffer : Pastor , Martyr , Prophet , Spy , Christian author Eric Metaxas claimed that Luther 's attitude towards Jews " unraveled along with his health . "
Luther 's 1524 creedal hymn " Wir glauben all an einen Gott " ( " We All Believe in One True God " ) is a three-stanza confession of faith prefiguring Luther 's 1529 three-part explanation of the Apostles ' Creed in the Small Catechism . Luther 's hymn , adapted and expanded from an earlier German creedal hymn , gained widespread use in vernacular Lutheran liturgies as early as 1525 . Sixteenth-century Lutheran hymnals also included " Wir glauben all " among the catechetical hymns , although 18th-century hymnals tended to label the hymn as Trinitarian rather than catechetical , and 20th-century Lutherans rarely use the hymn because of the perceived difficulty of its tune .
On Carolina 's next possession fullback Mike Tolbert lost a fumble while being tackled by safety Darian Stewart , which linebacker Danny Trevathan recovered on the Broncos 40-yard line . However , the Panthers soon took the ball back when defensive end Kony Ealy tipped a Manning pass to himself and then intercepted it , returning the ball 19 yards to the Panthers 39-yard line with 1:55 left on the clock . The Panthers could not gain any yards with their possession and had to punt . After a Denver punt , Carolina drove to the Broncos 45-yard line . But with 11 seconds left , Newton was sacked by DeMarcus Ware as time expired in the half .
Bon Jovi 's third album , Slippery When Wet ( 1986 ) , mixed hard rock with a pop sensitivity and spent a total of 8 weeks at the top of the Billboard 200 album chart , selling 12 million copies in the US while becoming the first hard rock album to spawn three top 10 singles — two of which reached number one . The album has been credited with widening the audiences for the genre , particularly by appealing to women as well as the traditional male dominated audience , and opening the door to MTV and commercial success for other bands at the end of the decade . The anthemic The Final Countdown ( 1986 ) by Swedish group Europe was an international hit , reaching number eight on the US charts while hitting the top 10 in nine other countries . This era also saw more glam-infused American hard rock bands come to the forefront , with both Poison and Cinderella releasing their multi-platinum début albums in 1986 . Van Halen released 5150 ( 1986 ) , their first album with Sammy Hagar on lead vocals , which was number one in the US for three weeks and sold over 6 million copies . By the second half of the decade , hard rock had become the most reliable form of commercial popular music in the United States .
The Panthers offense , which led the NFL in scoring ( 500 points ) , was loaded with talent , boasting six Pro Bowl selections . Pro Bowl quarterback Cam Newton had one of his best seasons , throwing for 3,837 yards and rushing for 636 , while recording a career-high and league-leading 45 total touchdowns ( 35 passing , 10 rushing ) , a career-low 10 interceptions , and a career-best quarterback rating of 99.4 . Newton 's leading receivers were tight end Greg Olsen , who caught a career-high 77 passes for 1,104 yards and seven touchdowns , and wide receiver Ted Ginn , Jr. , who caught 44 passes for 739 yards and 10 touchdowns ; Ginn also rushed for 60 yards and returned 27 punts for 277 yards . Other key receivers included veteran Jerricho Cotchery ( 39 receptions for 485 yards ) , rookie Devin Funchess ( 31 receptions for 473 yards and five touchdowns ) , and second-year receiver Corey Brown ( 31 receptions for 447 yards ) . The Panthers backfield featured Pro Bowl running back Jonathan Stewart , who led the team with 989 rushing yards and six touchdowns in 13 games , along with Pro Bowl fullback Mike Tolbert , who rushed for 256 yards and caught 18 passes for another 154 yards . Carolina 's offensive line also featured two Pro Bowl selections : center Ryan Kalil and guard Trai Turner .
In the United States , the game was televised by CBS , as part of a cycle between the three main broadcast television partners of the NFL . The network 's lead broadcast team of Jim Nantz and Phil Simms called the contest , with Tracy Wolfson and Evan Washburn on the sidelines . CBS introduced new features during the telecast , including pylon cameras and microphones along with EyeVision 360—an array of 36 cameras along the upper deck that can be used to provide a 360-degree view of plays and " bullet time " effects . ( An earlier version of EyeVision was last used in Super Bowl XXXV ; for Super Bowl 50 , the cameras were upgraded to 5K resolution . )
Emerging British acts included Free , who released their signature song " All Right Now " ( 1970 ) , which has received extensive radio airplay in both the UK and US . After the breakup of the band in 1973 , vocalist Paul Rodgers joined supergroup Bad Company , whose eponymous first album ( 1974 ) was an international hit . The mixture of hard rock and progressive rock , evident in the works of Deep Purple , was pursued more directly by bands like Uriah Heep and Argent . Scottish band Nazareth released their self-titled début album in 1971 , producing a blend of hard rock and pop that would culminate in their best selling , Hair of the Dog ( 1975 ) , which contained the proto-power ballad " Love Hurts " . Having enjoyed some national success in the early 1970s , Queen , after the release of Sheer Heart Attack ( 1974 ) and A Night at the Opera ( 1975 ) , gained international recognition with a sound that used layered vocals and guitars and mixed hard rock with heavy metal , progressive rock , and even opera . The latter featured the single " Bohemian Rhapsody " , which stayed at number one in the UK charts for nine weeks .
Political and economic relations were drastically influenced by these theories as the concept of the guild was subordinated to the theory of free trade , and Roman Catholic dominance of theology was increasingly challenged by Protestant churches subordinate to each nation-state , which also ( in a fashion the Roman Catholic Church often decried angrily ) preached in the vulgar or native language of each region . However , the enlightenment was an outright attack on religion , particularly Christianity . The most outspoken critic of the church in France was François Marie Arouet de Voltaire , a representative figure of the enlightenment . After Voltaire , religion would never be the same again in France .
On 15 June 1520 , the Pope warned Luther with the papal bull ( edict ) Exsurge Domine that he risked excommunication unless he recanted 41 sentences drawn from his writings , including the 95 Theses , within 60 days . That autumn , Johann Eck proclaimed the bull in Meissen and other towns . Karl von Miltitz , a papal nuncio , attempted to broker a solution , but Luther , who had sent the Pope a copy of On the Freedom of a Christian in October , publicly set fire to the bull and decretals at Wittenberg on 10 December 1520 , an act he defended in Why the Pope and his Recent Book are Burned and Assertions Concerning All Articles . As a consequence , Luther was excommunicated by Pope Leo X on 3 January 1521 , in the bull Decet Romanum Pontificem .
From December 1539 , Luther became implicated in the bigamy of Philip I , Landgrave of Hesse , who wanted to marry one of his wife 's ladies-in-waiting . Philip solicited the approval of Luther , Melanchthon , and Bucer , citing as a precedent the polygamy of the patriarchs . The theologians were not prepared to make a general ruling , and they reluctantly advised the landgrave that if he was determined , he should marry secretly and keep quiet about the matter . As a result , on 4 March 1540 , Philip married a second wife , Margarethe von der Saale , with Melanchthon and Bucer among the witnesses . However , Philip was unable to keep the marriage secret , and he threatened to make Luther 's advice public . Luther told him to " tell a good , strong lie " and deny the marriage completely , which Philip did during the subsequent public controversy . In the view of Luther 's biographer Martin Brecht , " giving confessional advice for Philip of Hesse was one of the worst mistakes Luther made , and , next to the landgrave himself , who was directly responsible for it , history chiefly holds Luther accountable " . Brecht argues that Luther 's mistake was not that he gave private pastoral advice , but that he miscalculated the political implications . The affair caused lasting damage to Luther 's reputation .
Virgil 's biographical tradition is thought to depend on a lost biography by Varius , Virgil 's editor , which was incorporated into the biography by Suetonius and the commentaries of Servius and Donatus , the two great commentators on Virgil 's poetry . Although the commentaries no doubt record much factual information about Virgil , some of their evidence can be shown to rely on inferences made from his poetry and allegorizing ; thus , Virgil 's biographical tradition remains problematic .
The New Kingdom c. 1550–1070 BC began with the Eighteenth Dynasty , marking the rise of Egypt as an international power that expanded during its greatest extension to an empire as far south as Tombos in Nubia , and included parts of the Levant in the east . This period is noted for some of the most well known Pharaohs , including Hatshepsut , Thutmose III , Akhenaten and his wife Nefertiti , Tutankhamun and Ramesses II . The first historically attested expression of monotheism came during this period as Atenism . Frequent contacts with other nations brought new ideas to the New Kingdom . The country was later invaded and conquered by Libyans , Nubians and Assyrians , but native Egyptians eventually drove them out and regained control of their country .
The rise of Islam , based on both the Qur'an and Muhammad strongly altered the power balances and perceptions of origin of power in the Mediterranean region . Early Islamic philosophy emphasized an inexorable link between science and religion , and the process of ijtihad to find truth—in effect all philosophy was " political " as it had real implications for governance . This view was challenged by the " rationalist " Mutazilite philosophers , who held a more Hellenic view , reason above revelation , and as such are known to modern scholars as the first speculative theologians of Islam ; they were supported by a secular aristocracy who sought freedom of action independent of the Caliphate . By the late ancient period , however , the " traditionalist " Asharite view of Islam had in general triumphed . According to the Asharites , reason must be subordinate to the Quran and the Sunna .
Bern has a population of 140,634 people and 34 % of the population are resident foreign nationals . Over the 10 years between 2000 and 2010 , the population changed at a rate of 0.6 % . Migration accounted for 1.3 % , while births and deaths accounted for −2.1 % .
Another debate developed around the ( distinct ) criticisms of liberal political theory made by Michael Walzer , Michael Sandel and Charles Taylor . The liberal-communitarian debate is often considered valuable for generating a new set of philosophical problems , rather than a profound and illuminating clash of perspective.These and other communitarians ( such as Alasdair MacIntyre and Daniel A . Bell ) argue that , contra liberalism , communities are prior to individuals and therefore should be the center of political focus . Communitarians tend to support greater local control as well as economic and social policies which encourage the growth of social capital .
Martin Luther married Katharina von Bora , one of 12 nuns he had helped escape from the Nimbschen Cistercian convent in April 1523 , when he arranged for them to be smuggled out in herring barrels . " Suddenly , and while I was occupied with far different thoughts , " he wrote to Wenceslaus Link , " the Lord has plunged me into marriage . " At the time of their marriage , Katharina was 26 years old and Luther was 41 years old .
Formed in November 1990 by the equal merger of Sky Television and British Satellite Broadcasting , BSkyB became the UK 's largest digital subscription television company . Following BSkyB 's 2014 acquisition of Sky Italia and a majority 90.04 % interest in Sky Deutschland in November 2014 , its holding company British Sky Broadcasting Group plc changed its name to Sky plc . The United Kingdom operations also changed the company name from British Sky Broadcasting Limited to Sky UK Limited , still trading as Sky .
By 750 , the feast of her conception was widely celebrated in the Byzantine East , under the name of the Conception ( active ) of Saint Anne . In the West it was known as the feast of the Conception ( passive ) of Mary , and was associated particularly with the Normans , whether these introduced it directly from the East or took it from English usage . The spread of the feast , by now with the adjective " Immaculate " attached to its title , met opposition on the part of some , on the grounds that sanctification was possible only after conception . Critics included Saints Bernard of Clairvaux , Albertus Magnus and Thomas Aquinas . Other theologians defended the expression " Immaculate Conception " , pointing out that sanctification could be conferred at the first moment of conception in view of the foreseen merits of Christ , a view held especially by Franciscans .
It seems to have been St Bernard of Clairvaux who , in the 12th century , explicitly raised the question of the Immaculate Conception . A feast of the Conception of the Blessed Virgin had already begun to be celebrated in some churches of the West . St Bernard blames the canons of the metropolitan church of Lyon for instituting such a festival without the permission of the Holy See . In doing so , he takes occasion to repudiate altogether the view that the conception of Mary was sinless . It is doubtful , however , whether he was using the term " conception " in the same sense in which it is used in the definition of Pope Pius IX . Bernard would seem to have been speaking of conception in the active sense of the mother 's cooperation , for in his argument he says : " How can there be absence of sin where there is concupiscence ( libido ) ? " and stronger expressions follow , showing that he is speaking of the mother and not of the child .
Mandolin awareness in the United States blossomed in the 1880s , as the instrument became part of a fad that continued into the mid-1920s . According to Clarence L. Partee , the first mandolin made in the United States was made in 1883 or 1884 by Joseph Bohmann , who was an established maker of violins in Chicago . Partee characterized the early instrument as being larger than the European instruments he was used to , with a " peculiar shape " and " crude construction , " and said that the quality improved , until American instruments were " superior " to imported instruments . At the time , Partee was using an imported French-made mandolin .
The element was probably named by the alchemist Paracelsus after the German word Zinke ( prong , tooth ) . German chemist Andreas Sigismund Marggraf is credited with discovering pure metallic zinc in 1746 . Work by Luigi Galvani and Alessandro Volta uncovered the electrochemical properties of zinc by 1800 . Corrosion-resistant zinc plating of iron ( hot-dip galvanizing ) is the major application for zinc . Other applications are in batteries , small non-structural castings , and alloys , such as brass . A variety of zinc compounds are commonly used , such as zinc carbonate and zinc gluconate ( as dietary supplements ) , zinc chloride ( in deodorants ) , zinc pyrithione ( anti-dandruff shampoos ) , zinc sulfide ( in luminescent paints ) , and zinc methyl or zinc diethyl in the organic laboratory .
Luther was the most widely read author of his generation , and within Germany he acquired the status of a prophet . According to the prevailing view among historians , his anti-Jewish rhetoric contributed significantly to the development of antisemitism in Germany , and in the 1930s and 1940s provided an " ideal underpinning " for the Nazis ' attacks on Jews . Reinhold Lewin writes that anybody who " wrote against the Jews for whatever reason believed he had the right to justify himself by triumphantly referring to Luther . " According to Michael , just about every anti-Jewish book printed in the Third Reich contained references to and quotations from Luther . Heinrich Himmler wrote admiringly of his writings and sermons on the Jews in 1940 . The city of Nuremberg presented a first edition of On the Jews and their Lies to Julius Streicher , editor of the Nazi newspaper Der Stürmer , on his birthday in 1937 ; the newspaper described it as the most radically anti-Semitic tract ever published . It was publicly exhibited in a glass case at the Nuremberg rallies and quoted in a 54-page explanation of the Aryan Law by Dr. E.H. Schulz and Dr. R. Frercks .
Luther 's writings circulated widely , reaching France , England , and Italy as early as 1519 . Students thronged to Wittenberg to hear Luther speak . He published a short commentary on Galatians and his Work on the Psalms . This early part of Luther 's career was one of his most creative and productive . Three of his best-known works were published in 1520 : To the Christian Nobility of the German Nation , On the Babylonian Captivity of the Church , and On the Freedom of a Christian .
Six-time Grammy winner and Academy Award nominee Lady Gaga performed the national anthem , while Academy Award winner Marlee Matlin provided American Sign Language ( ASL ) translation .
The Panthers used the San Jose State practice facility and stayed at the San Jose Marriott . The Broncos practiced at Stanford University and stayed at the Santa Clara Marriott .
The last ruler from the Ptolemaic line was Cleopatra VII , who committed suicide following the burial of her lover Mark Antony who had died in her arms ( from a self-inflicted stab wound ) , after Octavian had captured Alexandria and her mercenary forces had fled . The Ptolemies faced rebellions of native Egyptians often caused by an unwanted regime and were involved in foreign and civil wars that led to the decline of the kingdom and its annexation by Rome . Nevertheless , Hellenistic culture continued to thrive in Egypt well after the Muslim conquest .
Super Bowl 50 featured numerous records from individuals and teams . Denver won despite being massively outgained in total yards ( 315 to 194 ) and first downs ( 21 to 11 ) . Their 194 yards and 11 first downs were both the lowest totals ever by a Super Bowl winning team . The previous record was 244 yards by the Baltimore Ravens in Super Bowl XXXV . Only seven other teams had ever gained less than 200 yards in a Super Bowl , and all of them had lost . The Broncos ' seven sacks tied a Super Bowl record set by the Chicago Bears in Super Bowl XX . Kony Ealy tied a Super Bowl record with three sacks . Jordan Norwood 's 61-yard punt return set a new record , surpassing the old record of 45 yards set by John Taylor in Super Bowl XXIII . Denver was just 1-of-14 on third down , while Carolina was barely better at 3-of-15 . The two teams ' combined third down conversion percentage of 13.8 was a Super Bowl low . Manning and Newton had quarterback passer ratings of 56.6 and 55.4 , respectively , and their added total of 112 is a record lowest aggregate passer rating for a Super Bowl . Manning became the oldest quarterback ever to win a Super Bowl at age 39 , and the first quarterback ever to win a Super Bowl with two different teams , while Gary Kubiak became the first head coach to win a Super Bowl with the same franchise he went to the Super Bowl with as a player .
BSkyB 's direct-to-home satellite service became available in 10 million homes in 2010 , Europe 's first pay-TV platform in to achieve that milestone . Confirming it had reached its target , the broadcaster said its reach into 36 % of households in the UK represented an audience of more than 25m people . The target was first announced in August 2004 , since then an additional 2.4m customers had subscribed to BSkyB 's direct-to-home service . Media commentators had debated whether the figure could be reached as the growth in subscriber numbers elsewhere in Europe flattened .
His translation of the Bible into the vernacular ( instead of Latin ) made it more accessible , which had a tremendous impact on the church and German culture . It fostered the development of a standard version of the German language , added several principles to the art of translation , and influenced the writing of an English translation , the Tyndale Bible . His hymns influenced the development of singing in churches . His marriage to Katharina von Bora set a model for the practice of clerical marriage , allowing Protestant clergy to marry .
Like any plucked instrument , mandolin notes decay to silence rather than sound out continuously as with a bowed note on a violin , and mandolin notes decay faster than larger stringed instruments like the guitar . This encourages the use of tremolo ( rapid picking of one or more pairs of strings ) to create sustained notes or chords . The mandolin 's paired strings facilitate this technique : the plectrum ( pick ) strikes each of a pair of strings alternately , providing a more full and continuous sound than a single string would .
At various times , there have been cardinals who had only received first tonsure and minor orders but not yet been ordained as deacons or priests . Though clerics , they were inaccurately called " lay cardinals " and were permitted to marry . Teodolfo Mertel was among the last of the lay cardinals . When he died in 1899 he was the last surviving cardinal who was not at least ordained a priest . With the revision of the Code of Canon Law promulgated in 1917 by Pope Benedict XV , only those who are already priests or bishops may be appointed cardinals . Since the time of Pope John XXIII a priest who is appointed a cardinal must be consecrated a bishop , unless he obtains a dispensation .
Despite the disagreements on the Eucharist , the Marburg Colloquy paved the way for the signing in 1530 of the Augsburg Confession , and for the formation of the Schmalkaldic League the following year by leading Protestant nobles such as John of Saxony , Philip of Hesse , and George , Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach . The Swiss cities , however , did not sign these agreements .
Other scholars argue that , even if his views were merely anti-Judaic—that is , opposed to Judaism and its adherence rather than the Jews as an ethnic group—their violence lent a new element to the standard Christian suspicion of Judaism . Ronald Berger writes that Luther is credited with " Germanizing the Christian critique of Judaism and establishing anti-Semitism as a key element of German culture and national identity . " Paul Rose argues that he caused a " hysterical and demonizing mentality " about Jews to enter German thought and discourse , a mentality that might otherwise have been absent . Christopher J. Probst in his book Demonizing the Jews : Luther and the Protestant Church in Nazi Germany ( 2012 ) , shows that a large number of German Lutheran clergy and theologians during the Nazi Third Reich used Luther 's hostile publications towards the Jews and their Jewish religion to justify at least in part the anti-Semitic policies of the National Socialists .
In late November 2015 , reports surfaced stating that " multiple acts " would perform during the halftime show . On December 3 , the league confirmed that the show would be headlined by the British rock group Coldplay . On January 7 , 2016 , Pepsi confirmed to the Associated Press that Beyoncé , who headlined the Super Bowl XLVII halftime show and collaborated with Coldplay on the single " Hymn for the Weekend " , would be making an appearance . Bruno Mars , who headlined the Super Bowl XLVIII halftime show , and Mark Ronson also performed .
Hard rock entered the 1990s as one of the dominant forms of commercial music . The multi-platinum releases of AC/DC 's The Razors Edge ( 1990 ) , Guns N ' Roses ' Use Your Illusion I and Use Your Illusion II ( both in 1991 ) , Ozzy Osbourne 's No More Tears ( 1991 ) , and Van Halen 's For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge ( 1991 ) showcased this popularity . Additionally , The Black Crowes released their debut album , Shake Your Money Maker ( 1990 ) , which contained a bluesy classic rock sound and sold five million copies . In 1992 , Def Leppard followed up 1987 's Hysteria with Adrenalize , which went multi-platinum , spawned four Top 40 singles and held the number one spot on the US album chart for five weeks .
At the very end of the 19th century , a new style , with a carved top and back construction inspired by violin family instruments began to supplant the European-style bowl-back instruments in the United States . This new style is credited to mandolins designed and built by Orville Gibson , a Kalamazoo , Michigan luthier who founded the " Gibson Mandolin-Guitar Manufacturing Co. , Limited " in 1902 . Gibson mandolins evolved into two basic styles : the Florentine or F-style , which has a decorative scroll near the neck , two points on the lower body and usually a scroll carved into the headstock ; and the A-style , which is pear shaped , has no points and usually has a simpler headstock .
In early 1991 , non-Arabs of the Zaghawa tribe of Sudan attested that they were victims of an intensifying Arab apartheid campaign , segregating Arabs and non-Arabs ( specifically people of sub-Saharan African descent ) . Sudanese Arabs , who controlled the government , were widely referred to as practicing apartheid against Sudan 's non-Arab citizens . The government was accused of " deftly manipulat ( ing ) Arab solidarity " to carry out policies of apartheid and ethnic cleansing .
The game 's media day , which was typically held on the Tuesday afternoon prior to the game , was moved to the Monday evening and re-branded as Super Bowl Opening Night . The event was held on February 1 , 2016 at SAP Center in San Jose . Alongside the traditional media availabilities , the event featured an opening ceremony with player introductions on a replica of the Golden Gate Bridge .
As of 2000 [ update ] , there were 59,948 people who were single and never married in the municipality . There were 49,873 married individuals , 9,345 widows or widowers and 9,468 individuals who are divorced .
In 1516 , Johann Tetzel , a Dominican friar and papal commissioner for indulgences , was sent to Germany by the Roman Catholic Church to sell indulgences to raise money to rebuild St. Peter 's Basilica in Rome . Roman Catholic theology stated that faith alone , whether fiduciary or dogmatic , can not justify man ; justification rather depends only on such faith as is active in charity and good works ( fides caritate formata ) . The benefits of good works could be obtained by donating money to the church .
In 1353 Bern joined the Swiss Confederacy , becoming one of the eight cantons of the formative period of 1353 to 1481 . Bern invaded and conquered Aargau in 1415 and Vaud in 1536 , as well as other smaller territories ; thereby becoming the largest city-state north of the Alps , by the 18th century comprising most of what is today the canton of Bern and the canton of Vaud .
Some succeeded their fathers as rulers , such as Sultan Ahmad al-Mansur , who ruled Morocco from 1578 to 1608 . He was not technically considered as a mixed-race child of a slave ; his mother was Fulani and a concubine of his father . Such tolerance for black persons , even when technically " free " , was not so common in Morocco . The long association of sub-Saharan peoples as slaves is shown in the term abd ( Arabic : عبد‎ , ) ( meaning " slave " ) ; it is still frequently used in the Arabic-speaking world as a term for black people .
CBS set the base rate for a 30-second advertisement at $ 5,000,000 , a record high price for a Super Bowl ad . As of January 26 , the advertisements had not yet sold out . CBS mandated that all advertisers purchase a package covering time on both the television and digital broadcasts of the game , meaning that for the first time , digital streams of the game would carry all national advertising in pattern with the television broadcast . This would be the final year in a multi-year contract with Anheuser-Busch InBev that allowed the beer manufacturer to air multiple advertisements during the game at a steep discount . It was also the final year that Doritos , a longtime sponsor of the game , held its " Crash the Super Bowl " contest that allowed viewers to create their own Doritos ads for a chance to have it aired during the game . Nintendo and The Pokémon Company also made their Super Bowl debut , promoting the 20th anniversary of the Pokémon video game and media franchise .
In the autumn of 1991 , talks were held for the broadcast rights for Premier League for a five-year period , from the 1992 season . ITV were the current rights holders , and fought hard to retain the new rights . ITV had increased its offer from £18m to £34m per year to keep control of the rights . BSkyB joined forces with the BBC to make a counter bid . The BBC was given the highlights of most of the matches , while BSkyB paying £304m for the Premier League rights , would give them a monopoly of all live matches , up to 60 per year from the 1992 season . Murdoch described sport as a " battering ram " for pay-television , providing a strong customer base . A few weeks after the deal , ITV went to the High Court to get an injunction as it believed their bid details had been leaked before the decision was taken . ITV also asked the Office of Fair Trading to investigate since it believed Rupert Murdoch 's media empire via its newspapers had influenced the deal . A few days later neither action took effect , ITV believed BSkyB was telephoned and informed of its £262m bid , and Premier League advised BSkyB to increase its counter bid .
As the designated home team in the annual rotation between AFC and NFC teams , the Broncos elected to wear their road white jerseys with matching white pants . Elway stated , " We 've had Super Bowl success in our white uniforms . " The Broncos last wore matching white jerseys and pants in the Super Bowl in Super Bowl XXXIII , Elway 's last game as Denver QB , when they defeated the Atlanta Falcons 34–19 . In their only other Super Bowl win in Super Bowl XXXII , Denver wore blue jerseys , which was their primary color at the time . They also lost Super Bowl XXI when they wore white jerseys , but they are 0-4 in Super Bowls when wearing orange jerseys , losing in Super Bowl XII , XXII , XXIV , and XLVIII . The only other AFC champion team to have worn white as the designated home team in the Super Bowl was the Pittsburgh Steelers ; they defeated the Seattle Seahawks 21–10 in Super Bowl XL 10 seasons prior . The Broncos ' decision to wear white meant the Panthers would wear their standard home uniform : black jerseys with silver pants .
In 1521 Luther dealt largely with prophecy , in which he broadened the foundations of the Reformation placing them on prophetic faith . His main interest was centered on the prophecy of the Little Horn in Daniel 8:9–12 , 23–25 . The antichrist of 2 Thessalonians 2 was identified as the power of the Papacy . So too was the Little Horn of Daniel 7 , coming up among the divisions of Rome , explicitly applied .
In 1978 Aboriginal writer Kevin Gilbert received the National Book Council award for his book Living Black : Blacks Talk to Kevin Gilbert , a collection of Aboriginal people 's stories , and in 1998 was awarded ( but refused to accept ) the Human Rights Award for Literature for Inside Black Australia , a poetry anthology and exhibition of Aboriginal photography . In contrast to previous definitions based solely on the degree of Aboriginal ancestry , in 1990 the Government changed the legal definition of Aboriginal to include any :
There are many styles of mandolin , but four are common , the Neapolitan or round-backed mandolin , the carved-top mandolin and the flat-backed mandolin . The round-back has a deep bottom , constructed of strips of wood , glued together into a bowl . The carved-top or arch-top mandolin has a much shallower , arched back , and an arched top—both carved out of wood . The flat-backed mandolin uses thin sheets of wood for the body , braced on the inside for strength in a similar manner to a guitar . Each style of instrument has its own sound quality and is associated with particular forms of music . Neapolitan mandolins feature prominently in European classical music and traditional music . Carved-top instruments are common in American folk music and bluegrass music . Flat-backed instruments are commonly used in Irish , British and Brazilian folk music . Some modern Brazilian instruments feature an extra fifth course tuned a fifth lower than the standard fourth course .
Because of the acceptance of miscegenation , Brazil has avoided the binary polarization of society into black and white . In addition , it abolished slavery without a civil war . The bitter and sometimes violent racial tensions that have divided the US are notably absent in Brazil . According to the 2010 census , 6.7 % of Brazilians said they were black , compared with 6.2 % in 2000 , and 43.1 % said they were racially mixed , up from 38.5 % . In 2010 , Elio Ferreira de Araujo , Brazil 's minister for racial equality , attributed the increases to growing pride among his country 's black and indigenous communities .
In 2000 [ update ] , there were 94,367 workers who commuted into the municipality and 16,424 workers who commuted away . The municipality is a net importer of workers , with about 5.7 workers entering the municipality for every one leaving . Of the working population , 50.6 % used public transport to get to work , and 20.6 % used a private car .
In addition , there are $ 2 million worth of other ancillary events , including a week-long event at the Santa Clara Convention Center , a beer , wine and food festival at Bellomy Field at Santa Clara University , and a pep rally . A professional fundraiser will aid in finding business sponsors and individual donors , but still may need the city council to help fund the event . Additional funding will be provided by the city council , which has announced plans to set aside seed funding for the event .
Egyptian President Anwar Sadat had a mother who was a dark-skinned Nubian Sudanese woman and a father who was a lighter-skinned Egyptian . In response to an advertisement for an acting position , as a young man he said , " I am not white but I am not exactly black either . My blackness is tending to reddish " .
In the United States , macabre-rock pioneer Alice Cooper achieved mainstream success with the top ten album School 's Out ( 1972 ) . In the following year blues rockers ZZ Top released their classic album Tres Hombres and Aerosmith produced their eponymous début , as did Southern rockers Lynyrd Skynyrd and proto-punk outfit New York Dolls , demonstrating the diverse directions being pursued in the genre . Montrose , including the instrumental talent of Ronnie Montrose and vocals of Sammy Hagar and arguably the first all American hard rock band to challenge the British dominance of the genre , released their first album in 1973 . Kiss built on the theatrics of Alice Cooper and the look of the New York Dolls to produce a unique band persona , achieving their commercial breakthrough with the double live album Alive ! in 1975 and helping to take hard rock into the stadium rock era . In the mid-1970s Aerosmith achieved their commercial and artistic breakthrough with Toys in the Attic ( 1975 ) , which reached number 11 in the American album chart , and Rocks ( 1976 ) , which peaked at number three . Blue Öyster Cult , formed in the late 60s , picked up on some of the elements introduced by Black Sabbath with their breakthrough live gold album On Your Feet or on Your Knees ( 1975 ) , followed by their first platinum album , Agents of Fortune ( 1976 ) , containing the hit single " ( Do n't Fear ) The Reaper " , which reached number 12 on the Billboard charts . Journey released their eponymous debut in 1975 and the next year Boston released their highly successful début album . In the same year , hard rock bands featuring women saw commercial success as Heart released Dreamboat Annie and The Runaways débuted with their self-titled album . While Heart had a more folk-oriented hard rock sound , the Runaways leaned more towards a mix of punk-influenced music and hard rock . The Amboy Dukes , having emerged from the Detroit garage rock scene and most famous for their Top 20 psychedelic hit " Journey to the Center of the Mind " ( 1968 ) , were dissolved by their guitarist Ted Nugent , who embarked on a solo career that resulted in four successive multi-platinum albums between Ted Nugent ( 1975 ) and his best selling Double Live Gonzo ( 1978 ) .
Zinc serves a purely structural role in zinc fingers , twists and clusters . Zinc fingers form parts of some transcription factors , which are proteins that recognize DNA base sequences during the replication and transcription of DNA . Each of the nine or ten Zn2+ ions in a zinc finger helps maintain the finger 's structure by coordinately binding to four amino acids in the transcription factor . The transcription factor wraps around the DNA helix and uses its fingers to accurately bind to the DNA sequence .
The Broncos ' defense ranked first in the NFL yards allowed ( 4,530 ) for the first time in franchise history , and fourth in points allowed ( 296 ) . Defensive ends Derek Wolfe and Malik Jackson each had 5½ sacks . Pro Bowl linebacker Von Miller led the team with 11 sacks , forced four fumbles , and recovered three . Linebacker DeMarcus Ware was selected to play in the Pro Bowl for the ninth time in his career , ranking second on the team with 7½ sacks . Linebacker Brandon Marshall led the team in total tackles with 109 , while Danny Trevathan ranked second with 102 . Cornerbacks Aqib Talib ( three interceptions ) and Chris Harris , Jr. ( two interceptions ) were the other two Pro Bowl selections from the defense .
At Maecenas ' insistence ( according to the tradition ) Virgil spent the ensuing years ( perhaps 37–29 BC ) on the long didactic hexameter poem called the Georgics ( from Greek , " On Working the Earth " ) which he dedicated to Maecenas . The ostensible theme of the Georgics is instruction in the methods of running a farm . In handling this theme , Virgil follows in the didactic ( " how to " ) tradition of the Greek poet Hesiod 's Works and Days and several works of the later Hellenistic poets . The four books of the Georgics focus respectively on raising crops and trees ( 1 and 2 ) , livestock and horses ( 3 ) , and beekeeping and the qualities of bees ( 4 ) . Well-known passages include the beloved Laus Italiae of Book 2 , the prologue description of the temple in Book 3 , and the description of the plague at the end of Book 3 . Book 4 concludes with a long mythological narrative , in the form of an epyllion which describes vividly the discovery of beekeeping by Aristaeus and the story of Orpheus ' journey to the underworld . Ancient scholars , such as Servius , conjectured that the Aristaeus episode replaced , at the emperor 's request , a long section in praise of Virgil 's friend , the poet Gallus , who was disgraced by Augustus , and who committed suicide in 26 BC .
Many people gain a sense of positive self-esteem from their identity groups , which furthers a sense of community and belonging . Another issue that researchers have attempted to address is the question of why people engage in discrimination , i.e. , why they tend to favor those they consider a part of their " in-group " over those considered to be outsiders . Both questions have been given extensive attention by researchers working in the social identity tradition . For example , in work relating to social identity theory it has been shown that merely crafting cognitive distinction between in- and out-groups can lead to subtle effects on people 's evaluations of others ( Cote & Levine 2002 ) .
With 4:51 left in regulation , Carolina got the ball on their own 24-yard line with a chance to mount a game-winning drive , and soon faced 3rd-and-9 . On the next play , Miller stripped the ball away from Newton , and after several players dove for it , it took a long bounce backwards and was recovered by Ward , who returned it five yards to the Panthers 4-yard line . Although several players dove into the pile to attempt to recover it , Newton did not and his lack of aggression later earned him heavy criticism . Meanwhile , Denver 's offense was kept out of the end zone for three plays , but a holding penalty on cornerback Josh Norman gave the Broncos a new set of downs . Then Anderson scored on a 2-yard touchdown run and Manning completed a pass to Bennie Fowler for a 2-point conversion , giving Denver a 24–10 lead with 3:08 left and essentially putting the game away . Carolina had two more drives , but failed to get a first down on each one .
The city of Bern or Berne ( German : Bern , pronounced [ bɛrn ] ( listen ) ; French : Berne [ bɛʁn ] ; Italian : Berna [ ˈbɛrna ] ; Romansh : Berna [ ˈbɛrnɐ ] ( help·info ) ; Bernese German : Bärn [ b̥æːrn ] ) is the de facto capital of Switzerland , referred to by the Swiss as their ( e.g . in German ) Bundesstadt , or " federal city " . [ note 1 ] With a population of 140,634 ( November 2015 ) , Bern is the fifth most populous city in Switzerland . The Bern agglomeration , which includes 36 municipalities , had a population of 406,900 in 2014 . The metropolitan area had a population of 660,000 in 2000 . Bern is also the capital of the Canton of Bern , the second most populous of Switzerland 's cantons .
In 1986 , CBS sold its music publishing arm , CBS Songs , to Stephen Swid , Martin Bandier , and Charles Koppelman for $ 125 million making it the foundation of their SBK Entertainment .
The catechism is one of Luther 's most personal works . " Regarding the plan to collect my writings in volumes , " he wrote , " I am quite cool and not at all eager about it because , roused by a Saturnian hunger , I would rather see them all devoured . For I acknowledge none of them to be really a book of mine , except perhaps the Bondage of the Will and the Catechism . " The Small Catechism has earned a reputation as a model of clear religious teaching . It remains in use today , along with Luther 's hymns and his translation of the Bible .
According to the Office for National Statistics , at the 2001 census there were over a million black people in the United Kingdom ; 1 % of the total population described themselves as " Black Caribbean " , 0.8 % as " Black African " , and 0.2 % as " Black other " . Britain encouraged the immigration of workers from the Caribbean after World War II ; the first symbolic movement was those who came on the ship the Empire Windrush . The preferred official umbrella term is " black and minority ethnic " ( BME ) , but sometimes the term " black " is used on its own , to express unified opposition to racism , as in the Southall Black Sisters , which started with a mainly British Asian constituency , and the National Black Police Association , which has a membership of " African , African-Caribbean and Asian origin " .
UNFPA is the world 's largest multilateral source of funding for population and reproductive health programs . The Fund works with governments and non-governmental organizations in over 150 countries with the support of the international community , supporting programs that help women , men and young people :
Noteworthy Irish mandolinists include Andy Irvine ( who , like Johnny Moynihan , almost always tunes the top E down to D , to achieve an open tuning of GDAD ) , Paul Brady , Mick Moloney , Paul Kelly and Claudine Langille . John Sheahan and the late Barney McKenna , respectively fiddle player and tenor banjo player with The Dubliners , are also accomplished Irish mandolin players . The instruments used are either flat-backed , oval hole examples as described above ( made by UK luthier Roger Bucknall of Fylde Guitars ) , or carved-top , oval hole instruments with arched back ( made by Stefan Sobell in Northumberland ) . The Irish guitarist Rory Gallagher often played the mandolin on stage , and he most famously used it in the song " Going To My Hometown . "

The negotiations were successfully concluded on 17 February 1546 . After 8 a.m. , he experienced chest pains . When he went to his bed , he prayed , " Into your hand I commit my spirit ; you have redeemed me , O Lord , faithful God " ( Ps . 31:5 ) , the common prayer of the dying . At 1 a.m. he awoke with more chest pain and was warmed with hot towels . He thanked God for revealing his Son to him in whom he had believed . His companions , Justus Jonas and Michael Coelius , shouted loudly , " Reverend father , are you ready to die trusting in your Lord Jesus Christ and to confess the doctrine which you have taught in his name ? " A distinct " Yes " was Luther 's reply .
Columbia founded Epic Records in 1953 . In 1956 , Conkling left Columbia , he would help establish the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences before eventually becoming the first president of the newly launched Warner Bros. Records , and Goddard Lieberson began the first of two stints as head of the record company . In 1958 , Columbia founded another label , Date Records , which initially issued rockabilly music .
The First Intermediate Period ushered in a time of political upheaval for about 150 years . Stronger Nile floods and stabilisation of government , however , brought back renewed prosperity for the country in the Middle Kingdom c. 2040 BC , reaching a peak during the reign of Pharaoh Amenemhat III . A second period of disunity heralded the arrival of the first foreign ruling dynasty in Egypt , that of the Semitic Hyksos . The Hyksos invaders took over much of Lower Egypt around 1650 BC and founded a new capital at Avaris . They were driven out by an Upper Egyptian force led by Ahmose I , who founded the Eighteenth Dynasty and relocated the capital from Memphis to Thebes .
Denver took the opening kickoff and started out strong with Peyton Manning completing an 18-yard pass to tight end Owen Daniels and a 22-yard throw to receiver Andre Caldwell . A pair of carries by C. J. Anderson moved the ball up 20 yards to the Panthers 14-yard line , but Carolina 's defense dug in over the next three plays . First , linebacker Shaq Thompson tackled Ronnie Hillman for a 3-yard loss . Then after an incompletion , Thomas Davis tackled Anderson for a 1-yard gain on third down , forcing Denver to settle for a 3–0 lead on a Brandon McManus 34-yard field goal . The score marked the first time in the entire postseason that Carolina was facing a deficit .
The doctrine of the immaculate conception ( Mary being conceived free from original sin ) is not to be confused with her virginal conception of her son Jesus . This misunderstanding of the term immaculate conception is frequently met in the mass media . Catholics believe that Mary was not the product of a virginal conception herself but was the daughter of a human father and mother , traditionally known by the names of Saint Joachim and Saint Anne . In 1677 , the Holy See condemned the belief that Mary was virginally conceived , which had been a belief surfacing occasionally since the 4th century . The Church celebrates the Feast of the Immaculate Conception ( when Mary was conceived free from original sin ) on 8 December , exactly nine months before celebrating the Nativity of Mary . The feast of the Annunciation ( which commemorates the virginal conception and the Incarnation of Jesus ) is celebrated on 25 March , nine months before Christmas Day .
Scholars disagree over the effects of social status on racial classifications in Brazil . It is generally believed that achieving upward mobility and education results in individuals being classified as a category of lighter skin . The popular claim is that in Brazil , poor whites are considered black and wealthy blacks are considered white . Some scholars disagree , arguing that " whitening " of one 's social status may be open to people of mixed race , a large part of the population known as pardo , but a person perceived as preto ( black ) will continue to be classified as black regardless of wealth or social status .
Since the 1980s , Lutheran Church denominations have repudiated Martin Luther 's statements against the Jews and have rejected the use of them to incite hatred against Lutherans . Strommen et al . 's 1970 survey of 4,745 North American Lutherans aged 15–65 found that , compared to the other minority groups under consideration , Lutherans were the least prejudiced toward Jews . Nevertheless , Professor Richard ( Dick ) Geary , former Professor of Modern History at the University of Nottingham , England , and the author of Hitler and Nazism ( Routledge 1993 ) , wrote in the journal History Today an article on who voted for the Nazis in elections held from 1928-1933 , where he claimed that from his research he found that the Nazis gained disproportionately more votes from Protestant than Catholic areas of Germany .
Peyton Manning became the first quarterback ever to lead two different teams to multiple Super Bowls . He is also the oldest quarterback ever to play in a Super Bowl at age 39 . The past record was held by John Elway , who led the Broncos to victory in Super Bowl XXXIII at age 38 and is currently Denver 's Executive Vice President of Football Operations and General Manager .
As the designated home team in the annual rotation between AFC and NFC teams , the Broncos elected to wear their road white jerseys with matching white pants . Elway stated , " We 've had Super Bowl success in our white uniforms . " The Broncos last wore matching white jerseys and pants in the Super Bowl in Super Bowl XXXIII , Elway 's last game as Denver QB , when they defeated the Atlanta Falcons 34–19 . In their only other Super Bowl win in Super Bowl XXXII , Denver wore blue jerseys , which was their primary color at the time . They also lost Super Bowl XXI when they wore white jerseys , but they are 0-4 in Super Bowls when wearing orange jerseys , losing in Super Bowl XII , XXII , XXIV , and XLVIII . The only other AFC champion team to have worn white as the designated home team in the Super Bowl was the Pittsburgh Steelers ; they defeated the Seattle Seahawks 21–10 in Super Bowl XL 10 seasons prior . The Broncos ' decision to wear white meant the Panthers would wear their standard home uniform : black jerseys with silver pants .
The Panthers used the San Jose State practice facility and stayed at the San Jose Marriott . The Broncos practiced at Stanford University and stayed at the Santa Clara Marriott .
Gender identity forms an important part of identity in psychology , as it dictates to a significant degree how one views oneself both as a person and in relation to other people , ideas and nature . Other aspects of identity , such as racial , religious , ethnic , occupational… etc . may also be more or less significant – or significant in some situations but not in others ( Weinreich & Saunderson 2003 pp26–34 ) . In cognitive psychology , the term " identity " refers to the capacity for self-reflection and the awareness of self . ( Leary & Tangney 2003 , p. 3 )
His poor physical health made him short-tempered and even harsher in his writings and comments . His wife Katharina was overheard saying , " Dear husband , you are too rude , " and he responded , " They are teaching me to be rude . " In 1545 and 1546 Luther preached three times in the Market Church in Halle , staying with his friend Justus Jonas during Christmas .
In the summer of 1521 , Luther widened his target from individual pieties like indulgences and pilgrimages to doctrines at the heart of Church practices . In On the Abrogation of the Private Mass , he condemned as idolatry the idea that the mass is a sacrifice , asserting instead that it is a gift , to be received with thanksgiving by the whole congregation . His essay On Confession , Whether the Pope has the Power to Require It rejected compulsory confession and encouraged private confession and absolution , since " every Christian is a confessor . " In November , Luther wrote The Judgement of Martin Luther on Monastic Vows . He assured monks and nuns that they could break their vows without sin , because vows were an illegitimate and vain attempt to win salvation .
Despite the disagreements on the Eucharist , the Marburg Colloquy paved the way for the signing in 1530 of the Augsburg Confession , and for the formation of the Schmalkaldic League the following year by leading Protestant nobles such as John of Saxony , Philip of Hesse , and George , Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach . The Swiss cities , however , did not sign these agreements .
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) has stated that zinc damages nerve receptors in the nose , which can cause anosmia . Reports of anosmia were also observed in the 1930s when zinc preparations were used in a failed attempt to prevent polio infections . On June 16 , 2009 , the FDA said that consumers should stop using zinc-based intranasal cold products and ordered their removal from store shelves . The FDA said the loss of smell can be life-threatening because people with impaired smell can not detect leaking gas or smoke and can not tell if food has spoiled before they eat it . Recent research suggests that the topical antimicrobial zinc pyrithione is a potent heat shock response inducer that may impair genomic integrity with induction of PARP-dependent energy crisis in cultured human keratinocytes and melanocytes .
In Anglo-American academic political philosophy , the publication of John Rawls 's A Theory of Justice in 1971 is considered a milestone . Rawls used a thought experiment , the original position , in which representative parties choose principles of justice for the basic structure of society from behind a veil of ignorance . Rawls also offered a criticism of utilitarian approaches to questions of political justice . Robert Nozick 's 1974 book Anarchy , State , and Utopia , which won a National Book Award , responded to Rawls from a libertarian perspective and gained academic respectability for libertarian viewpoints .
After each team punted , Panthers quarterback Cam Newton appeared to complete a 24-yard pass Jerricho Cotchery , but the call was ruled an incompletion and upheld after a replay challenge . CBS analyst and retired referee Mike Carey stated he disagreed with the call and felt the review clearly showed the pass was complete . A few plays later , on 3rd-and-10 from the 15-yard line , linebacker Von Miller knocked the ball out of Newton 's hands while sacking him , and Malik Jackson recovered it in the end zone for a Broncos touchdown , giving the team a 10–0 lead . This was the first fumble return touchdown in a Super Bowl since Super Bowl XXVIII at the end of the 1993 season .
In 1983 the historic old town in the centre of Bern became a UNESCO World Heritage Site . Bern is ranked among the world ’ s top ten cities for the best quality of life ( 2010 ) .
Luther made his pronouncements from Wartburg in the context of rapid developments at Wittenberg , of which he was kept fully informed . Andreas Karlstadt , supported by the ex-Augustinian Gabriel Zwilling , embarked on a radical programme of reform there in June 1521 , exceeding anything envisaged by Luther . The reforms provoked disturbances , including a revolt by the Augustinian friars against their prior , the smashing of statues and images in churches , and denunciations of the magistracy . After secretly visiting Wittenberg in early December 1521 , Luther wrote A Sincere Admonition by Martin Luther to All Christians to Guard Against Insurrection and Rebellion . Wittenberg became even more volatile after Christmas when a band of visionary zealots , the so-called Zwickau prophets , arrived , preaching revolutionary doctrines such as the equality of man , adult baptism , and Christ 's imminent return . When the town council asked Luther to return , he decided it was his duty to act .
QuickBooks sponsored a " Small Business Big Game " contest , in which Death Wish Coffee had a 30-second commercial aired free of charge courtesy of QuickBooks . Death Wish Coffee beat out nine other contenders from across the United States for the free advertisement .
In contrast to the views of John Calvin and Philipp Melanchthon , throughout his life Luther maintained that it was not false doctrine to believe that a Christian 's soul sleeps after it is separated from the body in death ; and , accordingly , he disputed traditional interpretations of some Bible passages , such as the parable of the rich man and Lazarus . This also led Luther to reject the idea of torments for the saints : " It is enough for us to know that souls do not leave their bodies to be threatened by the torments and punishments of hell , but enter a prepared bedchamber in which they sleep in peace . " He also rejected the existence of Purgatory , which involved Christian souls undergoing penitential suffering after death . He affirmed the continuity of one 's personal identity beyond death . In his Smalcald Articles , he described the saints as currently residing " in their graves and in heaven . "
Several dozen radioisotopes have been characterized . 65Zn , which has a half-life of 243.66 days , is the most long-lived radioisotope , followed by 72Zn with a half-life of 46.5 hours . Zinc has 10 nuclear isomers . 69mZn has the longest half-life , 13.76 h. The superscript m indicates a metastable isotope . The nucleus of a metastable isotope is in an excited state and will return to the ground state by emitting a photon in the form of a gamma ray . 61Zn has three excited states and 73Zn has two . The isotopes 65Zn , 71Zn , 77Zn and 78Zn each have only one excited state .

In 1958 , Egypt and Syria formed a sovereign union known as the United Arab Republic . The union was short-lived , ending in 1961 when Syria seceded , thus ending the union . During most of its existence , the United Arab Republic was also in a loose confederation with North Yemen ( or the Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen ) , known as the United Arab States . In 1959 , the All-Palestine Government of the Gaza Strip , an Egyptian client state , was absorbed into the United Arab Republic under the pretext of Arab union , and was never restored .
Super Bowl 50 featured numerous records from individuals and teams . Denver won despite being massively outgained in total yards ( 315 to 194 ) and first downs ( 21 to 11 ) . Their 194 yards and 11 first downs were both the lowest totals ever by a Super Bowl winning team . The previous record was 244 yards by the Baltimore Ravens in Super Bowl XXXV . Only seven other teams had ever gained less than 200 yards in a Super Bowl , and all of them had lost . The Broncos ' seven sacks tied a Super Bowl record set by the Chicago Bears in Super Bowl XX . Kony Ealy tied a Super Bowl record with three sacks . Jordan Norwood 's 61-yard punt return set a new record , surpassing the old record of 45 yards set by John Taylor in Super Bowl XXIII . Denver was just 1-of-14 on third down , while Carolina was barely better at 3-of-15 . The two teams ' combined third down conversion percentage of 13.8 was a Super Bowl low . Manning and Newton had quarterback passer ratings of 56.6 and 55.4 , respectively , and their added total of 112 is a record lowest aggregate passer rating for a Super Bowl . Manning became the oldest quarterback ever to win a Super Bowl at age 39 , and the first quarterback ever to win a Super Bowl with two different teams , while Gary Kubiak became the first head coach to win a Super Bowl with the same franchise he went to the Super Bowl with as a player .
On June 4 , 2014 , the NFL announced that the practice of branding Super Bowl games with Roman numerals , a practice established at Super Bowl V , would be temporarily suspended , and that the game would be named using Arabic numerals as Super Bowl 50 as opposed to Super Bowl L. The use of Roman numerals will be reinstated for Super Bowl LI . Jaime Weston , the league 's vice president of brand and creative , explained that a primary reason for the change was the difficulty of designing an aesthetically pleasing logo with the letter " L " using the standardized logo template introduced at Super Bowl XLV . The logo also deviates from the template by featuring large numerals , colored in gold , behind the Vince Lombardi Trophy , instead of underneath and in silver as in the standard logo .
Zinc is an essential mineral perceived by the public today as being of " exceptional biologic and public health importance " , especially regarding prenatal and postnatal development . Zinc deficiency affects about two billion people in the developing world and is associated with many diseases . In children it causes growth retardation , delayed sexual maturation , infection susceptibility , and diarrhea . Enzymes with a zinc atom in the reactive center are widespread in biochemistry , such as alcohol dehydrogenase in humans . Consumption of excess zinc can cause ataxia , lethargy and copper deficiency .
Egypt has one of the oldest civilisations in the world . It has been in contact with many other civilisations and nations and has been through so many eras , starting from prehistoric age to the modern age , passing through so many ages such as ; Pharonic , Roman , Greek , Islamic and many other ages . Because of this wide variation of ages , the continuous contact with other nations and the big number of conflicts Egypt had been through , at least 60 museums may be found in Egypt , mainly covering a wide area of these ages and conflicts .
The bandolim ( Portuguese for " mandolin " ) was a favourite instrument within the Portuguese bourgeoisie of the 19th century , but its rapid spread took it to other places , joining other instruments . Today you can see mandolins as part of the traditional and folk culture of Portuguese singing groups and the majority of the mandolin scene in Portugal is in Madeira Island . Madeira has over 17 active mandolin Orchestras and Tunas . The mandolin virtuoso Fabio Machado is one of Portugal 's most accomplished mandolin players . The Portuguese influence brought the mandolin to Brazil .
Following a lengthy legal battle with the European Commission , which deemed the exclusivity of the rights to be against the interests of competition and the consumer , BSkyB 's monopoly came to an end from the 2007–08 season . In May 2006 , the Irish broadcaster Setanta Sports was awarded two of the six Premier League packages that the English FA offered to broadcasters . Sky picked up the remaining four for £1.3bn . In February 2015 , Sky bid £4.2bn for a package of 120 premier league games across the three seasons from 2016 . This represented an increase of 70 % on the previous contract and was said to be £1bn more than the company had expected to pay . The move has been followed by staff cuts , increased subscription prices ( including 9 % in Sky 's family package ) and the dropping of the 3D channel .
There is confusion currently as to the name of the eldest Vinaccia luthier who first ran the shop . His name has been put forth as Gennaro Vinaccia ( active c. 1710 to c. 1788 ) and Nic . Vinaccia . His son Antonio Vinaccia was active c. 1734 to c. 1796 . An early extant example of a mandolin is one built by Antonio Vinaccia in 1759 , which resides at the University of Edinburgh . Another is by Giuseppe Vinaccia , built in 1893 , is also at the University of Edinburgh . The earliest extant mandolin was built in 1744 by Antonio 's son , Gaetano Vinaccia . It resides in the Conservatoire Royal de Musique in Brussels , Belgium .

In the year 1563 the influential Ecumenical Council of Trent , headed by Pope Pius IV , wrote about the importance of selecting good Cardinals . According to this historic council " nothing is more necessary to the Church of God than that the holy Roman pontiff apply that solicitude which by the duty of his office he owes the universal Church in a very special way by associating with himself as cardinals the most select persons only , and appoint to each church most eminently upright and competent shepherds ; and this the more so , because our Lord Jesus Christ will require at his hands the blood of the sheep of Christ that perish through the evil government of shepherds who are negligent and forgetful of their office . "
Though Brazilians of at least partial African heritage make up a large percentage of the population , few blacks have been elected as politicians . The city of Salvador , Bahia , for instance , is 80 % people of color , but voters have not elected a mayor of color . Journalists like to say that US cities with black majorities , such as Detroit and New Orleans , have not elected white mayors since after the civil rights movement , when the Voting Rights Act of 1965 protected the franchise for minorities , and blacks in the South regained the power to vote for the first time since the turn of the 20th century . New Orleans elected its first black mayor in the 1970s . New Orleans elected a white mayor after the widescale disruption and damage of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 .
The mandolin 's popularity in the United States was spurred by the success of a group of touring young European musicians known as the Estudiantina Figaro , or in the United States , simply the " Spanish Students . " The group landed in the U.S. on January 2 , 1880 in New York City , and played in Boston and New York to wildly enthusiastic crowds . Ironically , this ensemble did not play mandolins but rather bandurrias , which are also small , double-strung instruments that resemble the mandolin . The success of the Figaro Spanish Students spawned other groups who imitated their musical style and costumes . An Italian musician , Carlo Curti , hastily started a musical ensemble after seeing the Figaro Spanish Students perform ; his group of Italian born Americans called themselves the " Original Spanish Students , " counting on the American public to not know the difference between the Spanish bandurrias and Italian mandolins . The imitators ' use of mandolins helped to generate enormous public interest in an instrument previously relatively unknown in the United States .
Luther spoke out against the Jews in Saxony , Brandenburg , and Silesia . Josel of Rosheim , the Jewish spokesman who tried to help the Jews of Saxony in 1537 , later blamed their plight on " that priest whose name was Martin Luther—may his body and soul be bound up in hell ! —who wrote and issued many heretical books in which he said that whoever would help the Jews was doomed to perdition . " Josel asked the city of Strasbourg to forbid the sale of Luther 's anti-Jewish works : they refused initially , but did so when a Lutheran pastor in Hochfelden used a sermon to urge his parishioners to murder Jews . Luther 's influence persisted after his death . Throughout the 1580s , riots led to the expulsion of Jews from several German Lutheran states .
In the Ottoman Empire , these ideological reforms did not take place and these views did not integrate into common thought until much later . As well , there was no spread of this doctrine within the New World and the advanced civilizations of the Aztec , Maya , Inca , Mohican , Delaware , Huron and especially the Iroquois . The Iroquois philosophy in particular gave much to Christian thought of the time and in many cases actually inspired some of the institutions adopted in the United States : for example , Benjamin Franklin was a great admirer of some of the methods of the Iroquois Confederacy , and much of early American literature emphasized the political philosophy of the natives .
The Panthers beat the Seattle Seahawks in the divisional round , running up a 31–0 halftime lead and then holding off a furious second half comeback attempt to win 31–24 , avenging their elimination from a year earlier . The Panthers then blew out the Arizona Cardinals in the NFC Championship Game , 49–15 , racking up 487 yards and forcing seven turnovers .
Following their loss in the divisional round of the previous season 's playoffs , the Denver Broncos underwent numerous coaching changes , including a mutual parting with head coach John Fox ( who had won four divisional championships in his four years as Broncos head coach ) , and the hiring of Gary Kubiak as the new head coach . Under Kubiak , the Broncos planned to install a run-oriented offense with zone blocking to blend in with quarterback Peyton Manning 's shotgun passing skills , but struggled with numerous changes and injuries to the offensive line , as well as Manning having his worst statistical season since his rookie year with the Indianapolis Colts in 1998 , due to a plantar fasciitis injury in his heel that he had suffered since the summer , and the simple fact that Manning was getting old , as he turned 39 in the 2015 off-season . Although the team had a 7–0 start , Manning led the NFL in interceptions . In week 10 , Manning suffered a partial tear of the plantar fasciitis in his left foot . He set the NFL 's all-time record for career passing yards in this game , but was benched after throwing four interceptions in favor of backup quarterback Brock Osweiler , who took over as the starter for most of the remainder of the regular season . Osweiler was injured , however , leading to Manning 's return during the Week 17 regular season finale , where the Broncos were losing 13–7 against the 4–11 San Diego Chargers , resulting in Manning re-claiming the starting quarterback position for the playoffs by leading the team to a key 27–20 win that enabled the team to clinch the number one overall AFC seed . Under defensive coordinator Wade Phillips , the Broncos ' defense ranked number one in total yards allowed , passing yards allowed and sacks , and like the previous three seasons , the team has continued to set numerous individual , league and franchise records . With the defense carrying the team despite the issues with the offense , the Broncos finished the regular season with a 12–4 record and earned home-field advantage throughout the AFC playoffs .

These styles generally have either two f-shaped soundholes like a violin ( F-5 and A-5 ) , or an oval sound hole ( F-4 and A-4 and lower models ) directly under the strings . Much variation exists between makers working from these archetypes , and other variants have become increasingly common . Generally , in the United States , Gibson F-hole F-5 mandolins and mandolins influenced by that design are strongly associated with bluegrass , while the A-style is associated other types of music , although it too is most often used for and associated with bluegrass . The F-5 's more complicated woodwork also translates into a more expensive instrument .
Often categorised with the New Wave of British Heavy Metal , in 1981 Def Leppard released their second album High 'n ' Dry , mixing glam-rock with heavy metal , and helping to define the sound of hard rock for the decade . The follow-up Pyromania ( 1983 ) , reached number two on the American charts and the singles " Photograph " , " Rock of Ages " and " Foolin ' " , helped by the emergence of MTV , all reached the Top 40 . It was widely emulated , particularly by the emerging Californian glam metal scene . This was followed by US acts like Mötley Crüe , with their albums Too Fast for Love ( 1981 ) and Shout at the Devil ( 1983 ) and , as the style grew , the arrival of bands such as Ratt , White Lion , Twisted Sister and Quiet Riot . Quiet Riot 's album Metal Health ( 1983 ) was the first glam metal album , and arguably the first heavy metal album of any kind , to reach number one in the Billboard music charts and helped open the doors for mainstream success by subsequent bands .
In America , nonprofit organizations like Friends of UNFPA ( formerly Americans for UNFPA ) worked to compensate for the loss of United States federal funding by raising private donations .
With 4:51 left in regulation , Carolina got the ball on their own 24-yard line with a chance to mount a game-winning drive , and soon faced 3rd-and-9 . On the next play , Miller stripped the ball away from Newton , and after several players dove for it , it took a long bounce backwards and was recovered by Ward , who returned it five yards to the Panthers 4-yard line . Although several players dove into the pile to attempt to recover it , Newton did not and his lack of aggression later earned him heavy criticism . Meanwhile , Denver 's offense was kept out of the end zone for three plays , but a holding penalty on cornerback Josh Norman gave the Broncos a new set of downs . Then Anderson scored on a 2-yard touchdown run and Manning completed a pass to Bennie Fowler for a 2-point conversion , giving Denver a 24–10 lead with 3:08 left and essentially putting the game away . Carolina had two more drives , but failed to get a first down on each one .
Denver took the opening kickoff and started out strong with Peyton Manning completing an 18-yard pass to tight end Owen Daniels and a 22-yard throw to receiver Andre Caldwell . A pair of carries by C. J. Anderson moved the ball up 20 yards to the Panthers 14-yard line , but Carolina 's defense dug in over the next three plays . First , linebacker Shaq Thompson tackled Ronnie Hillman for a 3-yard loss . Then after an incompletion , Thomas Davis tackled Anderson for a 1-yard gain on third down , forcing Denver to settle for a 3–0 lead on a Brandon McManus 34-yard field goal . The score marked the first time in the entire postseason that Carolina was facing a deficit .
This was the first Super Bowl to feature a quarterback on both teams who was the # 1 pick in their draft classes . Manning was the # 1 selection of the 1998 NFL draft , while Newton was picked first in 2011 . The matchup also pits the top two picks of the 2011 draft against each other : Newton for Carolina and Von Miller for Denver . Manning and Newton also set the record for the largest age difference between opposing Super Bowl quarterbacks at 13 years and 48 days ( Manning was 39 , Newton was 26 ) .

Different societies apply differing criteria regarding who is classified as " black " , and these social constructs have also changed over time . In a number of countries , societal variables affect classification as much as skin color , and the social criteria for " blackness " vary . For example , in North America the term black people is not necessarily an indicator of skin color or majority ethnic ancestry , but it is instead a socially based racial classification related to being African American , with a family history associated with institutionalized slavery . In South Africa and Latin America , for instance , mixed-race people are generally not classified as " black . " In South Pacific regions such as Australia and Melanesia , European colonists applied the term " black " or it was used by populations with different histories and ethnic origin .
Chinese political philosophy dates back to the Spring and Autumn Period , specifically with Confucius in the 6th century BC . Chinese political philosophy was developed as a response to the social and political breakdown of the country characteristic of the Spring and Autumn Period and the Warring States period . The major philosophies during the period , Confucianism , Legalism , Mohism , Agrarianism and Taoism , each had a political aspect to their philosophical schools . Philosophers such as Confucius , Mencius , and Mozi , focused on political unity and political stability as the basis of their political philosophies . Confucianism advocated a hierarchical , meritocratic government based on empathy , loyalty , and interpersonal relationships . Legalism advocated a highly authoritarian government based on draconian punishments and laws . Mohism advocated a communal , decentralized government centered on frugality and ascetism . The Agrarians advocated a peasant utopian communalism and egalitarianism . Taoism advocated a proto-anarchism . Legalism was the dominant political philosophy of the Qin Dynasty , but was replaced by State Confucianism in the Han Dynasty . Prior to China 's adoption of communism , State Confucianism remained the dominant political philosophy of China up to the 20th century .
The cardinal protodeacon , the senior cardinal deacon in order of appointment to the College of Cardinals , has the privilege of announcing a new pope 's election and name ( once he has been ordained to the Episcopate ) from the central balcony at the Basilica of Saint Peter in Vatican City State . In the past , during papal coronations , the proto-deacon also had the honor of bestowing the pallium on the new pope and crowning him with the papal tiara . However , in 1978 Pope John Paul I chose not to be crowned and opted for a simpler papal inauguration ceremony , and his three successors followed that example . As a result , the Cardinal protodeacon 's privilege of crowning a new pope has effectively ceased although it could be revived if a future Pope were to restore a coronation ceremony . However , the proto-deacon still has the privilege of bestowing the pallium on a new pope at his papal inauguration . “ Acting in the place of the Roman Pontiff , he also confers the pallium upon metropolitan bishops or gives the pallium to their proxies. ” The current cardinal proto-deacon is Renato Raffaele Martino .

Luther devised the catechism as a method of imparting the basics of Christianity to the congregations . In 1529 , he wrote the Large Catechism , a manual for pastors and teachers , as well as a synopsis , the Small Catechism , to be memorised by the people themselves . The catechisms provided easy-to-understand instructional and devotional material on the Ten Commandments , the Apostles ' Creed , the Lord 's Prayer , baptism , and the Lord 's Supper . Luther incorporated questions and answers in the catechism so that the basics of Christian faith would not just be learned by rote , " the way monkeys do it " , but understood .
Luther came to understand justification as entirely the work of God . This teaching by Luther was clearly expressed in his 1525 publication On the Bondage of the Will , which was written in response to On Free Will by Desiderius Erasmus ( 1524 ) . Luther based his position on predestination on St. Paul 's epistle to the Ephesians 2:8–10 . Against the teaching of his day that the righteous acts of believers are performed in cooperation with God , Luther wrote that Christians receive such righteousness entirely from outside themselves ; that righteousness not only comes from Christ but actually is the righteousness of Christ , imputed to Christians ( rather than infused into them ) through faith . " That is why faith alone makes someone just and fulfills the law , " he wrote . " Faith is that which brings the Holy Spirit through the merits of Christ . " Faith , for Luther , was a gift from God ; the experience of being justified by faith was " as though I had been born again . " His entry into Paradise , no less , was a discovery about " the righteousness of God " – a discovery that " the just person " of whom the Bible speaks ( as in Romans 1:17 ) lives by faith . He explained his concept of " justification " in the Smalcald Articles :
The Sydney Mandolins ( Artistic Director : Adrian Hooper ) have contributed greatly to the repertoire through commissioning over 200 works by Australian and International composers . Most of these works have been released on Compact Disks and can regularly be heard on radio stations on the ABC and MBS networks . One of their members , mandolin virtuoso Paul Hooper , has had a number of Concertos written for him by composers such as Eric Gross . He has performed and recorded these works with the Sydney Symphony Orchestra and the Tasmanian Symphony Orchestra . As well , Paul Hooper has had many solo works dedicated to him by Australian composers e.g. , Caroline Szeto , Ian Shanahan , Larry Sitsky and Michael Smetanin .
After the First World War , however , it became apparent that the number of mixed-race people was growing at a faster rate than the white population , and by 1930 fear of the " half-caste menace " undermining the White Australia ideal from within was being taken as a serious concern . Dr. Cecil Cook , the Northern Territory Protector of Natives , noted that :
To avoid confusing or upsetting the people , Luther avoided extreme change . He also did not wish to replace one controlling system with another . He concentrated on the church in the Electorate of Saxony , acting only as an adviser to churches in new territories , many of which followed his Saxon model . He worked closely with the new elector , John the Steadfast , to whom he turned for secular leadership and funds on behalf of a church largely shorn of its assets and income after the break with Rome . For Luther 's biographer Martin Brecht , this partnership " was the beginning of a questionable and originally unintended development towards a church government under the temporal sovereign " . The elector authorised a visitation of the church , a power formerly exercised by bishops . At times , Luther 's practical reforms fell short of his earlier radical pronouncements . For example , the Instructions for the Visitors of Parish Pastors in Electoral Saxony ( 1528 ) , drafted by Melanchthon with Luther 's approval , stressed the role of repentance in the forgiveness of sins , despite Luther 's position that faith alone ensures justification . The Eisleben reformer Johannes Agricola challenged this compromise , and Luther condemned him for teaching that faith is separate from works . The Instruction is a problematic document for those seeking a consistent evolution in Luther 's thought and practice .
Others have rejected that the doctrine of Immaculate Conception exists in Islam , the Quranic account does not confirm the Immaculate Conception exclusively for Mary as in Islam every human child is born pure and immaculate , her sinless birth is thus independent of the Christian docrtrine of original sin as no such doctrine exists in Islam . Moreover , Hannah 's prayer in the Quran for her child to remain protected from Satan ( Shayṭān ) was said after it had already been born , not before and expresses a natural concern any righteous parent would have . The Muslim tradition or hadith , which states that the only children born without the " touch of Satan , " were Mary and Jesus . should therefore not be taken in isolation from the Quran , and is to be interpreted within the specific context of exonerating Mary and her child from the charges that were made against them and is not a general statement . The specific mention of Mary and Jesus in this hadith may also be taken to represent a class of people , in keeping with the Arabic language and the Quranic verse [ O Satan ] surely thou shalt have no power over My servants , except such of the erring ones as choose to follow thee ( 15:42 )
In 1507 , he was ordained to the priesthood , and in 1508 , von Staupitz , first dean of the newly founded University of Wittenberg , sent for Luther , to teach theology . He received a bachelor 's degree in Biblical studies on 9 March 1508 , and another bachelor 's degree in the Sentences by Peter Lombard in 1509 .
Egypt has one of the longest histories of any modern country , arising in the tenth millennium BC as one of the world 's first nation states . Considered a cradle of civilisation , Ancient Egypt experienced some of the earliest developments of writing , agriculture , urbanisation , organised religion and central government . Iconic monuments such as the Giza Necropolis and its Great Sphinx , as well the ruins of Memphis , Thebes , Karnak , and the Valley of the Kings , reflect this legacy and remain a significant focus of archaeological study and popular interest worldwide . Egypt 's rich cultural heritage is an integral part of its national identity , having endured , and at times assimilated , various foreign influences , including Greek , Persian , Roman , Arab , Ottoman , and European . Although Christianised in the first century of the Common Era , it was subsequently Islamised due to the Islamic conquests of the seventh century .
The term cardinal at one time applied to any priest permanently assigned or incardinated to a church , or specifically to the senior priest of an important church , based on the Latin cardo ( hinge ) , meaning " principal " or " chief " . The term was applied in this sense as early as the ninth century to the priests of the tituli ( parishes ) of the diocese of Rome . The Church of England retains an instance of this origin of the title , which is held by the two senior members of the College of Minor Canons of St Paul 's Cathedral .
The early Christian philosophy of Augustine of Hippo was heavily influenced by Plato . A key change brought about by Christian thought was the moderatation of the Stoicism and theory of justice of the Roman world , as well emphasis on the role of the state in applying mercy as a moral example . Augustine also preached that one was not a member of his or her city , but was either a citizen of the City of God ( Civitas Dei ) or the City of Man ( Civitas Terrena ) . Augustine 's City of God is an influential work of this period that attacked the thesis , held by many Christian Romans , that the Christian view could be realized on Earth .
This was the first Super Bowl to feature a quarterback on both teams who was the # 1 pick in their draft classes . Manning was the # 1 selection of the 1998 NFL draft , while Newton was picked first in 2011 . The matchup also pits the top two picks of the 2011 draft against each other : Newton for Carolina and Von Miller for Denver . Manning and Newton also set the record for the largest age difference between opposing Super Bowl quarterbacks at 13 years and 48 days ( Manning was 39 , Newton was 26 ) .
In late November 2015 , reports surfaced stating that " multiple acts " would perform during the halftime show . On December 3 , the league confirmed that the show would be headlined by the British rock group Coldplay . On January 7 , 2016 , Pepsi confirmed to the Associated Press that Beyoncé , who headlined the Super Bowl XLVII halftime show and collaborated with Coldplay on the single " Hymn for the Weekend " , would be making an appearance . Bruno Mars , who headlined the Super Bowl XLVIII halftime show , and Mark Ronson also performed .
As a result of modernisation efforts over the years , Egypt 's healthcare system has made great strides forward . Access to healthcare in both urban and rural areas greatly improved and immunisation programs are now able to cover 98 % of the population . Life expectancy increased from 44.8 years during the 1960s to 72.12 years in 2009 . There was a noticeable decline of the infant mortality rate ( during the 1970s to the 1980s the infant mortality rate was 101-132/1000 live births , in 2000 the rate was 50-60/1000 , and in 2008 it was 28-30/1000 ) .
After a punt from both teams , Carolina got on track with a 9-play , 73-yard scoring drive . Newton completed 4 of 4 passes for 51 yards and rushed twice for 25 yards , while Jonathan Stewart finished the drive with a 1-yard touchdown run , cutting the score to 10–7 with 11:28 left in the second quarter . Later on , Broncos receiver Jordan Norwood received Brad Nortman 's short 28-yard punt surrounded by Panthers players , but none of them attempted to make a tackle , apparently thinking Norwood had called a fair catch . Norwood had not done so , and with no resistance around him , he took off for a Super Bowl record 61-yard return before Mario Addison dragged him down on the Panthers 14-yard line . Despite Denver 's excellent field position , they could not get the ball into the end zone , so McManus kicked a 33-yard field goal that increased their lead to 13–7 .
Blues rock acts that pioneered the sound included Cream , The Jimi Hendrix Experience , and The Jeff Beck Group . Cream , in songs like " I Feel Free " ( 1966 ) combined blues rock with pop and psychedelia , particularly in the riffs and guitar solos of Eric Clapton . Jimi Hendrix produced a form of blues-influenced psychedelic rock , which combined elements of jazz , blues and rock and roll . From 1967 Jeff Beck brought lead guitar to new heights of technical virtuosity and moved blues rock in the direction of heavy rock with his band , The Jeff Beck Group . Dave Davies of The Kinks , Keith Richards of The Rolling Stones , Pete Townshend of The Who , Hendrix , Clapton and Beck all pioneered the use of new guitar effects like phasing , feedback and distortion . The Beatles began producing songs in the new hard rock style beginning with the White Album in 1968 and , with the track " Helter Skelter " , attempted to create a greater level of noise than the Who . Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic has described the " proto-metal roar " of " Helter Skelter , " while Ian MacDonald argued that " their attempts at emulating the heavy style were without exception embarrassing . "
Due to the patriarchal nature of Arab society , Arab men , including during the slave trade in North Africa , enslaved more black women than men . They used more black female slaves in domestic service and agriculture than males . The men interpreted the Qur'an to permit sexual relations between a male master and his female slave outside of marriage ( see Ma malakat aymanukum and sex ) , leading to many mixed-race children . When an enslaved woman became pregnant with her Arab master 's child , she was considered as umm walad or " mother of a child " , a status that granted her privileged rights . The child was given rights of inheritance to the father 's property , so mixed-race children could share in any wealth of the father . Because the society was patrilineal , the children took their fathers ' social status at birth and were born free .
Egypt recognises only three religions : Islam , Christianity , and Judaism . Other faiths and minority Muslim sects practised by Egyptians , such as the small Bahá'í and Ahmadi community , are not recognised by the state and face persecution since they are labelled as far right groups that threaten Egypt 's national security . Individuals , particularly Baha'is and atheists , wishing to include their religion ( or lack thereof ) on their mandatory state issued identification cards are denied this ability ( see Egyptian identification card controversy ) , and are put in the position of either not obtaining required identification or lying about their faith . A 2008 court ruling allowed members of unrecognised faiths to obtain identification and leave the religion field blank .
Luther 's rediscovery of " Christ and His salvation " was the first of two points that became the foundation for the Reformation . His railing against the sale of indulgences was based on it .
As the designated home team in the annual rotation between AFC and NFC teams , the Broncos elected to wear their road white jerseys with matching white pants . Elway stated , " We 've had Super Bowl success in our white uniforms . " The Broncos last wore matching white jerseys and pants in the Super Bowl in Super Bowl XXXIII , Elway 's last game as Denver QB , when they defeated the Atlanta Falcons 34–19 . In their only other Super Bowl win in Super Bowl XXXII , Denver wore blue jerseys , which was their primary color at the time . They also lost Super Bowl XXI when they wore white jerseys , but they are 0-4 in Super Bowls when wearing orange jerseys , losing in Super Bowl XII , XXII , XXIV , and XLVIII . The only other AFC champion team to have worn white as the designated home team in the Super Bowl was the Pittsburgh Steelers ; they defeated the Seattle Seahawks 21–10 in Super Bowl XL 10 seasons prior . The Broncos ' decision to wear white meant the Panthers would wear their standard home uniform : black jerseys with silver pants .
There is disagreement about the origin of the term , but general consensus that " cardinalis " from the word cardo ( meaning 'pivot ' or 'hinge ' ) was first used in late antiquity to designate a bishop or priest who was incorporated into a church for which he had not originally been ordained . In Rome the first persons to be called cardinals were the deacons of the seven regions of the city at the beginning of the 6th century , when the word began to mean “ principal , ” “ eminent , ” or " superior . " The name was also given to the senior priest in each of the " title " churches ( the parish churches ) of Rome and to the bishops of the seven sees surrounding the city . By the 8th century the Roman cardinals constituted a privileged class among the Roman clergy . They took part in the administration of the church of Rome and in the papal liturgy . By decree of a synod of 769 , only a cardinal was eligible to become pope . In 1059 , during the pontificate of Nicholas II , cardinals were given the right to elect the pope under the Papal Bull In nomine Domini . For a time this power was assigned exclusively to the cardinal bishops , but the Third Lateran Council in 1179 gave back the right to the whole body of cardinals . Cardinals were granted the privilege of wearing the red hat by Pope Innocent IV in 1244 .
In 1975 , Sadat shifted Nasser 's economic policies and sought to use his popularity to reduce government regulations and encourage foreign investment through his program of Infitah . Through this policy , incentives such as reduced taxes and import tariffs attracted some investors , but investments were mainly directed at low risk and profitable ventures like tourism and construction , abandoning Egypt 's infant industries . Even though Sadat 's policy was intended to modernise Egypt and assist the middle class , it mainly benefited the higher class , and , because of the elimination of subsidies on basic foodstuffs , led to the 1977 Egyptian Bread Riots .
The city council of the city of Bern decided against having twinned cities except for a temporary ( during the UEFA Euro 2008 ) cooperation with the Austrian city Salzburg
In contrast to the views of John Calvin and Philipp Melanchthon , throughout his life Luther maintained that it was not false doctrine to believe that a Christian 's soul sleeps after it is separated from the body in death ; and , accordingly , he disputed traditional interpretations of some Bible passages , such as the parable of the rich man and Lazarus . This also led Luther to reject the idea of torments for the saints : " It is enough for us to know that souls do not leave their bodies to be threatened by the torments and punishments of hell , but enter a prepared bedchamber in which they sleep in peace . " He also rejected the existence of Purgatory , which involved Christian souls undergoing penitential suffering after death . He affirmed the continuity of one 's personal identity beyond death . In his Smalcald Articles , he described the saints as currently residing " in their graves and in heaven . "
Mandolin has also been used in blues music , most notably by Ry Cooder , who performed outstanding covers on his very first recordings , Yank Rachell , Johnny " Man " Young , Carl Martin , and Gerry Hundt . Howard Armstrong , who is famous for blues violin , got his start with his father 's mandolin and played in string bands similar to the other Tennessee string bands he came into contact with , with band makeup including " mandolins and fiddles and guitars and banjos . And once in a while they would ease a little ukulele in there and a bass fiddle . " Other blues players from the era 's string bands include Willie Black ( Whistler And His Jug Band ) , Dink Brister , Jim Hill , Charles Johnson , Coley Jones ( Dallas String Band ) , Bobby Leecan ( Need More Band ) , Alfred Martin , Charlie McCoy ( 1909-1950 ) , Al Miller , Matthew Prater , and Herb Quinn .
The expansion of mandolin use continued after World War II through the late 1960s , and Japan still maintains a strong classical music tradition using mandolins , with active orchestras and university music programs . New orchestras were founded and new orchestral compositions composed . Japanese mandolin orchestras today may consist of up to 40 or 50 members , and can include woodwind , percussion , and brass sections . Japan also maintains an extensive collection of 20th Century mandolin music from Europe and one of the most complete collections of mandolin magazines from mandolin 's golden age , purchased by Morishige Takei .
On November 17 , 1987 , SCA acquired CBS Records , which hosted such acts as Michael Jackson , for US $ 2 billion . CBS Inc. , now CBS Corporation , retained the rights to the CBS name for music recordings but granted Sony a temporary license to use the CBS name . CBS Corporation founded a new CBS Records in 2006 , which is distributed by Sony through its RED subsidiary .
The Negritos are believed to be the first inhabitants of Southeast Asia . Once inhabiting Taiwan , Vietnam , and various other parts of Asia , they are now confined primarily to Thailand , the Malay Archipelago , and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands . Negrito means " little black people " in Spanish ( negrito is the Spanish diminutive of negro , i.e. , " little black person " ) ; it is what the Spaniards called the short-statured , hunter-gatherer autochthones that they encountered in the Philippines . Despite this , Negritos are never referred to as black today , and doing so would cause offense . The term Negrito itself has come under criticism in countries like Malaysia , where it is now interchangeable with the more acceptable Semang , although this term actually refers to a specific group . The common Thai word for Negritos literally means " frizzy hair " .
According to UNFPA these elements promote the right of " reproductive health " , that is physical , mental , and social health in matters related to reproduction and the reproductive system .

Publius Vergilius Maro ( Classical Latin : [ ˈpuː.blɪ.ʊs wɛrˈɡɪ.lɪ.ʊs ˈma.roː ] ; October 15 , 70 BC – September 21 , 19 BC ) , usually called Virgil or Vergil /ˈvɜːrdʒᵻl/ in English , was an ancient Roman poet of the Augustan period . He is known for three major works of Latin literature , the Eclogues ( or Bucolics ) , the Georgics , and the epic Aeneid . A number of minor poems , collected in the Appendix Vergiliana , are sometimes attributed to him .
The element was probably named by the alchemist Paracelsus after the German word Zinke ( prong , tooth ) . German chemist Andreas Sigismund Marggraf is credited with discovering pure metallic zinc in 1746 . Work by Luigi Galvani and Alessandro Volta uncovered the electrochemical properties of zinc by 1800 . Corrosion-resistant zinc plating of iron ( hot-dip galvanizing ) is the major application for zinc . Other applications are in batteries , small non-structural castings , and alloys , such as brass . A variety of zinc compounds are commonly used , such as zinc carbonate and zinc gluconate ( as dietary supplements ) , zinc chloride ( in deodorants ) , zinc pyrithione ( anti-dandruff shampoos ) , zinc sulfide ( in luminescent paints ) , and zinc methyl or zinc diethyl in the organic laboratory .
Archbishop Albrecht of Mainz and Magdeburg did not reply to Luther 's letter containing the 95 Theses . He had the theses checked for heresy and in December 1517 forwarded them to Rome . He needed the revenue from the indulgences to pay off a papal dispensation for his tenure of more than one bishopric . As Luther later noted , " the pope had a finger in the pie as well , because one half was to go to the building of St Peter 's Church in Rome " .
However , this oft-quoted saying of Tetzel was by no means representative of contemporary Catholic teaching on indulgences , but rather a reflection of his capacity to exaggerate . Yet if Tetzel overstated the matter in regard to indulgences for the dead , his teaching on indulgences for the living was in line with Catholic dogma of the time .
The Lutheran theologian Franz Pieper observed that Luther 's teaching about the state of the Christian 's soul after death differed from the later Lutheran theologians such as Johann Gerhard . Lessing ( 1755 ) had earlier reached the same conclusion in his analysis of Lutheran orthodoxy on this issue .
According to the commentators , Virgil received his first education when he was five years old and he later went to Cremona , Milan , and finally Rome to study rhetoric , medicine , and astronomy , which he soon abandoned for philosophy . From Virgil 's admiring references to the neoteric writers Pollio and Cinna , it has been inferred that he was , for a time , associated with Catullus ' neoteric circle . However schoolmates considered Virgil extremely shy and reserved , according to Servius , and he was nicknamed " Parthenias " or " maiden " because of his social aloofness . Virgil seems to have suffered bad health throughout his life and in some ways lived the life of an invalid . According to the Catalepton , while in the Epicurean school of Siro the Epicurean at Naples , he began to write poetry . A group of small works attributed to the youthful Virgil by the commentators survive collected under the title Appendix Vergiliana , but are largely considered spurious by scholars . One , the Catalepton , consists of fourteen short poems , some of which may be Virgil 's , and another , a short narrative poem titled the Culex ( " The Gnat " ) , was attributed to Virgil as early as the 1st century AD .
After each team punted , Panthers quarterback Cam Newton appeared to complete a 24-yard pass Jerricho Cotchery , but the call was ruled an incompletion and upheld after a replay challenge . CBS analyst and retired referee Mike Carey stated he disagreed with the call and felt the review clearly showed the pass was complete . A few plays later , on 3rd-and-10 from the 15-yard line , linebacker Von Miller knocked the ball out of Newton 's hands while sacking him , and Malik Jackson recovered it in the end zone for a Broncos touchdown , giving the team a 10–0 lead . This was the first fumble return touchdown in a Super Bowl since Super Bowl XXVIII at the end of the 1993 season .
It was not until January 1518 that friends of Luther translated the 95 Theses from Latin into German and printed and widely copied them , making the controversy one of the first in history to be aided by the printing press . Within two weeks , copies of the theses had spread throughout Germany ; within two months , they had spread throughout Europe .
The City Parliament ( de : Stadtrat , fr : Conseil de ville ) holds legislative power . It is made up of 80 members , with elections held every four years . The City Parliament decrees regulations and by-laws that are executed by the City Council and the administration . The delegates are selected by means of a system of proportional representation .
Although the self is distinct from identity , the literature of self-psychology can offer some insight into how identity is maintained ( Cote & Levin 2002 , p. 24 ) . From the vantage point of self-psychology , there are two areas of interest : the processes by which a self is formed ( the " I " ) , and the actual content of the schemata which compose the self-concept ( the " Me " ) . In the latter field , theorists have shown interest in relating the self-concept to self-esteem , the differences between complex and simple ways of organizing self-knowledge , and the links between those organizing principles and the processing of information ( Cote & Levin 2002 ) .
Economic conditions have started to improve considerably , after a period of stagnation , due to the adoption of more liberal economic policies by the government as well as increased revenues from tourism and a booming stock market . In its annual report , the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) has rated Egypt as one of the top countries in the world undertaking economic reforms . Some major economic reforms undertaken by the government since 2003 include a dramatic slashing of customs and tariffs . A new taxation law implemented in 2005 decreased corporate taxes from 40 % to the current 20 % , resulting in a stated 100 % increase in tax revenue by the year 2006 .
A funicular railway leads from the Marzili district to the Bundeshaus . The Marzilibahn funicular is , with a length of 106 m ( 348 ft ) , the second shortest public railway in Europe after the Zagreb funicular .
The etymology of the name Bern is uncertain . According to the local legend , based on folk etymology , Berchtold V , Duke of Zähringen , the founder of the city of Bern , vowed to name the city after the first animal he met on the hunt , and this turned out to be a bear . It has long been considered likely that the city was named after the Italian city of Verona , which at the time was known as Bern in Middle High German . As a result of the find of the Bern zinc tablet in the 1980s , it is now more common to assume that the city was named after a pre-existing toponym of Celtic origin , possibly *berna " cleft " . The bear was the heraldic animal of the seal and coat of arms of Bern from at least the 1220s . The earliest reference to the keeping of live bears in the Bärengraben dates to the 1440s .
Since the 1980s , Lutheran Church denominations have repudiated Martin Luther 's statements against the Jews and have rejected the use of them to incite hatred against Lutherans . Strommen et al . 's 1970 survey of 4,745 North American Lutherans aged 15–65 found that , compared to the other minority groups under consideration , Lutherans were the least prejudiced toward Jews . Nevertheless , Professor Richard ( Dick ) Geary , former Professor of Modern History at the University of Nottingham , England , and the author of Hitler and Nazism ( Routledge 1993 ) , wrote in the journal History Today an article on who voted for the Nazis in elections held from 1928-1933 , where he claimed that from his research he found that the Nazis gained disproportionately more votes from Protestant than Catholic areas of Germany .
In cities other than Rome , the name cardinal began to be applied to certain church men as a mark of honour . The earliest example of this occurs in a letter sent by Pope Zacharias in 747 to Pippin III ( the Short ) , ruler of the Franks , in which Zacharias applied the title to the priests of Paris to distinguish them from country clergy . This meaning of the word spread rapidly , and from the 9th century various episcopal cities had a special class among the clergy known as cardinals . The use of the title was reserved for the cardinals of Rome in 1567 by Pius V .
The Egyptian military has dozens of factories manufacturing weapons as well as consumer goods . The Armed Forces ' inventory includes equipment from different countries around the world . Equipment from the former Soviet Union is being progressively replaced by more modern US , French , and British equipment , a significant portion of which is built under license in Egypt , such as the M1 Abrams tank . [ citation needed ] Relations with Russia have improved significantly following Mohamed Morsi 's removal and both countries have worked since then to strengthen military and trade ties among other aspects of bilateral co-operation . Relations with China have also improved considerably . In 2014 , Egypt and China have established a bilateral " comprehensive strategic partnership " .
Concerns were raised over whether Levi 's Stadium 's field was of a high enough quality to host a Super Bowl ; during the inaugural season , the field had to be re-sodded multiple times due to various issues , and during a week 6 game earlier in the 2015 season , a portion of the turf collapsed under Baltimore Ravens kicker Justin Tucker , causing him to slip and miss a field goal , although the field has not had any major issues since . As is customary for Super Bowl games played at natural grass stadiums , the NFL re-sodded the field with a new playing surface ; a hybrid Bermuda 419 turf . NFL and Atlanta Braves field director Ed Mangan stated that the field was in " great shape " for gameday . However , the turf showed problem throughout the game , with a number of players needing to change their cleats during the game and player slipping during plays all throughout the game .
Roughly one quarter of all zinc output in the United States ( 2009 ) , is consumed in the form of zinc compounds ; a variety of which are used industrially . Zinc oxide is widely used as a white pigment in paints , and as a catalyst in the manufacture of rubber . It is also used as a heat disperser for the rubber and acts to protect its polymers from ultraviolet radiation ( the same UV protection is conferred to plastics containing zinc oxide ) . The semiconductor properties of zinc oxide make it useful in varistors and photocopying products . The zinc zinc-oxide cycle is a two step thermochemical process based on zinc and zinc oxide for hydrogen production .
Groups that emerged from the American psychedelic scene about the same time included Iron Butterfly , MC5 , Blue Cheer and Vanilla Fudge . San Francisco band Blue Cheer released a crude and distorted cover of Eddie Cochran 's classic " Summertime Blues " , from their 1968 debut album Vincebus Eruptum , that outlined much of the later hard rock and heavy metal sound . The same month , Steppenwolf released its self-titled debut album , including " Born to Be Wild " , which contained the first lyrical reference to heavy metal and helped popularise the style when it was used in the film Easy Rider ( 1969 ) . Iron Butterfly 's In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida ( 1968 ) , with its 17-minute-long title track , using organs and with a lengthy drum solo , also prefigured later elements of the sound .

Formed in November 1990 by the equal merger of Sky Television and British Satellite Broadcasting , BSkyB became the UK 's largest digital subscription television company . Following BSkyB 's 2014 acquisition of Sky Italia and a majority 90.04 % interest in Sky Deutschland in November 2014 , its holding company British Sky Broadcasting Group plc changed its name to Sky plc . The United Kingdom operations also changed the company name from British Sky Broadcasting Limited to Sky UK Limited , still trading as Sky .
Bern is built on very uneven ground . There is an elevation difference of several metres between the inner city districts on the Aare ( Matte , Marzili ) and the higher ones ( Kirchenfeld , Länggasse ) .
According to the tradition , Virgil traveled to Greece in about 19 BC to revise the Aeneid . After meeting Augustus in Athens and deciding to return home , Virgil caught a fever while visiting a town near Megara . After crossing to Italy by ship , weakened with disease , Virgil died in Brundisium harbor on September 21 , 19 BC . Augustus ordered Virgil 's literary executors , Lucius Varius Rufus and Plotius Tucca , to disregard Virgil 's own wish that the poem be burned , instead ordering it published with as few editorial changes as possible . As a result , the text of the Aeneid that exists may contain faults which Virgil was planning to correct before publication . However , the only obvious imperfections are a few lines of verse that are metrically unfinished ( i.e . not a complete line of dactylic hexameter ) . Some scholars have argued that Virgil deliberately left these metrically incomplete lines for dramatic effect . Other alleged imperfections are subject to scholarly debate .
Following their loss in the divisional round of the previous season 's playoffs , the Denver Broncos underwent numerous coaching changes , including a mutual parting with head coach John Fox ( who had won four divisional championships in his four years as Broncos head coach ) , and the hiring of Gary Kubiak as the new head coach . Under Kubiak , the Broncos planned to install a run-oriented offense with zone blocking to blend in with quarterback Peyton Manning 's shotgun passing skills , but struggled with numerous changes and injuries to the offensive line , as well as Manning having his worst statistical season since his rookie year with the Indianapolis Colts in 1998 , due to a plantar fasciitis injury in his heel that he had suffered since the summer , and the simple fact that Manning was getting old , as he turned 39 in the 2015 off-season . Although the team had a 7–0 start , Manning led the NFL in interceptions . In week 10 , Manning suffered a partial tear of the plantar fasciitis in his left foot . He set the NFL 's all-time record for career passing yards in this game , but was benched after throwing four interceptions in favor of backup quarterback Brock Osweiler , who took over as the starter for most of the remainder of the regular season . Osweiler was injured , however , leading to Manning 's return during the Week 17 regular season finale , where the Broncos were losing 13–7 against the 4–11 San Diego Chargers , resulting in Manning re-claiming the starting quarterback position for the playoffs by leading the team to a key 27–20 win that enabled the team to clinch the number one overall AFC seed . Under defensive coordinator Wade Phillips , the Broncos ' defense ranked number one in total yards allowed , passing yards allowed and sacks , and like the previous three seasons , the team has continued to set numerous individual , league and franchise records . With the defense carrying the team despite the issues with the offense , the Broncos finished the regular season with a 12–4 record and earned home-field advantage throughout the AFC playoffs .
An apoplectic stroke deprived him of his speech , and he died shortly afterwards at 2:45 a.m. on 18 February 1546 , aged 62 , in Eisleben , the city of his birth . He was buried in the Castle Church in Wittenberg , beneath the pulpit . The funeral was held by his friends Johannes Bugenhagen and Philipp Melanchthon . A year later , troops of Luther 's adversary Charles V , Holy Roman Emperor entered the town , but were ordered by Charles not to disturb the grave .
In honor of the 50th Super Bowl , the pregame ceremony featured the on-field introduction of 39 of the 43 previous Super Bowl Most Valuable Players . Bart Starr ( MVP of Super Bowls I and II ) and Chuck Howley ( MVP of Super Bowl V ) appeared via video , while Peyton Manning ( MVP of Super Bowl XLI and current Broncos quarterback ) was shown in the locker room preparing for the game . No plans were announced regarding the recognition of Harvey Martin , co-MVP of Super Bowl XII , who died in 2001 .
The Panthers seemed primed to score on their opening drive of the second half when Newton completed a 45-yard pass to Ted Ginn Jr. on the Denver 35-yard line on their second offensive play . But the Broncos defense halted the drive on the 26-yard line , and it ended with no points when Graham Gano hit the uprights on a 44-yard field goal attempt . After the miss , Manning completed a pair of passes to Emmanuel Sanders for gains of 25 and 22 yards , setting up McManus ' 33-yard field goal that gave the Broncos a 16–7 lead . Carolina got off to another strong start after the kickoff , with Newton completing a 42-yard pass to Corey Brown . But once again they came up empty , this time as a result of a Newton pass that bounced off the hands of Ginn and was intercepted by safety T. J . Ward . Ward fumbled the ball during the return , but Trevathan recovered it to enable Denver to keep possession .
Cairo University is ranked as 401-500 according to the Academic Ranking of World Universities ( Shanghai Ranking ) and 551-600 according to QS World University Rankings . American University in Cairo is ranked as 360 according to QS World University Rankings and Al-Azhar University , Alexandria University and Ain Shams University fall in the 701+ range . Egypt is currently opening new research institutes for the aim of modernising research in the nation , the most recent example of which is Zewail City of Science and Technology .
At the time of the Marburg Colloquy , Suleiman the Magnificent was besieging Vienna with a vast Ottoman army . Luther had argued against resisting the Turks in his 1518 Explanation of the Ninety-five Theses , provoking accusations of defeatism . He saw the Turks as a scourge sent to punish Christians by God , as agents of the Biblical apocalypse that would destroy the antichrist , whom Luther believed to be the papacy , and the Roman Church . He consistently rejected the idea of a Holy War , " as though our people were an army of Christians against the Turks , who were enemies of Christ . This is absolutely contrary to Christ 's doctrine and name " . On the other hand , in keeping with his doctrine of the two kingdoms , Luther did support non-religious war against the Turks . In 1526 , he argued in Whether Soldiers can be in a State of Grace that national defence is reason for a just war . By 1529 , in On War against the Turk , he was actively urging Emperor Charles V and the German people to fight a secular war against the Turks . He made clear , however , that the spiritual war against an alien faith was separate , to be waged through prayer and repentance . Around the time of the Siege of Vienna , Luther wrote a prayer for national deliverance from the Turks , asking God to " give to our emperor perpetual victory over our enemies " .
BSkyB launched its HDTV service , Sky+ HD , on 22 May 2006 . Prior to its launch , BSkyB claimed that 40,000 people had registered to receive the HD service . In the week before the launch , rumours started to surface that BSkyB was having supply issues with its set top box ( STB ) from manufacturer Thomson . On Thursday 18 May 2006 , and continuing through the weekend before launch , people were reporting that BSkyB had either cancelled or rescheduled its installation . Finally , the BBC reported that 17,000 customers had yet to receive the service due to failed deliveries . On 31 March 2012 , Sky announced the total number of homes with Sky+HD was 4,222,000 .
Luther was the most widely read author of his generation , and within Germany he acquired the status of a prophet . According to the prevailing view among historians , his anti-Jewish rhetoric contributed significantly to the development of antisemitism in Germany , and in the 1930s and 1940s provided an " ideal underpinning " for the Nazis ' attacks on Jews . Reinhold Lewin writes that anybody who " wrote against the Jews for whatever reason believed he had the right to justify himself by triumphantly referring to Luther . " According to Michael , just about every anti-Jewish book printed in the Third Reich contained references to and quotations from Luther . Heinrich Himmler wrote admiringly of his writings and sermons on the Jews in 1940 . The city of Nuremberg presented a first edition of On the Jews and their Lies to Julius Streicher , editor of the Nazi newspaper Der Stürmer , on his birthday in 1937 ; the newspaper described it as the most radically anti-Semitic tract ever published . It was publicly exhibited in a glass case at the Nuremberg rallies and quoted in a 54-page explanation of the Aryan Law by Dr. E.H. Schulz and Dr. R. Frercks .
The celebrated John Duns Scotus ( d. 1308 ) , a Friar Minor like Saint Bonaventure , argued , on the contrary , that from a rational point of view it was certainly as little derogatory to the merits of Christ to assert that Mary was by him preserved from all taint of sin , as to say that she first contracted it and then was delivered . Proposing a solution to the theological problem of reconciling the doctrine with that of universal redemption in Christ , he argued that Mary 's immaculate conception did not remove her from redemption by Christ ; rather it was the result of a more perfect redemption granted her because of her special role in salvation history .
The element was probably named by the alchemist Paracelsus after the German word Zinke ( prong , tooth ) . German chemist Andreas Sigismund Marggraf is credited with discovering pure metallic zinc in 1746 . Work by Luigi Galvani and Alessandro Volta uncovered the electrochemical properties of zinc by 1800 . Corrosion-resistant zinc plating of iron ( hot-dip galvanizing ) is the major application for zinc . Other applications are in batteries , small non-structural castings , and alloys , such as brass . A variety of zinc compounds are commonly used , such as zinc carbonate and zinc gluconate ( as dietary supplements ) , zinc chloride ( in deodorants ) , zinc pyrithione ( anti-dandruff shampoos ) , zinc sulfide ( in luminescent paints ) , and zinc methyl or zinc diethyl in the organic laboratory .
On the other hand , Luther also points out that the Ten Commandments – when considered not as God 's condemning judgment but as an expression of his eternal will , that is , of the natural law – also positively teach how the Christian ought to live . This has traditionally been called the " third use of the law . " For Luther , also Christ 's life , when understood as an example , is nothing more than an illustration of the Ten Commandments , which a Christian should follow in his or her vocations on a daily basis .
Some Western writers claim that the immaculate conception of Mary is a teaching of Islam . Thus , commenting in 1734 on the passage in the Qur'an , " I have called her Mary ; and I commend her to thy protection , and also her issue , against Satan driven away with stones " , George Sale stated : " It is not improbable that the pretended immaculate conception of the virgin Mary is intimated in this passage . For according to a tradition of Mohammed , every person that comes into the world , is touched at his birth by the devil , and therefore cries out , Mary and her son only excepted ; between whom , and the evil spirit God placed a veil , so that his touch did not reach them . And for this reason they say , neither of them were guilty of any sin , like the rest of the children of Adam . "
From the late 19th century , the South used a colloquial term , the one-drop rule , to classify as black a person of any known African ancestry . This practice of hypodescent was not put into law until the early 20th century . Legally the definition varied from state to state . Racial definition was more flexible in the 18th and 19th centuries before the American Civil War . For instance , President Thomas Jefferson held persons who were legally white ( less than 25 % black ) according to Virginia law at the time , but , because they were born to slave mothers , they were born into slavery , according to the principle of partus sequitur ventrem , which Virginia adopted into law in 1662 .
The flagship stations of each station in the markets of each team will carry their local play-by-play calls . In Denver , KOA ( 850 AM ) and KRFX ( 103.5 FM ) will carry the game , with Dave Logan on play-by-play and Ed McCaffrey on color commentary . In North Carolina , WBT ( 1110 AM ) will carry the game , with Mick Mixon on play-by-play and Eugene Robinson and Jim Szoke on color commentary . WBT will also simulcast the game on its sister station WBT-FM ( 99.3 FM ) , which is based in Chester , South Carolina . As KOA and WBT are both clear-channel stations , the local broadcasts will be audible over much of the western United States after sunset ( for Denver ) and the eastern United States throughout the game ( for Carolina ) . In accordance with contractual rules , the rest of the stations in the Broncos and Panthers radio networks will either carry the Westwood One feed or not carry the game at all .
Six-time Grammy winner and Academy Award nominee Lady Gaga performed the national anthem , while Academy Award winner Marlee Matlin provided American Sign Language ( ASL ) translation .
The implications are multiple as various research traditions are now [ when ? ] heavily utilizing the lens of identity to examine phenomena . [ citation needed ] One implication of identity and of identity construction can be seen in occupational settings . This becomes increasing challenging in stigmatized jobs or " dirty work " ( Hughes , 1951 ) . Tracy and Trethewey ( 2005 ) state that " individuals gravitate toward and turn away from particular jobs depending in part , on the extent to which they validate a " preferred organizational self " ( Tracy & Tretheway 2005 , p. 169 ) . Some jobs carry different stigmas or acclaims . In her analysis Tracy uses the example of correctional officers trying to shake the stigma of " glorified maids " ( Tracy & Tretheway 2005 ) . " The process by which people arrive at justifications of and values for various occupational choices . " Among these are workplace satisfaction and overall quality of life ( Tracy & Scott 2006 , p. 33 ) . People in these types of jobs are forced to find ways in order to create an identity they can live with . " Crafting a positive sense of self at work is more challenging when one 's work is considered " dirty " by societal standards " ( Tracy & Scott 2006 , p. 7 ) . " In other words , doing taint management is not just about allowing the employee to feel good in that job . " If employees must navigate discourses that question the viability of their work , and/ or experience obstacles in managing taint through transforming dirty work into a badge of honor , it is likely they will find blaming the client to be an efficacious route in affirming their identity " ( Tracy & Scott 2006 , p. 33 ) .

Cairo University is ranked as 401-500 according to the Academic Ranking of World Universities ( Shanghai Ranking ) and 551-600 according to QS World University Rankings . American University in Cairo is ranked as 360 according to QS World University Rankings and Al-Azhar University , Alexandria University and Ain Shams University fall in the 701+ range . Egypt is currently opening new research institutes for the aim of modernising research in the nation , the most recent example of which is Zewail City of Science and Technology .
In the US , African Americans , who include multiracial people , earn 75 % of what white people earn . In Brazil , people of color earn less than 50 % of what whites earn . Some have posited that the facts of lower socioeconomic status for people of color suggest that Brazil practices a kind of one-drop rule , or discrimination against people who are not visibly European in ancestry . The gap in income between blacks and other non-whites is relatively small compared to the large gap between whites and all people of color . Other social factors , such as illiteracy and education levels , show the same patterns of disadvantage for people of color . Some commentators observe that the United States practice of segregation and white supremacy in the South , and discrimination in many areas outside that region , forced many African Americans to unite in the civil rights struggle . They suggest that the fluid nature of race in Brazil has divided individuals of African descent , between those with more or less ancestry . As a result , they have not united for a stronger civil rights movement . [ citation needed ]
Though Brazilians of at least partial African heritage make up a large percentage of the population , few blacks have been elected as politicians . The city of Salvador , Bahia , for instance , is 80 % people of color , but voters have not elected a mayor of color . Journalists like to say that US cities with black majorities , such as Detroit and New Orleans , have not elected white mayors since after the civil rights movement , when the Voting Rights Act of 1965 protected the franchise for minorities , and blacks in the South regained the power to vote for the first time since the turn of the 20th century . New Orleans elected its first black mayor in the 1970s . New Orleans elected a white mayor after the widescale disruption and damage of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 .
In previous times , at the consistory at which the pope named a new cardinal , he would bestow upon him a distinctive wide-brimmed hat called a galero . This custom was discontinued in 1969 and the investiture now takes place with the scarlet biretta . In ecclesiastical heraldry , however , the scarlet galero is still displayed on the cardinal 's coat of arms . Cardinals had the right to display the galero in their cathedral , and when a cardinal died , it would be suspended from the ceiling above his tomb . Some cardinals will still have a galero made , even though it is not officially part of their apparel . [ citation needed ]
The US racial or ethnic classification " black " refers to people with all possible kinds of skin pigmentation , from the darkest through to the very lightest skin colors , including albinos , if they are believed by others to have West African ancestry ( in any discernible percentage ) , or to exhibit cultural traits associated with being " African American " . As a result , in the United States the term " black people " is not an indicator of skin color or ethnic origin but is instead a socially based racial classification related to being African American , with a family history associated with institutionalized slavery . Relatively dark-skinned people can be classified as white if they fulfill other social criteria of " whiteness " , and relatively light-skinned people can be classified as black if they fulfill the social criteria for " blackness " in a particular setting .
Some succeeded their fathers as rulers , such as Sultan Ahmad al-Mansur , who ruled Morocco from 1578 to 1608 . He was not technically considered as a mixed-race child of a slave ; his mother was Fulani and a concubine of his father . Such tolerance for black persons , even when technically " free " , was not so common in Morocco . The long association of sub-Saharan peoples as slaves is shown in the term abd ( Arabic : عبد‎ , ) ( meaning " slave " ) ; it is still frequently used in the Arabic-speaking world as a term for black people .
On December 28 , 2015 , ESPN Deportes announced that they had reached an agreement with CBS and the NFL to be the exclusive Spanish-language broadcaster of the game , marking the third dedicated Spanish-language broadcast of the Super Bowl . Unlike NBC and Fox , CBS does not have a Spanish-language outlet of its own that could broadcast the game ( though per league policy , a separate Spanish play-by-play call was carried on CBS 's second audio program channel for over-the-air viewers ) . The game was called by ESPN Deportes ' Monday Night Football commentary crew of Alvaro Martin and Raul Allegre , and sideline reporter John Sutcliffe . ESPN Deportes broadcast pre-game and post-game coverage , while Martin , Allegre , and Sutcliffe contributed English-language reports for ESPN 's SportsCenter and Mike & Mike .
CBS provided digital streams of the game via CBSSports.com , and the CBS Sports apps on tablets , Windows 10 , Xbox One and other digital media players ( such as Chromecast and Roku ) . Due to Verizon Communications exclusivity , streaming on smartphones was only provided to Verizon Wireless customers via the NFL Mobile service . The ESPN Deportes Spanish broadcast was made available through WatchESPN .
Egypt ( i/ˈiːdʒɪpt/ ; Arabic : مِصر‎ Miṣr , Egyptian Arabic : مَصر Maṣr , Coptic : Ⲭⲏⲙⲓ Khemi ) , officially the Arab Republic of Egypt , is a transcontinental country spanning the northeast corner of Africa and southwest corner of Asia , via a land bridge formed by the Sinai Peninsula . It is the world 's only contiguous Eurafrasian nation . Most of Egypt 's territory of 1,010,408 square kilometres ( 390,000 sq mi ) lies within the Nile Valley . Egypt is a Mediterranean country . It is bordered by the Gaza Strip and Israel to the northeast , the Gulf of Aqaba to the east , the Red Sea to the east and south , Sudan to the south and Libya to the west .
In the Ottoman Empire , these ideological reforms did not take place and these views did not integrate into common thought until much later . As well , there was no spread of this doctrine within the New World and the advanced civilizations of the Aztec , Maya , Inca , Mohican , Delaware , Huron and especially the Iroquois . The Iroquois philosophy in particular gave much to Christian thought of the time and in many cases actually inspired some of the institutions adopted in the United States : for example , Benjamin Franklin was a great admirer of some of the methods of the Iroquois Confederacy , and much of early American literature emphasized the political philosophy of the natives .
Established acts benefited from the new commercial climate , with Whitesnake 's self-titled album ( 1987 ) selling over 17 million copies , outperforming anything in Coverdale 's or Deep Purple 's catalogue before or since . It featured the rock anthem " Here I Go Again '87 " as one of 4 UK top 20 singles . The follow-up Slip of the Tongue ( 1989 ) went platinum , but according to critics Steve Erlwine and Greg Prato , " it was a considerable disappointment after the across-the-board success of Whitesnake " . Aerosmith 's comeback album Permanent Vacation ( 1987 ) would begin a decade long revival of their popularity . Crazy Nights ( 1987 ) by Kiss was the band 's highest charting release in the US since 1979 and the highest of their career in the UK . Mötley Crüe with Girls , Girls , Girls ( 1987 ) continued their commercial success and Def Leppard with Hysteria ( 1987 ) hit their commercial peak , the latter producing seven hit singles ( a record for a hard rock act ) . Guns N ' Roses released the best-selling début of all time , Appetite for Destruction ( 1987 ) . With a " grittier " and " rawer " sound than most glam metal , it produced three top 10 hits , including the number one " Sweet Child O ' Mine " . Some of the glam rock bands that formed in the mid-1980s , such as White Lion and Cinderella experienced their biggest success during this period with their respective albums Pride ( 1987 ) and Long Cold Winter ( 1988 ) both going multi-platinum and launching a series of hit singles . In the last years of the decade , the most notable successes were New Jersey ( 1988 ) by Bon Jovi , OU812 ( 1988 ) by Van Halen , Open Up and Say ... Ahh ! ( 1988 ) by Poison , Pump ( 1989 ) by Aerosmith , and Mötley Crüe 's most commercially successful album Dr. Feelgood ( 1989 ) . New Jersey spawned five Top 10 singles , a record for a hard rock act . In 1988 from 25 June to 5 November , the number one spot on the Billboard 200 album chart was held by a hard rock album for 18 out of 20 consecutive weeks ; the albums were OU812 , Hysteria , Appetite for Destruction , and New Jersey . A final wave of glam rock bands arrived in the late 1980s , and experienced success with multi-platinum albums and hit singles from 1989 until the early 1990s , among them Extreme , Warrant Slaughter and FireHouse . Skid Row also released their eponymous début ( 1989 ) , reaching number six on the Billboard 200 , but they were to be one of the last major bands that emerged in the glam rock era .
Even as the Western Roman empire collapsed , literate men acknowledged that Virgil was a master poet . Gregory of Tours read Virgil , whom he quotes in several places , along with some other Latin poets , though he cautions that " we ought not to relate their lying fables , lest we fall under sentence of eternal death . "
These different explorations of 'identity ' demonstrate how difficult a concept it is to pin down . Since identity is a virtual thing , it is impossible to define it empirically . Discussions of identity use the term with different meanings , from fundamental and abiding sameness , to fluidity , contingency , negotiated and so on . Brubaker and Cooper note a tendency in many scholars to confuse identity as a category of practice and as a category of analysis ( Brubaker & Cooper 2000 , p. 5 ) . Indeed , many scholars demonstrate a tendency to follow their own preconceptions of identity , following more or less the frameworks listed above , rather than taking into account the mechanisms by which the concept is crystallised as reality . In this environment , some analysts , such as Brubaker and Cooper , have suggested doing away with the concept completely ( Brubaker & Cooper 2000 , p. 1 ) . Others , by contrast , have sought to introduce alternative concepts in an attempt to capture the dynamic and fluid qualities of human social self-expression . Hall ( 1992 , 1996 ) , for example , suggests treating identity as a process , to take into account the reality of diverse and ever-changing social experience . Some scholars have introduced the idea of identification , whereby identity is perceived as made up of different components that are 'identified ' and interpreted by individuals . The construction of an individual sense of self is achieved by personal choices regarding who and what to associate with . Such approaches are liberating in their recognition of the role of the individual in social interaction and the construction of identity .
With 4:51 left in regulation , Carolina got the ball on their own 24-yard line with a chance to mount a game-winning drive , and soon faced 3rd-and-9 . On the next play , Miller stripped the ball away from Newton , and after several players dove for it , it took a long bounce backwards and was recovered by Ward , who returned it five yards to the Panthers 4-yard line . Although several players dove into the pile to attempt to recover it , Newton did not and his lack of aggression later earned him heavy criticism . Meanwhile , Denver 's offense was kept out of the end zone for three plays , but a holding penalty on cornerback Josh Norman gave the Broncos a new set of downs . Then Anderson scored on a 2-yard touchdown run and Manning completed a pass to Bennie Fowler for a 2-point conversion , giving Denver a 24–10 lead with 3:08 left and essentially putting the game away . Carolina had two more drives , but failed to get a first down on each one .
The Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life ranks Egypt as the fifth worst country in the world for religious freedom . The United States Commission on International Religious Freedom , a bipartisan independent agency of the US government , has placed Egypt on its watch list of countries that require close monitoring due to the nature and extent of violations of religious freedom engaged in or tolerated by the government . According to a 2010 Pew Global Attitudes survey , 84 % of Egyptians polled supported the death penalty for those who leave Islam ; 77 % supported whippings and cutting off of hands for theft and robbery ; and 82 % support stoning a person who commits adultery .
The city council of the city of Bern decided against having twinned cities except for a temporary ( during the UEFA Euro 2008 ) cooperation with the Austrian city Salzburg
In the Colonial America of 1619 , John Rolfe used negars in describing the slaves who were captured from West Africa and then shipped to the Virginia colony . Later American English spellings , neger and neggar , prevailed in a northern colony , New York under the Dutch , and in metropolitan Philadelphia 's Moravian and Pennsylvania Dutch communities ; the African Burial Ground in New York City originally was known by the Dutch name " Begraafplaats van de Neger " ( Cemetery of the Negro ) ; an early US occurrence of neger in Rhode Island , dates from 1625 . Thomas Jefferson also used the term " black " in his Notes on the State of Virginia in allusion to the slave populations .
Since 1962 , the cardinal bishops have only a titular relationship with the suburbicarian sees , with no powers of governance over them . Each see has its own bishop , with the exception of Ostia , in which the Cardinal Vicar of the see of Rome is apostolic administrator .
Virgin Media ( re-branded in 2007 from NTL : Telewest ) started to offer a high-definition television ( HDTV ) capable set top box , although from 30 November 2006 until 30 July 2009 it only carried one linear HD channel , BBC HD , after the conclusion of the ITV HD trial . Virgin Media has claimed that other HD channels were " locked up " or otherwise withheld from their platform , although Virgin Media did in fact have an option to carry Channel 4 HD in the future . Nonetheless , the linear channels were not offered , Virgin Media instead concentrating on its Video On Demand service to carry a modest selection of HD content . Virgin Media has nevertheless made a number of statements over the years , suggesting that more linear HD channels are on the way .
The Marxist critique of capitalism — developed with Friedrich Engels — was , alongside liberalism and fascism , one of the defining ideological movements of the Twentieth Century . The industrial revolution produced a parallel revolution in political thought . Urbanization and capitalism greatly reshaped society . During this same period , the socialist movement began to form . In the mid-19th century , Marxism was developed , and socialism in general gained increasing popular support , mostly from the urban working class . Without breaking entirely from the past , Marx established principles that would be used by future revolutionaries of the 20th century namely Vladimir Lenin , Mao Zedong , Ho Chi Minh , and Fidel Castro . Though Hegel 's philosophy of history is similar to Immanuel Kant 's , and Karl Marx 's theory of revolution towards the common good is partly based on Kant 's view of history—Marx declared that he was turning Hegel 's dialectic , which was " standing on its head " , " the right side up again " . Unlike Marx who believed in historical materialism , Hegel believed in the Phenomenology of Spirit . By the late 19th century , socialism and trade unions were established members of the political landscape . In addition , the various branches of anarchism , with thinkers such as Mikhail Bakunin , Pierre-Joseph Proudhon or Peter Kropotkin , and syndicalism also gained some prominence . In the Anglo-American world , anti-imperialism and pluralism began gaining currency at the turn of the 20th century .
In 1839 Mariano Spada ( 1796 - 1872 ) , professor of theology at the Roman College of Saint Thomas , published Esame Critico sulla dottrina dell ’ Angelico Dottore S. Tommaso di Aquino circa il Peccato originale , relativamente alla Beatissima Vergine Maria [ A critical examination of the doctrine of St. Thomas Aquinas , the Angelic Doctor , regarding original sin with respect to the Most Blessed Virgin Mary ] , in which Aquinas is interpreted not as treating the question of the Immaculate Conception later formulated in the papal bull Ineffabilis Deus but rather the sanctification of the fetus within Mary 's womb . Spada furnished an interpretation whereby Pius IX was relieved of the problem of seeming to foster a doctrine not in agreement with the Aquinas ' teaching . Pope Pius IX would later appoint Spada Master of the Sacred Palace in 1867 .
At the time of the Marburg Colloquy , Suleiman the Magnificent was besieging Vienna with a vast Ottoman army . Luther had argued against resisting the Turks in his 1518 Explanation of the Ninety-five Theses , provoking accusations of defeatism . He saw the Turks as a scourge sent to punish Christians by God , as agents of the Biblical apocalypse that would destroy the antichrist , whom Luther believed to be the papacy , and the Roman Church . He consistently rejected the idea of a Holy War , " as though our people were an army of Christians against the Turks , who were enemies of Christ . This is absolutely contrary to Christ 's doctrine and name " . On the other hand , in keeping with his doctrine of the two kingdoms , Luther did support non-religious war against the Turks . In 1526 , he argued in Whether Soldiers can be in a State of Grace that national defence is reason for a just war . By 1529 , in On War against the Turk , he was actively urging Emperor Charles V and the German people to fight a secular war against the Turks . He made clear , however , that the spiritual war against an alien faith was separate , to be waged through prayer and repentance . Around the time of the Siege of Vienna , Luther wrote a prayer for national deliverance from the Turks , asking God to " give to our emperor perpetual victory over our enemies " .
Approximately 12 million Africans were shipped to the Americas during the Atlantic slave trade from 1492 to 1888 , with 11.5 million of those shipped to South America and the Caribbean . Brazil was the largest importer in the Americas , with 5.5 million African slaves imported , followed by the British Caribbean with 2.76 million , the Spanish Caribbean and Spanish Mainland with 1.59 million Africans , and the French Caribbean with 1.32 million . Today their descendants number approximately 150 million in South America and the Caribbean . In addition to skin color , other physical characteristics such as facial features and hair texture are often variously used in classifying peoples as black in South America and the Caribbean . In South America and the Caribbean , classification as black is also closely tied to social status and socioeconomic variables , especially in light of social conceptions of " blanqueamiento " ( racial whitening ) and related concepts .
The annual NFL Experience was held at the Moscone Center in San Francisco . In addition , " Super Bowl City " opened on January 30 at Justin Herman Plaza on The Embarcadero , featuring games and activities that will highlight the Bay Area 's technology , culinary creations , and cultural diversity . More than 1 million people are expected to attend the festivities in San Francisco during Super Bowl Week . San Francisco mayor Ed Lee said of the highly visible homeless presence in this area " they are going to have to leave " . San Francisco city supervisor Jane Kim unsuccessfully lobbied for the NFL to reimburse San Francisco for city services in the amount of $ 5 million .
Luther 's Small Catechism proved especially effective in helping parents teach their children ; likewise the Larger Catechism was effective for pastors . Using the German vernacular , they expressed the Apostles ' Creed in simpler , more personal , Trinitarian language . He rewrote each article of the Creed to express the character of the Father , the Son , or the Holy Spirit . Luther 's goal was to enable the catechumens to see themselves as a personal object of the work of the three persons of the Trinity , each of which works in the catechumen 's life . That is , Luther depicted the Trinity not as a doctrine to be learned , but as persons to be known . The Father creates , the Son redeems , and the Spirit sanctifies , a divine unity with separate personalities . Salvation originates with the Father and draws the believer to the Father . Luther 's treatment of the Apostles ' Creed must be understood in the context of the Decalogue ( the Ten Commandments ) and the Lord 's Prayer , which are also part of the Lutheran catechical teaching .
Luther secretly returned to Wittenberg on 6 March 1522 . He wrote to the Elector : " During my absence , Satan has entered my sheepfold , and committed ravages which I can not repair by writing , but only by my personal presence and living word . " For eight days in Lent , beginning on Invocavit Sunday , 9 March , Luther preached eight sermons , which became known as the " Invocavit Sermons " . In these sermons , he hammered home the primacy of core Christian values such as love , patience , charity , and freedom , and reminded the citizens to trust God 's word rather than violence to bring about necessary change .
During the 2009–10 school year , there were a total of 10,979 pupils attending classes in Bern . There were 89 kindergarten classes with a total of 1,641 pupils in the municipality . Of the kindergarten pupils , 32.4 % were permanent or temporary residents of Switzerland ( not citizens ) and 40.2 % have a different mother language than the classroom language . The municipality had 266 primary classes and 5,040 pupils . Of the primary pupils , 30.1 % were permanent or temporary residents of Switzerland ( not citizens ) and 35.7 % have a different mother language than the classroom language . During the same year , there were 151 lower secondary classes with a total of 2,581 pupils . There were 28.7 % who were permanent or temporary residents of Switzerland ( not citizens ) and 32.7 % have a different mother language than the classroom language .
According to the commentators , Virgil received his first education when he was five years old and he later went to Cremona , Milan , and finally Rome to study rhetoric , medicine , and astronomy , which he soon abandoned for philosophy . From Virgil 's admiring references to the neoteric writers Pollio and Cinna , it has been inferred that he was , for a time , associated with Catullus ' neoteric circle . However schoolmates considered Virgil extremely shy and reserved , according to Servius , and he was nicknamed " Parthenias " or " maiden " because of his social aloofness . Virgil seems to have suffered bad health throughout his life and in some ways lived the life of an invalid . According to the Catalepton , while in the Epicurean school of Siro the Epicurean at Naples , he began to write poetry . A group of small works attributed to the youthful Virgil by the commentators survive collected under the title Appendix Vergiliana , but are largely considered spurious by scholars . One , the Catalepton , consists of fourteen short poems , some of which may be Virgil 's , and another , a short narrative poem titled the Culex ( " The Gnat " ) , was attributed to Virgil as early as the 1st century AD .
During the apartheid era , those classed as " Coloured " were oppressed and discriminated against . But , they had limited rights and overall had slightly better socioeconomic conditions than those classed as " Black " . The government required that Blacks and Coloureds live in areas separate from Whites , creating large townships located away from the cities as areas for Blacks .
The early Christian philosophy of Augustine of Hippo was heavily influenced by Plato . A key change brought about by Christian thought was the moderatation of the Stoicism and theory of justice of the Roman world , as well emphasis on the role of the state in applying mercy as a moral example . Augustine also preached that one was not a member of his or her city , but was either a citizen of the City of God ( Civitas Dei ) or the City of Man ( Civitas Terrena ) . Augustine 's City of God is an influential work of this period that attacked the thesis , held by many Christian Romans , that the Christian view could be realized on Earth .
Contemporaneously with the rise of analytic ethics in Anglo-American thought , in Europe several new lines of philosophy directed at critique of existing societies arose between the 1950s and 1980s . Most of these took elements of Marxist economic analysis , but combined them with a more cultural or ideological emphasis . Out of the Frankfurt School , thinkers like Herbert Marcuse , Theodor W. Adorno , Max Horkheimer , and Jürgen Habermas combined Marxian and Freudian perspectives . Along somewhat different lines , a number of other continental thinkers—still largely influenced by Marxism—put new emphases on structuralism and on a " return to Hegel " . Within the ( post- ) structuralist line ( though mostly not taking that label ) are thinkers such as Gilles Deleuze , Michel Foucault , Claude Lefort , and Jean Baudrillard . The Situationists were more influenced by Hegel ; Guy Debord , in particular , moved a Marxist analysis of commodity fetishism to the realm of consumption , and looked at the relation between consumerism and dominant ideology formation .
In the 1960s , American and British blues and rock bands began to modify rock and roll by adding harder sounds , heavier guitar riffs , bombastic drumming , and louder vocals , from electric blues . Early forms of hard rock can be heard in the work of Chicago blues musicians Elmore James , Muddy Waters , and Howlin ' Wolf , The Kingsmen 's version of " Louie Louie " ( 1963 ) which made it a garage rock standard , and the songs of rhythm and blues influenced British Invasion acts , including " You Really Got Me " by The Kinks ( 1964 ) , " My Generation " by The Who ( 1965 ) , " Shapes of Things " ( 1966 ) by The Yardbirds and " ( I Ca n't Get No ) Satisfaction " ( 1965 ) by The Rolling Stones . From the late 1960s , it became common to divide mainstream rock music that emerged from psychedelia into soft and hard rock . Soft rock was often derived from folk rock , using acoustic instruments and putting more emphasis on melody and harmonies . In contrast , hard rock was most often derived from blues rock and was played louder and with more intensity .
At Maecenas ' insistence ( according to the tradition ) Virgil spent the ensuing years ( perhaps 37–29 BC ) on the long didactic hexameter poem called the Georgics ( from Greek , " On Working the Earth " ) which he dedicated to Maecenas . The ostensible theme of the Georgics is instruction in the methods of running a farm . In handling this theme , Virgil follows in the didactic ( " how to " ) tradition of the Greek poet Hesiod 's Works and Days and several works of the later Hellenistic poets . The four books of the Georgics focus respectively on raising crops and trees ( 1 and 2 ) , livestock and horses ( 3 ) , and beekeeping and the qualities of bees ( 4 ) . Well-known passages include the beloved Laus Italiae of Book 2 , the prologue description of the temple in Book 3 , and the description of the plague at the end of Book 3 . Book 4 concludes with a long mythological narrative , in the form of an epyllion which describes vividly the discovery of beekeeping by Aristaeus and the story of Orpheus ' journey to the underworld . Ancient scholars , such as Servius , conjectured that the Aristaeus episode replaced , at the emperor 's request , a long section in praise of Virgil 's friend , the poet Gallus , who was disgraced by Augustus , and who committed suicide in 26 BC .
While the number of cardinals was small from the times of the Roman Empire to the Renaissance , and frequently smaller than the number of recognized churches entitled to a cardinal priest , in the 16th century the College expanded markedly . In 1587 , Pope Sixtus V sought to arrest this growth by fixing the maximum size of the College at 70 , including 50 cardinal priests , about twice the historical number . This limit was respected until 1958 , and the list of titular churches modified only on rare occasions , generally when a building fell into disrepair . When Pope John XXIII abolished the limit , he began to add new churches to the list , which Popes Paul VI and John Paul II continued to do . Today there are close to 150 titular churches , out of over 300 churches in Rome .
The City Council ( Gemeinderat ) constitutes the executive government of the City of Bern and operates as a collegiate authority . It is composed of five councilors ( German : Gemeinderat/-rätin ) , each presiding over a directorate ( Direktion ) comprising several departments and bureaus . The president of the executive department acts as mayor ( Stadtpräsident ) . In the mandate period 2013–2016 ( Legislatur ) the City Council is presided by Stadtpräsident Alexander Tschäppät . Departmental tasks , coordination measures and implementation of laws decreed by the City Parliament are carried by the City Council . The regular election of the City Council by any inhabitant valid to vote is held every four years . Any resident of Bern allowed to vote can be elected as a member of the City Council . The delegates are selected by means of a system of Majorz . The mayor is elected as such as well by public election while the heads of the other directorates are assigned by the collegiate . The executive body holds its meetings in the Erlacherhof , built by architect Albrecht Stürler after 1747 .
The Aeneid appears to have been a great success . Virgil is said to have recited Books 2 , 4 , and 6 to Augustus ; and Book 6 apparently caused Augustus ' sister Octavia to faint . Although the truth of this claim is subject to scholarly scepticism , it has served as a basis for later art , such as Jean-Baptiste Wicar 's Virgil Reading the Aeneid .
The plan stated that the following numbers of species of different groups had been recorded from Egypt : algae ( 1483 species ) , animals ( about 15,000 species of which more than 10,000 were insects ) , fungi ( more than 627 species ) , monera ( 319 species ) , plants ( 2426 species ) , protozoans ( 371 species ) . For some major groups , for example lichen-forming fungi and nematode worms , the number was not known . Apart from small and well-studied groups like amphibians , birds , fish , mammals and reptiles , the many of those numbers are likely to increase as further species are recorded from Egypt . For the fungi , including lichen-forming species , for example , subsequent work has shown that over 2200 species have been recorded from Egypt , and the final figure of all fungi actually occurring in the country is expected to be much higher .
At the end of this speech , Luther raised his arm " in the traditional salute of a knight winning a bout . " Michael Mullett considers this speech as a " world classic of epoch-making oratory . "
CBS provided digital streams of the game via CBSSports.com , and the CBS Sports apps on tablets , Windows 10 , Xbox One and other digital media players ( such as Chromecast and Roku ) . Due to Verizon Communications exclusivity , streaming on smartphones was only provided to Verizon Wireless customers via the NFL Mobile service . The ESPN Deportes Spanish broadcast was made available through WatchESPN .
At the time of the fall of the Egyptian monarchy in the early 1950s , less than half a million Egyptians were considered upper class and rich , four million middle class and 17 million lower class and poor . Fewer than half of all primary-school-age children attended school , most of them being boys . Nasser 's policies changed this . Land reform and distribution , the dramatic growth in university education , and government support to national industries greatly improved social mobility and flattened the social curve . From academic year 1953-54 through 1965-66 , overall public school enrolments more than doubled . Millions of previously poor Egyptians , through education and jobs in the public sector , joined the middle class . Doctors , engineers , teachers , lawyers , journalists , constituted the bulk of the swelling middle class in Egypt under Nasser . During the 1960s , the Egyptian economy went from sluggish to the verge of collapse , the society became less free , and Nasser 's appeal waned considerably .
In January 2009 President Barack Obama restored US funding to UNFPA , saying in a public statement that he would " look forward to working with Congress to restore US financial support for the UN Population Fund . By resuming funding to UNFPA , the US will be joining 180 other donor nations working collaboratively to reduce poverty , improve the health of women and children , prevent HIV/AIDS and provide family planning assistance to women in 154 countries . "
BSkyB 's direct-to-home satellite service became available in 10 million homes in 2010 , Europe 's first pay-TV platform in to achieve that milestone . Confirming it had reached its target , the broadcaster said its reach into 36 % of households in the UK represented an audience of more than 25m people . The target was first announced in August 2004 , since then an additional 2.4m customers had subscribed to BSkyB 's direct-to-home service . Media commentators had debated whether the figure could be reached as the growth in subscriber numbers elsewhere in Europe flattened .
The permanent headquarters of the Arab League are located in Cairo and the body 's secretary general has traditionally been Egyptian . This position is currently held by former foreign minister Nabil el-Araby . The Arab League briefly moved from Egypt to Tunis in 1978 to protest the Egypt-Israel Peace Treaty , but it later returned to Cairo in 1989 . Gulf monarchies , including the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia , have pledged billions of dollars to help Egypt overcome its economic difficulties since the July 2013 coup .
In the 1530s and 1540s , printed images of Luther that emphasized his monumental size were crucial to the spread of Protestantism . In contrast to images of frail Catholic saints , Luther was presented as a stout man with a " double chin , strong mouth , piercing deep-set eyes , fleshy face , and squat neck . " He was shown to be physically imposing , an equal in stature to the secular German princes with whom he would join forces to spread Lutheranism . His large body also let the viewer know that he did not shun earthly pleasures like drinking—behavior that was a stark contrast to the ascetic life of the medieval religious orders . Famous images from this period include the woodcuts by Hans Brosamer ( 1530 ) and Lucas Cranach the Elder and Lucas Cranach the Younger ( 1546 ) .
In 1516 , Johann Tetzel , a Dominican friar and papal commissioner for indulgences , was sent to Germany by the Roman Catholic Church to sell indulgences to raise money to rebuild St. Peter 's Basilica in Rome . Roman Catholic theology stated that faith alone , whether fiduciary or dogmatic , can not justify man ; justification rather depends only on such faith as is active in charity and good works ( fides caritate formata ) . The benefits of good works could be obtained by donating money to the church .
Luther 's 1538 hymnic version of the Lord 's Prayer , " Vater unser im Himmelreich " , corresponds exactly to Luther 's explanation of the prayer in the Small Catechism , with one stanza for each of the seven prayer petitions , plus opening and closing stanzas . The hymn functioned both as a liturgical setting of the Lord 's Prayer and as a means of examining candidates on specific catechism questions . The extant manuscript shows multiple revisions , demonstrating Luther 's concern to clarify and strengthen the text and to provide an appropriately prayerful tune . Other 16th- and 20th-century versifications of the Lord 's Prayer have adopted Luther 's tune , although modern texts are considerably shorter .
In the United Kingdom , BBC Radio 5 Live and 5 Live Sports Extra will carry the contest . The BBC will carry its own British English broadcast , with Greg Brady , Darren Fletcher and Rocky Boiman on commentary .
The term cardinal at one time applied to any priest permanently assigned or incardinated to a church , or specifically to the senior priest of an important church , based on the Latin cardo ( hinge ) , meaning " principal " or " chief " . The term was applied in this sense as early as the ninth century to the priests of the tituli ( parishes ) of the diocese of Rome . The Church of England retains an instance of this origin of the title , which is held by the two senior members of the College of Minor Canons of St Paul 's Cathedral .
In 1507 , he was ordained to the priesthood , and in 1508 , von Staupitz , first dean of the newly founded University of Wittenberg , sent for Luther , to teach theology . He received a bachelor 's degree in Biblical studies on 9 March 1508 , and another bachelor 's degree in the Sentences by Peter Lombard in 1509 .
Carolina suffered a major setback when Thomas Davis , an 11-year veteran who had already overcome three ACL tears in his career , went down with a broken arm in the NFC Championship Game . Despite this , he insisted he would still find a way to play in the Super Bowl . His prediction turned out to be accurate .

To view the encrypted content a VideoGuard UK equipped receiver ( all of which are dedicated to the Sky service , and can not be used to decrypt other services ) needs to be used . Unofficial CAMs are now available to view the service , although use of them breaks the user 's contract with Sky and invalidates the user 's rights to use the card .
Luther was a prolific hymn-writer , authoring hymns such as " Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott " ( " A Mighty Fortress Is Our God " ) , based on Psalm 46 , and " Vom Himmel hoch , da komm ich her " ( " From Heaven Above to Earth I Come " ) , based on Luke 2:11–12 . Luther connected high art and folk music , also all classes , clergy and laity , men , women and children . His tool of choice for this connection was the singing of German hymns in connection with worship , school , home , and the public arena . He often accompanied the sung hymns with a lute , later recreated as the waldzither that became a national instrument of Germany in the 20th century .
In the United States , the game was televised by CBS , as part of a cycle between the three main broadcast television partners of the NFL . The network 's lead broadcast team of Jim Nantz and Phil Simms called the contest , with Tracy Wolfson and Evan Washburn on the sidelines . CBS introduced new features during the telecast , including pylon cameras and microphones along with EyeVision 360—an array of 36 cameras along the upper deck that can be used to provide a 360-degree view of plays and " bullet time " effects . ( An earlier version of EyeVision was last used in Super Bowl XXXV ; for Super Bowl 50 , the cameras were upgraded to 5K resolution . )

Alloys of primarily zinc with small amounts of copper , aluminium , and magnesium are useful in die casting as well as spin casting , especially in the automotive , electrical , and hardware industries . These alloys are marketed under the name Zamak . An example of this is zinc aluminium . The low melting point together with the low viscosity of the alloy makes the production of small and intricate shapes possible . The low working temperature leads to rapid cooling of the cast products and therefore fast assembly is possible . Another alloy , marketed under the brand name Prestal , contains 78 % zinc and 22 % aluminium and is reported to be nearly as strong as steel but as malleable as plastic . This superplasticity of the alloy allows it to be molded using die casts made of ceramics and cement .
Due to the Ottoman slave trade that had flourished in the Balkans , the coastal town of Ulcinj in Montenegro had its own black community . As a consequence of the slave trade and privateer activity , it is told how until 1878 in Ulcinj 100 black people lived . The Ottoman Army also deployed an estimated 30,000 Black African troops and cavalrymen to its expedition in Hungary during the Austro-Turkish War of 1716–18 .
Distinctive and self-identified black communities have been reported in countries such as Iraq , with a reported 1.2 million black people , and they attest to a history of discrimination . African-Iraquis have sought minority status from the government , which would reserve some seats in Parliament for representatives of their population . According to Alamin M. Mazrui et al. , generally in the Arabian Peninsula and neighboring countries , most of those of visible African descent are still classified and identify as Arab , not black .
Jethro Burns , best known as half of the comedy duo Homer and Jethro , was also the first important jazz mandolinist . Tiny Moore popularized the mandolin in Western swing music . He initially played an 8-string Gibson but switched after 1952 to a 5-string solidbody electric instrument built by Paul Bigsby . Modern players David Grisman , Sam Bush , and Mike Marshall , among others , have worked since the early 1970s to demonstrate the mandolin 's versatility for all styles of music . Chris Thile of California is a well-known player , and has accomplished many feats of traditional bluegrass , classical , contemporary pop and rock ; the band Nickel Creek featured his playing in its blend of traditional and pop styles , and he now plays in his band Punch Brothers . Most commonly associated with bluegrass , mandolin has been used a lot in country music over the years . Some well-known players include Marty Stuart , Vince Gill , and Ricky Skaggs .
Zinc deficiency is crop plants ' most common micronutrient deficiency ; it is particularly common in high-pH soils . Zinc-deficient soil is cultivated in the cropland of about half of Turkey and India , a third of China , and most of Western Australia , and substantial responses to zinc fertilization have been reported in these areas . Plants that grow in soils that are zinc-deficient are more susceptible to disease . Zinc is primarily added to the soil through the weathering of rocks , but humans have added zinc through fossil fuel combustion , mine waste , phosphate fertilizers , pesticide ( zinc phosphide ) , limestone , manure , sewage sludge , and particles from galvanized surfaces . Excess zinc is toxic to plants , although zinc toxicity is far less widespread .
Although one of the main obstacles still facing the Egyptian economy is the limited trickle down of wealth to the average population , many Egyptians criticise their government for higher prices of basic goods while their standards of living or purchasing power remains relatively stagnant . Corruption is often cited by Egyptians as the main impediment to further economic growth . The government promised major reconstruction of the country 's infrastructure , using money paid for the newly acquired third mobile license ( $ 3 billion ) by Etisalat in 2006 . In the Corruption Perceptions Index 2013 , Egypt was ranked 114 out of 177 .
If conditions change , so that the pope judges it safe to make the appointment public , he may do so at any time . The cardinal in question then ranks in precedence with those raised to the cardinalate at the time of his in pectore appointment . If a pope dies before revealing the identity of an in pectore cardinal , the cardinalate expires .
Similar alloys with the addition of a small amount of lead can be cold-rolled into sheets . An alloy of 96 % zinc and 4 % aluminium is used to make stamping dies for low production run applications for which ferrous metal dies would be too expensive . In building facades , roofs or other applications in which zinc is used as sheet metal and for methods such as deep drawing , roll forming or bending , zinc alloys with titanium and copper are used . Unalloyed zinc is too brittle for these kinds of manufacturing processes .
The Aeneid is widely considered Virgil 's finest work and one of the most important poems in the history of western literature . Virgil worked on the Aeneid during the last eleven years of his life ( 29–19 BC ) , commissioned , according to Propertius , by Augustus . The epic poem consists of 12 books in dactylic hexameter verse which describe the journey of Aeneas , a warrior fleeing the sack of Troy , to Italy , his battle with the Italian prince Turnus , and the foundation of a city from which Rome would emerge . The Aeneid 's first six books describe the journey of Aeneas from Troy to Rome . Virgil made use of several models in the composition of his epic ; Homer , the preeminent author of classical epic , is everywhere present , but Virgil also makes special use of the Latin poet Ennius and the Hellenistic poet Apollonius of Rhodes among the various other writers to which he alludes . Although the Aeneid casts itself firmly into the epic mode , it often seeks to expand the genre by including elements of other genres such as tragedy and aetiological poetry . Ancient commentators noted that Virgil seems to divide the Aeneid into two sections based on the poetry of Homer ; the first six books were viewed as employing the Odyssey as a model while the last six were connected to the Iliad .
Luther and his wife moved into a former monastery , " The Black Cloister , " a wedding present from the new elector John the Steadfast ( 1525–32 ) . They embarked on what appeared to have been a happy and successful marriage , though money was often short . Between bearing six children , Hans – June 1526 ; Elizabeth – 10 December 1527 , who died within a few months ; Magdalene – 1529 , who died in Luther 's arms in 1542 ; Martin – 1531 ; Paul – January 1533 ; and Margaret – 1534 ; Katharina helped the couple earn a living by farming the land and taking in boarders . Luther confided to Michael Stiefel on 11 August 1526 : " My Katie is in all things so obliging and pleasing to me that I would not exchange my poverty for the riches of Croesus . "
The mandolin has been used extensively in the traditional music of England and Scotland for generations . Simon Mayor is a prominent British player who has produced six solo albums , instructional books and DVDs , as well as recordings with his mandolin quartet the Mandolinquents . The instrument has also found its way into British rock music . The mandolin was played by Mike Oldfield ( and introduced by Vivian Stanshall ) on Oldfield 's album Tubular Bells , as well as on a number of his subsequent albums ( particularly prominently on Hergest Ridge ( 1974 ) and Ommadawn ( 1975 ) ) . It was used extensively by the British folk-rock band Lindisfarne , who featured two members on the instrument , Ray Jackson and Simon Cowe , and whose " Fog on the Tyne " was the biggest selling UK album of 1971-1972 . The instrument was also used extensively in the UK folk revival of the 1960s and 1970s with bands such as Fairport Convention and Steeleye Span taking it on as the lead instrument in many of their songs . Maggie May by Rod Stewart , which hit No . 1 on both the British charts and the Billboard Hot 100 , also featured Jackson 's playing . It has also been used by other British rock musicians . Led Zeppelin 's bassist John Paul Jones is an accomplished mandolin player and has recorded numerous songs on mandolin including Going to California and That 's the Way ; the mandolin part on The Battle of Evermore is played by Jimmy Page , who composed the song . Other Led Zeppelin songs featuring mandolin are Hey Hey What Can I Do , and Black Country Woman . Pete Townshend of The Who played mandolin on the track Mike Post Theme , along with many other tracks on Endless Wire . McGuinness Flint , for whom Graham Lyle played the mandolin on their most successful single , When I 'm Dead And Gone , is another example . Lyle was also briefly a member of Ronnie Lane 's Slim Chance , and played mandolin on their hit How Come . One of the more prominent early mandolin players in popular music was Robin Williamson in The Incredible String Band . Ian Anderson of Jethro Tull is a highly accomplished mandolin player ( beautiful track Pussy Willow ) , as is his guitarist Martin Barre . The popular song Please Please Please Let Me Get What I Want by The Smiths featured a mandolin solo played by Johnny Marr . More recently , the Glasgow-based band Sons and Daughters featured the mandolin , played by Ailidh Lennon , on tracks such as Fight , Start to End , and Medicine . British folk-punk icons the Levellers also regularly use the mandolin in their songs . Current bands are also beginning to use the Mandolin and its unique sound - such as South London 's Indigo Moss who use it throughout their recordings and live gigs . The mandolin has also featured in the playing of Matthew Bellamy in the rock band Muse . It also forms the basis of Paul McCartney 's 2007 hit " Dance Tonight . " That was not the first time a Beatle played a mandolin , however ; that distinction goes to George Harrison on Gone Troppo , the title cut from the 1982 album of the same name . The mandolin is taught in Lanarkshire by the Lanarkshire Guitar and Mandolin Association to over 100 people . Also more recently hard rock supergroup Them Crooked Vultures have been playing a song based primarily using a mandolin . This song was left off their debut album , and features former Led Zeppelin bassist John Paul Jones . [ citation needed ]
Egypt 's economy depends mainly on agriculture , media , petroleum imports , natural gas , and tourism ; there are also more than three million Egyptians working abroad , mainly in Saudi Arabia , the Persian Gulf and Europe . The completion of the Aswan High Dam in 1970 and the resultant Lake Nasser have altered the time-honored place of the Nile River in the agriculture and ecology of Egypt . A rapidly growing population , limited arable land , and dependence on the Nile all continue to overtax resources and stress the economy .
Emerging British acts included Free , who released their signature song " All Right Now " ( 1970 ) , which has received extensive radio airplay in both the UK and US . After the breakup of the band in 1973 , vocalist Paul Rodgers joined supergroup Bad Company , whose eponymous first album ( 1974 ) was an international hit . The mixture of hard rock and progressive rock , evident in the works of Deep Purple , was pursued more directly by bands like Uriah Heep and Argent . Scottish band Nazareth released their self-titled début album in 1971 , producing a blend of hard rock and pop that would culminate in their best selling , Hair of the Dog ( 1975 ) , which contained the proto-power ballad " Love Hurts " . Having enjoyed some national success in the early 1970s , Queen , after the release of Sheer Heart Attack ( 1974 ) and A Night at the Opera ( 1975 ) , gained international recognition with a sound that used layered vocals and guitars and mixed hard rock with heavy metal , progressive rock , and even opera . The latter featured the single " Bohemian Rhapsody " , which stayed at number one in the UK charts for nine weeks .
Six-time Grammy winner and Academy Award nominee Lady Gaga performed the national anthem , while Academy Award winner Marlee Matlin provided American Sign Language ( ASL ) translation .
Super Bowl 50 featured numerous records from individuals and teams . Denver won despite being massively outgained in total yards ( 315 to 194 ) and first downs ( 21 to 11 ) . Their 194 yards and 11 first downs were both the lowest totals ever by a Super Bowl winning team . The previous record was 244 yards by the Baltimore Ravens in Super Bowl XXXV . Only seven other teams had ever gained less than 200 yards in a Super Bowl , and all of them had lost . The Broncos ' seven sacks tied a Super Bowl record set by the Chicago Bears in Super Bowl XX . Kony Ealy tied a Super Bowl record with three sacks . Jordan Norwood 's 61-yard punt return set a new record , surpassing the old record of 45 yards set by John Taylor in Super Bowl XXIII . Denver was just 1-of-14 on third down , while Carolina was barely better at 3-of-15 . The two teams ' combined third down conversion percentage of 13.8 was a Super Bowl low . Manning and Newton had quarterback passer ratings of 56.6 and 55.4 , respectively , and their added total of 112 is a record lowest aggregate passer rating for a Super Bowl . Manning became the oldest quarterback ever to win a Super Bowl at age 39 , and the first quarterback ever to win a Super Bowl with two different teams , while Gary Kubiak became the first head coach to win a Super Bowl with the same franchise he went to the Super Bowl with as a player .
UNFPA provided aid to Peru 's reproductive health program in the mid-to-late '90s . When it was discovered a Peruvian program had been engaged in carrying out coercive sterilizations , UNFPA called for reforms and protocols to protect the rights of women seeking assistance . UNFPA was not involved in the scandal , but continued work with the country after the abuses had become public to help end the abuses and reform laws and practices .
The new government drafted and implemented a constitution in 1923 based on a parliamentary system . Saad Zaghlul was popularly elected as Prime Minister of Egypt in 1924 . In 1936 , the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty was concluded . Continued instability due to remaining British influence and increasing political involvement by the king led to the dissolution of the parliament in a military coup d'état known as the 1952 Revolution . The Free Officers Movement forced King Farouk to abdicate in support of his son Fuad . British military presence in Egypt lasted until 1954 .
The Broncos ' defense ranked first in the NFL yards allowed ( 4,530 ) for the first time in franchise history , and fourth in points allowed ( 296 ) .

Cornerbacks Aqib Talib ( three interceptions ) and Chris Harris , Jr. ( two interceptions ) were the other two Pro Bowl selections from the defense .
In response to demands for a German liturgy , Luther wrote a German Mass , which he published in early 1526 . He did not intend it as a replacement for his 1523 adaptation of the Latin Mass but as an alternative for the " simple people " , a " public stimulation for people to believe and become Christians . " Luther based his order on the Catholic service but omitted " everything that smacks of sacrifice " ; and the Mass became a celebration where everyone received the wine as well as the bread . He retained the elevation of the host and chalice , while trappings such as the Mass vestments , altar , and candles were made optional , allowing freedom of ceremony . Some reformers , including followers of Huldrych Zwingli , considered Luther 's service too papistic ; and modern scholars note the conservatism of his alternative to the Catholic mass . Luther 's service , however , included congregational singing of hymns and psalms in German , as well as of parts of the liturgy , including Luther 's unison setting of the Creed . To reach the simple people and the young , Luther incorporated religious instruction into the weekday services in the form of the catechism . He also provided simplified versions of the baptism and marriage services .
The term " retro-metal " has been applied to such bands as Texas based The Sword , California 's High on Fire , Sweden 's Witchcraft and Australia 's Wolfmother . Wolfmother 's self-titled 2005 debut album combined elements of the sounds of Deep Purple and Led Zeppelin . Fellow Australians Airbourne 's début album Runnin ' Wild ( 2007 ) followed in the hard riffing tradition of AC/DC . England 's The Darkness ' Permission to Land ( 2003 ) , described as an " eerily realistic simulation of '80s metal and '70s glam " , topped the UK charts , going quintuple platinum . The follow-up , One Way Ticket to Hell ... and Back ( 2005 ) , reached number 11 , before the band broke up in 2006 . Los Angeles band Steel Panther managed to gain a following by sending up 80s glam metal . A more serious attempt to revive glam metal was made by bands of the sleaze metal movement in Sweden , including Vains of Jenna , Hardcore Superstar and Crashdïet .

Although Foo Fighters continued to be one of the most successful rock acts , with albums like In Your Honor ( 2005 ) reaching number two in the US and UK , many of the first wave of post-grunge bands began to fade in popularity . Acts like Creed , Staind , Puddle of Mudd and Nickelback took the genre into the 2000s with considerable commercial success , abandoning most of the angst and anger of the original movement for more conventional anthems , narratives and romantic songs . They were followed in this vein by new acts including Shinedown and Seether . Acts with more conventional hard rock sounds included Andrew W.K. , Beautiful Creatures and Buckcherry , whose breakthrough album 15 ( 2006 ) went platinum and spawned the single " Sorry " ( 2007 ) , which made the Top 10 of the Billboard 100 . These were joined by bands with hard rock leanings that emerged in the mid-2000s from the garage rock or post punk revival , including Black Rebel Motorcycle Club and Kings of Leon , and Queens of the Stone Age from the US , Three Days Grace from Canada , Jet from Australia and The Datsuns from New Zealand . In 2009 Them Crooked Vultures , a supergroup that brought together Foo Fighters ' Dave Grohl , Queens of the Stone Age 's Josh Homme and Led Zeppelin bass player John Paul Jones attracted attention as a live act and released a self-titled debut album that reached the top 20 in the US and UK and the top ten in several other countries .
He insisted that , since forgiveness was God 's alone to grant , those who claimed that indulgences absolved buyers from all punishments and granted them salvation were in error . Christians , he said , must not slacken in following Christ on account of such false assurances .
According to Dr. Carlos Moore , resident scholar at Brazil 's University of the State of Bahia , in the 21st century Afro-multiracials in the Arab world , including Arabs in North Africa , self-identify in ways that resemble multi-racials in Latin America . He claims that black-looking Arabs , much like black-looking Latin Americans , consider themselves white because they have some distant white ancestry .
At the very end of the 19th century , a new style , with a carved top and back construction inspired by violin family instruments began to supplant the European-style bowl-back instruments in the United States . This new style is credited to mandolins designed and built by Orville Gibson , a Kalamazoo , Michigan luthier who founded the " Gibson Mandolin-Guitar Manufacturing Co. , Limited " in 1902 . Gibson mandolins evolved into two basic styles : the Florentine or F-style , which has a decorative scroll near the neck , two points on the lower body and usually a scroll carved into the headstock ; and the A-style , which is pear shaped , has no points and usually has a simpler headstock .
On the other hand , Luther also points out that the Ten Commandments – when considered not as God 's condemning judgment but as an expression of his eternal will , that is , of the natural law – also positively teach how the Christian ought to live . This has traditionally been called the " third use of the law . " For Luther , also Christ 's life , when understood as an example , is nothing more than an illustration of the Ten Commandments , which a Christian should follow in his or her vocations on a daily basis .
In the United States , the game was televised by CBS , as part of a cycle between the three main broadcast television partners of the NFL . The network 's lead broadcast team of Jim Nantz and Phil Simms called the contest , with Tracy Wolfson and Evan Washburn on the sidelines . CBS introduced new features during the telecast , including pylon cameras and microphones along with EyeVision 360—an array of 36 cameras along the upper deck that can be used to provide a 360-degree view of plays and " bullet time " effects . ( An earlier version of EyeVision was last used in Super Bowl XXXV ; for Super Bowl 50 , the cameras were upgraded to 5K resolution . )
In 1988 , the civil rights leader Jesse Jackson urged Americans to use instead the term " African American " because it had a historical cultural base and was a construction similar to terms used by European descendants , such as German American , Italian American , etc . Since then , African American and black have often had parallel status . However , controversy continues over which if any of the two terms is more appropriate . Maulana Karenga argues that the term African-American is more appropriate because it accurately articulates their geographical and historical origin . [ citation needed ] Others have argued that " black " is a better term because " African " suggests foreignness , although Black Americans helped found the United States . Still others believe that the term black is inaccurate because African Americans have a variety of skin tones . Some surveys suggest that the majority of Black Americans have no preference for " African American " or " Black " , although they have a slight preference for " black " in personal settings and " African American " in more formal settings .
On 13 June 1525 , the couple was engaged with Johannes Bugenhagen , Justus Jonas , Johannes Apel , Philipp Melanchthon and Lucas Cranach the Elder and his wife as witnesses . On the evening of the same day , the couple was married by Bugenhagen . The ceremonial walk to the church and the wedding banquet were left out , and were made up two weeks later on 27 June .
The city of Bern or Berne ( German : Bern , pronounced [ bɛrn ] ( listen ) ; French : Berne [ bɛʁn ] ; Italian : Berna [ ˈbɛrna ] ; Romansh : Berna [ ˈbɛrnɐ ] ( help·info ) ; Bernese German : Bärn [ b̥æːrn ] ) is the de facto capital of Switzerland , referred to by the Swiss as their ( e.g . in German ) Bundesstadt , or " federal city " . [ note 1 ] With a population of 140,634 ( November 2015 ) , Bern is the fifth most populous city in Switzerland . The Bern agglomeration , which includes 36 municipalities , had a population of 406,900 in 2014 . The metropolitan area had a population of 660,000 in 2000 . Bern is also the capital of the Canton of Bern , the second most populous of Switzerland 's cantons .
The opening years of the 1980s saw a number of changes in personnel and direction of established hard rock acts , including the deaths of Bon Scott , the lead singer of AC/DC , and John Bonham , drummer with Led Zeppelin . Whereas Zeppelin broke up almost immediately afterwards , AC/DC pressed on , recording the album Back in Black ( 1980 ) with their new lead singer , Brian Johnson . It became the fifth-highest-selling album of all time in the US and the second-highest-selling album in the world . Black Sabbath had split with original singer Ozzy Osbourne in 1979 and replaced him with Ronnie James Dio , formerly of Rainbow , giving the band a new sound and a period of creativity and popularity beginning with Heaven and Hell ( 1980 ) . Osbourne embarked on a solo career with Blizzard of Ozz ( 1980 ) , featuring American guitarist Randy Rhoads . Some bands , such as Queen , moved away from their hard rock roots and more towards pop rock , while others , including Rush with Moving Pictures ( 1981 ) , began to return to a hard rock sound . The creation of thrash metal , which mixed heavy metal with elements of hardcore punk from about 1982 , particularly by Metallica , Anthrax , Megadeth and Slayer , helped to create extreme metal and further remove the style from hard rock , although a number of these bands or their members would continue to record some songs closer to a hard rock sound . Kiss moved away from their hard rock roots toward pop metal : firstly removing their makeup in 1983 for their Lick It Up album , and then adopting the visual and sound of glam metal for their 1984 release , Animalize , both of which marked a return to commercial success . Pat Benatar was one of the first women to achieve commercial success in hard rock , with three successive Top 5 albums between 1980 and 1982 .
Luther is honoured on 18 February with a commemoration in the Lutheran Calendar of Saints and in the Episcopal ( United States ) Calendar of Saints . In the Church of England 's Calendar of Saints he is commemorated on 31 October .
There is disagreement about the origin of the term , but general consensus that " cardinalis " from the word cardo ( meaning 'pivot ' or 'hinge ' ) was first used in late antiquity to designate a bishop or priest who was incorporated into a church for which he had not originally been ordained . In Rome the first persons to be called cardinals were the deacons of the seven regions of the city at the beginning of the 6th century , when the word began to mean “ principal , ” “ eminent , ” or " superior . " The name was also given to the senior priest in each of the " title " churches ( the parish churches ) of Rome and to the bishops of the seven sees surrounding the city . By the 8th century the Roman cardinals constituted a privileged class among the Roman clergy . They took part in the administration of the church of Rome and in the papal liturgy . By decree of a synod of 769 , only a cardinal was eligible to become pope . In 1059 , during the pontificate of Nicholas II , cardinals were given the right to elect the pope under the Papal Bull In nomine Domini . For a time this power was assigned exclusively to the cardinal bishops , but the Third Lateran Council in 1179 gave back the right to the whole body of cardinals . Cardinals were granted the privilege of wearing the red hat by Pope Innocent IV in 1244 .
Zinc is an essential mineral perceived by the public today as being of " exceptional biologic and public health importance " , especially regarding prenatal and postnatal development . Zinc deficiency affects about two billion people in the developing world and is associated with many diseases . In children it causes growth retardation , delayed sexual maturation , infection susceptibility , and diarrhea . Enzymes with a zinc atom in the reactive center are widespread in biochemistry , such as alcohol dehydrogenase in humans . Consumption of excess zinc can cause ataxia , lethargy and copper deficiency .
UNFPA is the world 's largest multilateral source of funding for population and reproductive health programs . The Fund works with governments and non-governmental organizations in over 150 countries with the support of the international community , supporting programs that help women , men and young people :
In January 1519 , at Altenburg in Saxony , the papal nuncio Karl von Miltitz adopted a more conciliatory approach . Luther made certain concessions to the Saxon , who was a relative of the Elector , and promised to remain silent if his opponents did . The theologian Johann Eck , however , was determined to expose Luther 's doctrine in a public forum . In June and July 1519 , he staged a disputation with Luther 's colleague Andreas Karlstadt at Leipzig and invited Luther to speak . Luther 's boldest assertion in the debate was that Matthew 16:18 does not confer on popes the exclusive right to interpret scripture , and that therefore neither popes nor church councils were infallible . For this , Eck branded Luther a new Jan Hus , referring to the Czech reformer and heretic burned at the stake in 1415 . From that moment , he devoted himself to Luther 's defeat .
The Marxist critique of capitalism — developed with Friedrich Engels — was , alongside liberalism and fascism , one of the defining ideological movements of the Twentieth Century . The industrial revolution produced a parallel revolution in political thought . Urbanization and capitalism greatly reshaped society . During this same period , the socialist movement began to form . In the mid-19th century , Marxism was developed , and socialism in general gained increasing popular support , mostly from the urban working class . Without breaking entirely from the past , Marx established principles that would be used by future revolutionaries of the 20th century namely Vladimir Lenin , Mao Zedong , Ho Chi Minh , and Fidel Castro . Though Hegel 's philosophy of history is similar to Immanuel Kant 's , and Karl Marx 's theory of revolution towards the common good is partly based on Kant 's view of history—Marx declared that he was turning Hegel 's dialectic , which was " standing on its head " , " the right side up again " . Unlike Marx who believed in historical materialism , Hegel believed in the Phenomenology of Spirit . By the late 19th century , socialism and trade unions were established members of the political landscape . In addition , the various branches of anarchism , with thinkers such as Mikhail Bakunin , Pierre-Joseph Proudhon or Peter Kropotkin , and syndicalism also gained some prominence . In the Anglo-American world , anti-imperialism and pluralism began gaining currency at the turn of the 20th century .
The cardinal who is the longest-serving member of the order of cardinal priests is titled cardinal protopriest . He had certain ceremonial duties in the conclave that have effectively ceased because he would generally have already reached age 80 , at which cardinals are barred from the conclave . The current cardinal protopriest is Paulo Evaristo Arns of Brazil .

The papal bull defining the dogma , Ineffabilis Deus , mentioned in particular the patrististic interpretation of Genesis 3:15 as referring to a woman , Mary , who would be eternally at enmity with the evil serpent and completely triumphing over him . It said the Fathers saw foreshadowings of Mary 's " wondrous abundance of divine gifts and original innocence " " in that ark of Noah , which was built by divine command and escaped entirely safe and sound from the common shipwreck of the whole world ; in the ladder which Jacob saw reaching from the earth to heaven , by whose rungs the angels of God ascended and descended , and on whose top the Lord himself leaned ; in that bush which Moses saw in the holy place burning on all sides , which was not consumed or injured in any way but grew green and blossomed beautifully ; in that impregnable tower before the enemy , from which hung a thousand bucklers and all the armor of the strong ; in that garden enclosed on all sides , which can not be violated or corrupted by any deceitful plots ; in that resplendent city of God , which has its foundations on the holy mountains ; in that most august temple of God , which , radiant with divine splendours , is full of the glory of God ; and in very many other biblical types of this kind . "
UNFPA provided aid to Peru 's reproductive health program in the mid-to-late '90s . When it was discovered a Peruvian program had been engaged in carrying out coercive sterilizations , UNFPA called for reforms and protocols to protect the rights of women seeking assistance . UNFPA was not involved in the scandal , but continued work with the country after the abuses had become public to help end the abuses and reform laws and practices .
At the heart of scholars ' debate about Luther 's influence is whether it is anachronistic to view his work as a precursor of the racial antisemitism of the Nazis . Some scholars see Luther 's influence as limited , and the Nazis ' use of his work as opportunistic . Biographer Martin Brecht points out that " There is a world of difference between his belief in salvation and a racial ideology . Nevertheless , his misguided agitation had the evil result that Luther fatefully became one of the 'church fathers ' of anti-Semitism and thus provided material for the modern hatred of the Jews , cloaking it with the authority of the Reformer . " Johannes Wallmann argues that Luther 's writings against the Jews were largely ignored in the 18th and 19th centuries , and that there was no continuity between Luther 's thought and Nazi ideology . Uwe Siemon-Netto agreed , arguing that it was because the Nazis were already anti-Semites that they revived Luther 's work . Hans J. Hillerbrand agreed that to focus on Luther was to adopt an essentially ahistorical perspective of Nazi antisemitism that ignored other contributory factors in German history . Similarly , Roland Bainton , noted church historian and Luther biographer , wrote " One could wish that Luther had died before ever [ On the Jews and Their Lies ] was written . His position was entirely religious and in no respect racial . "
In the 1960s , American and British blues and rock bands began to modify rock and roll by adding harder sounds , heavier guitar riffs , bombastic drumming , and louder vocals , from electric blues . Early forms of hard rock can be heard in the work of Chicago blues musicians Elmore James , Muddy Waters , and Howlin ' Wolf , The Kingsmen 's version of " Louie Louie " ( 1963 ) which made it a garage rock standard , and the songs of rhythm and blues influenced British Invasion acts , including " You Really Got Me " by The Kinks ( 1964 ) , " My Generation " by The Who ( 1965 ) , " Shapes of Things " ( 1966 ) by The Yardbirds and " ( I Ca n't Get No ) Satisfaction " ( 1965 ) by The Rolling Stones . From the late 1960s , it became common to divide mainstream rock music that emerged from psychedelia into soft and hard rock . Soft rock was often derived from folk rock , using acoustic instruments and putting more emphasis on melody and harmonies . In contrast , hard rock was most often derived from blues rock and was played louder and with more intensity .
Laing 's definition of identity closely follows Erikson 's , in emphasising the past , present and future components of the experienced self . He also develops the concept of the " metaperspective of self " , i.e . the self 's perception of the other 's view of self , which has been found to be extremely important in clinical contexts such as anorexia nervosa . ( Saunderson and O'Kane , 2005 ) . Harré also conceptualises components of self/identity – the " person " ( the unique being I am to myself and others ) along with aspects of self ( including a totality of attributes including beliefs about one 's characteristics including life history ) , and the personal characteristics displayed to others .
Muhammad Ali Pasha evolved the military from one that convened under the tradition of the corvée to a great modernised army . He introduced conscription of the male peasantry in 19th century Egypt , and took a novel approach to create his great army , strengthening it with numbers and in skill . Education and training of the new soldiers was not an option ; the new concepts were furthermore enforced by isolation . The men were held in barracks to avoid distraction of their growth as a military unit to be reckoned with . The resentment for the military way of life eventually faded from the men and a new ideology took hold , one of nationalism and pride . It was with the help of this newly reborn martial unit that Muhammad Ali imposed his rule over Egypt .
Luther justified his opposition to the rebels on three grounds . First , in choosing violence over lawful submission to the secular government , they were ignoring Christ 's counsel to " Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar 's " ; St. Paul had written in his epistle to the Romans 13:1–7 that all authorities are appointed by God and therefore should not be resisted . This reference from the Bible forms the foundation for the doctrine known as the Divine Right of Kings , or , in the German case , the divine right of the princes . Second , the violent actions of rebelling , robbing , and plundering placed the peasants " outside the law of God and Empire " , so they deserved " death in body and soul , if only as highwaymen and murderers . " Lastly , Luther charged the rebels with blasphemy for calling themselves " Christian brethren " and committing their sinful acts under the banner of the Gospel .
Most of Egypt 's rain falls in the winter months . South of Cairo , rainfall averages only around 2 to 5 mm ( 0.1 to 0.2 in ) per year and at intervals of many years . On a very thin strip of the northern coast the rainfall can be as high as 410 mm ( 16.1 in ) , mostly between October and March . Snow falls on Sinai 's mountains and some of the north coastal cities such as Damietta , Baltim , Sidi Barrany , etc . and rarely in Alexandria . A very small amount of snow fell on Cairo on 13 December 2013 , the first time Cairo received snowfall in many decades . Frost is also known in mid-Sinai and mid-Egypt . Egypt is the driest and the sunniest country in the world , and most of its land surface is desert .
Peyton Manning became the first quarterback ever to lead two different teams to multiple Super Bowls . He is also the oldest quarterback ever to play in a Super Bowl at age 39 . The past record was held by John Elway , who led the Broncos to victory in Super Bowl XXXIII at age 38 and is currently Denver 's Executive Vice President of Football Operations and General Manager .
Luther is honoured on 18 February with a commemoration in the Lutheran Calendar of Saints and in the Episcopal ( United States ) Calendar of Saints . In the Church of England 's Calendar of Saints he is commemorated on 31 October .
According to the tradition , Virgil traveled to Greece in about 19 BC to revise the Aeneid . After meeting Augustus in Athens and deciding to return home , Virgil caught a fever while visiting a town near Megara . After crossing to Italy by ship , weakened with disease , Virgil died in Brundisium harbor on September 21 , 19 BC . Augustus ordered Virgil 's literary executors , Lucius Varius Rufus and Plotius Tucca , to disregard Virgil 's own wish that the poem be burned , instead ordering it published with as few editorial changes as possible . As a result , the text of the Aeneid that exists may contain faults which Virgil was planning to correct before publication . However , the only obvious imperfections are a few lines of verse that are metrically unfinished ( i.e . not a complete line of dactylic hexameter ) . Some scholars have argued that Virgil deliberately left these metrically incomplete lines for dramatic effect . Other alleged imperfections are subject to scholarly debate .
In January 2009 President Barack Obama restored US funding to UNFPA , saying in a public statement that he would " look forward to working with Congress to restore US financial support for the UN Population Fund . By resuming funding to UNFPA , the US will be joining 180 other donor nations working collaboratively to reduce poverty , improve the health of women and children , prevent HIV/AIDS and provide family planning assistance to women in 154 countries . "
Sandra Laing is a South African woman who was classified as Coloured by authorities during the apartheid era , due to her skin colour and hair texture , although her parents could prove at least three generations of European ancestors . At age 10 , she was expelled from her all-white school . The officials ' decisions based on her anomalous appearance disrupted her family and adult life . She was the subject of the 2008 biographical dramatic film Skin , which won numerous awards .

The annual NFL Experience was held at the Moscone Center in San Francisco . In addition , " Super Bowl City " opened on January 30 at Justin Herman Plaza on The Embarcadero , featuring games and activities that will highlight the Bay Area 's technology , culinary creations , and cultural diversity . More than 1 million people are expected to attend the festivities in San Francisco during Super Bowl Week . San Francisco mayor Ed Lee said of the highly visible homeless presence in this area " they are going to have to leave " . San Francisco city supervisor Jane Kim unsuccessfully lobbied for the NFL to reimburse San Francisco for city services in the amount of $ 5 million .
The Panthers seemed primed to score on their opening drive of the second half when Newton completed a 45-yard pass to Ted Ginn Jr. on the Denver 35-yard line on their second offensive play . But the Broncos defense halted the drive on the 26-yard line , and it ended with no points when Graham Gano hit the uprights on a 44-yard field goal attempt . After the miss , Manning completed a pair of passes to Emmanuel Sanders for gains of 25 and 22 yards , setting up McManus ' 33-yard field goal that gave the Broncos a 16–7 lead . Carolina got off to another strong start after the kickoff , with Newton completing a 42-yard pass to Corey Brown . But once again they came up empty , this time as a result of a Newton pass that bounced off the hands of Ginn and was intercepted by safety T. J . Ward . Ward fumbled the ball during the return , but Trevathan recovered it to enable Denver to keep possession .
The Romans interacted with and later conquered parts of Mauretania , an early state that covered modern Morocco , western Algeria , and the Spanish cities Ceuta and Melilla during the classical period . The people of the region were noted in Classical literature as Mauri , which was subsequently rendered as Moors in English .
In the early 1970s the Rolling Stones developed their hard rock sound with Exile on Main St. ( 1972 ) . Initially receiving mixed reviews , according to critic Steve Erlewine it is now " generally regarded as the Rolling Stones ' finest album " . They continued to pursue the riff-heavy sound on albums including It 's Only Rock 'n ' Roll ( 1974 ) and Black and Blue ( 1976 ) . Led Zeppelin began to mix elements of world and folk music into their hard rock from Led Zeppelin III ( 1970 ) and Led Zeppelin IV ( 1971 ) . The latter included the track " Stairway to Heaven " , which would become the most played song in the history of album-oriented radio . Deep Purple continued to define hard rock , particularly with their album Machine Head ( 1972 ) , which included the tracks " Highway Star " and " Smoke on the Water " . In 1975 guitarist Ritchie Blackmore left , going on to form Rainbow and after the break-up of the band the next year , vocalist David Coverdale formed Whitesnake . 1970 saw The Who release Live at Leeds , often seen as the archetypal hard rock live album , and the following year they released their highly acclaimed album Who 's Next , which mixed heavy rock with extensive use of synthesizers . Subsequent albums , including Quadrophenia ( 1973 ) , built on this sound before Who Are You ( 1978 ) , their last album before the death of pioneering rock drummer Keith Moon later that year .
Carolina suffered a major setback when Thomas Davis , an 11-year veteran who had already overcome three ACL tears in his career , went down with a broken arm in the NFC Championship Game . Despite this , he insisted he would still find a way to play in the Super Bowl . His prediction turned out to be accurate .
In the year 1563 the influential Ecumenical Council of Trent , headed by Pope Pius IV , wrote about the importance of selecting good Cardinals . According to this historic council " nothing is more necessary to the Church of God than that the holy Roman pontiff apply that solicitude which by the duty of his office he owes the universal Church in a very special way by associating with himself as cardinals the most select persons only , and appoint to each church most eminently upright and competent shepherds ; and this the more so , because our Lord Jesus Christ will require at his hands the blood of the sheep of Christ that perish through the evil government of shepherds who are negligent and forgetful of their office . "
The flagship stations of each station in the markets of each team will carry their local play-by-play calls . In Denver , KOA ( 850 AM ) and KRFX ( 103.5 FM ) will carry the game , with Dave Logan on play-by-play and Ed McCaffrey on color commentary . In North Carolina , WBT ( 1110 AM ) will carry the game , with Mick Mixon on play-by-play and Eugene Robinson and Jim Szoke on color commentary . WBT will also simulcast the game on its sister station WBT-FM ( 99.3 FM ) , which is based in Chester , South Carolina . As KOA and WBT are both clear-channel stations , the local broadcasts will be audible over much of the western United States after sunset ( for Denver ) and the eastern United States throughout the game ( for Carolina ) . In accordance with contractual rules , the rest of the stations in the Broncos and Panthers radio networks will either carry the Westwood One feed or not carry the game at all .
Various gold-themed promotions and initiatives were held throughout the 2015 NFL season to tie into the " Golden Super Bowl " ; gold-tinted logos were implemented across the NFL 's properties and painted on fields , the numbering of the 50-yard line on fields was colored gold , and beginning on week 7 , all sideline jackets and hats featured gold-trimmed logos . Gold footballs were given to each high school that has had a player or coach appear in the Super Bowl , and " homecoming " events were also held by Super Bowl-winning teams at games .
The Charaka Samhita , thought to have been written between 300 and 500 AD , mentions a metal which , when oxidized , produces pushpanjan , thought to be zinc oxide . Zinc mines at Zawar , near Udaipur in India , have been active since the Mauryan period . The smelting of metallic zinc here , however , appears to have begun around the 12th century AD . One estimate is that this location produced an estimated million tonnes of metallic zinc and zinc oxide from the 12th to 16th centuries . Another estimate gives a total production of 60,000 tonnes of metallic zinc over this period . The Rasaratna Samuccaya , written in approximately the 13th century AD , mentions two types of zinc-containing ores : one used for metal extraction and another used for medicinal purposes .
The international repertoire of music for mandolin is almost unlimited , and musicians use it to play various types of music . This is especially true of violin music , since the mandolin has the same tuning of the violin . Following its invention and early development in Italy the mandolin spread throughout the European continent . The instrument was primarily used in a classical tradition with Mandolin orchestras , so called Estudiantinas or in Germany Zupforchestern appearing in many cities . Following this continental popularity of the mandolin family local traditions appeared outside of Europe in the Americas and in Japan . Travelling mandolin virtuosi like Giuseppe Pettine , Raffaele Calace and Silvio Ranieri contributed to the mandolin becoming a " fad " instrument in the early 20th century . This " mandolin craze " was fading by the 1930s , but just as this practice was falling into disuse , the mandolin found a new niche in American country , old-time music , bluegrass and folk music . More recently , the Baroque and Classical mandolin repertory and styles have benefited from the raised awareness of and interest in Early music , with media attention to classical players such as Israeli Avi Avital , Italian Carlo Aonzo and American Joseph Brent .
The first favours a primordialist approach which takes the sense of self and belonging to a collective group as a fixed thing , defined by objective criteria such as common ancestry and common biological characteristics . The second , rooted in social constructionist theory , takes the view that identity is formed by a predominantly political choice of certain characteristics . In so doing , it questions the idea that identity is a natural given , characterised by fixed , supposedly objective criteria . Both approaches need to be understood in their respective political and historical contexts , characterised by debate on issues of class , race and ethnicity . While they have been criticized , they continue to exert an influence on approaches to the conceptualisation of identity today .
His translation of the Bible into the vernacular ( instead of Latin ) made it more accessible , which had a tremendous impact on the church and German culture . It fostered the development of a standard version of the German language , added several principles to the art of translation , and influenced the writing of an English translation , the Tyndale Bible . His hymns influenced the development of singing in churches . His marriage to Katharina von Bora set a model for the practice of clerical marriage , allowing Protestant clergy to marry .
The definition makes no declaration about the Church 's belief that the Blessed Virgin was sinless in the sense of freedom from actual or personal sin . However , the Church holds that Mary was also sinless personally , " free from all sin , original or personal " . The Council of Trent decreed : " If anyone shall say that a man once justified can sin no more , nor lose grace , and that therefore he who falls and sins was never truly justified ; or , on the contrary , that throughout his whole life he can avoid all sins even venial sins , except by a special privilege of God , as the Church holds in regard to the Blessed Virgin : let him be anathema . "
Cardinals elevated to the diaconal order are mainly officials of the Roman Curia holding various posts in the church administration . Their number and influence has varied through the years . While historically predominantly Italian the group has become much more internationally diverse in later years . While in 1939 about half were Italian by 1994 the number was reduced to one third . Their influence in the election of the Pope has been considered important , they are better informed and connected than the dislocated cardinals but their level of unity has been varied . Under the 1587 decree of Pope Sixtus V , which fixed the maximum size of the College of Cardinals , there were 14 cardinal deacons . Later the number increased . As late as 1939 almost half of the cardinals were members of the curia . Pius XII reduced this percentage to 24 percent . John XXIII brought it back up to 37 percent but Paul VI brought it down to 27 percent where John Paul II has maintained this ratio .

Like any plucked instrument , mandolin notes decay to silence rather than sound out continuously as with a bowed note on a violin , and mandolin notes decay faster than larger stringed instruments like the guitar . This encourages the use of tremolo ( rapid picking of one or more pairs of strings ) to create sustained notes or chords . The mandolin 's paired strings facilitate this technique : the plectrum ( pick ) strikes each of a pair of strings alternately , providing a more full and continuous sound than a single string would .
After a punt from both teams , Carolina got on track with a 9-play , 73-yard scoring drive . Newton completed 4 of 4 passes for 51 yards and rushed twice for 25 yards , while Jonathan Stewart finished the drive with a 1-yard touchdown run , cutting the score to 10–7 with 11:28 left in the second quarter . Later on , Broncos receiver Jordan Norwood received Brad Nortman 's short 28-yard punt surrounded by Panthers players , but none of them attempted to make a tackle , apparently thinking Norwood had called a fair catch . Norwood had not done so , and with no resistance around him , he took off for a Super Bowl record 61-yard return before Mario Addison dragged him down on the Panthers 14-yard line . Despite Denver 's excellent field position , they could not get the ball into the end zone , so McManus kicked a 33-yard field goal that increased their lead to 13–7 .
The second half of the 20th century to the present has seen a gradual shift towards improved human rights for Aboriginal people . In a 1967 referendum over 90 % of the Australian population voted to end constitutional discrimination and to include Aborigines in the national census . During this period many Aboriginal activists began to embrace the term " black " and use their ancestry as a source of pride . Activist Bob Maza said :
Westwood One will carry the game throughout North America , with Kevin Harlan as play-by-play announcer , Boomer Esiason and Dan Fouts as color analysts , and James Lofton and Mark Malone as sideline reporters . Jim Gray will anchor the pre-game and halftime coverage .
The biographical tradition asserts that Virgil began the hexameter Eclogues ( or Bucolics ) in 42 BC and it is thought that the collection was published around 39–38 BC , although this is controversial . The Eclogues ( from the Greek for " selections " ) are a group of ten poems roughly modeled on the bucolic hexameter poetry ( " pastoral poetry " ) of the Hellenistic poet Theocritus . After his victory in the Battle of Philippi in 42 BC , fought against the army led by the assassins of Julius Caesar , Octavian tried to pay off his veterans with land expropriated from towns in northern Italy , supposedly including , according to the tradition , an estate near Mantua belonging to Virgil . The loss of his family farm and the attempt through poetic petitions to regain his property have traditionally been seen as Virgil 's motives in the composition of the Eclogues . This is now thought to be an unsupported inference from interpretations of the Eclogues . In Eclogues 1 and 9 , Virgil indeed dramatizes the contrasting feelings caused by the brutality of the land expropriations through pastoral idiom , but offers no indisputable evidence of the supposed biographic incident . While some readers have identified the poet himself with various characters and their vicissitudes , whether gratitude by an old rustic to a new god ( Ecl . 1 ) , frustrated love by a rustic singer for a distant boy ( his master 's pet , Ecl . 2 ) , or a master singer 's claim to have composed several eclogues ( Ecl . 5 ) , modern scholars largely reject such efforts to garner biographical details from works of fiction , preferring to interpret an author 's characters and themes as illustrations of contemporary life and thought . The ten Eclogues present traditional pastoral themes with a fresh perspective . Eclogues 1 and 9 address the land confiscations and their effects on the Italian countryside . 2 and 3 are pastoral and erotic , discussing both homosexual love ( Ecl . 2 ) and attraction toward people of any gender ( Ecl . 3 ) . Eclogue 4 , addressed to Asinius Pollio , the so-called " Messianic Eclogue " uses the imagery of the golden age in connection with the birth of a child ( who the child was meant to be has been subject to debate ) . 5 and 8 describe the myth of Daphnis in a song contest , 6 , the cosmic and mythological song of Silenus ; 7 , a heated poetic contest , and 10 the sufferings of the contemporary elegiac poet Cornelius Gallus . Virgil is credited [ by whom ? ] in the Eclogues with establishing Arcadia as a poetic ideal that still resonates in Western literature and visual arts and setting the stage for the development of Latin pastoral by Calpurnius Siculus , Nemesianus , and later writers .
The implications are multiple as various research traditions are now [ when ? ] heavily utilizing the lens of identity to examine phenomena . [ citation needed ] One implication of identity and of identity construction can be seen in occupational settings . This becomes increasing challenging in stigmatized jobs or " dirty work " ( Hughes , 1951 ) . Tracy and Trethewey ( 2005 ) state that " individuals gravitate toward and turn away from particular jobs depending in part , on the extent to which they validate a " preferred organizational self " ( Tracy & Tretheway 2005 , p. 169 ) . Some jobs carry different stigmas or acclaims . In her analysis Tracy uses the example of correctional officers trying to shake the stigma of " glorified maids " ( Tracy & Tretheway 2005 ) . " The process by which people arrive at justifications of and values for various occupational choices . " Among these are workplace satisfaction and overall quality of life ( Tracy & Scott 2006 , p. 33 ) . People in these types of jobs are forced to find ways in order to create an identity they can live with . " Crafting a positive sense of self at work is more challenging when one 's work is considered " dirty " by societal standards " ( Tracy & Scott 2006 , p. 7 ) . " In other words , doing taint management is not just about allowing the employee to feel good in that job . " If employees must navigate discourses that question the viability of their work , and/ or experience obstacles in managing taint through transforming dirty work into a badge of honor , it is likely they will find blaming the client to be an efficacious route in affirming their identity " ( Tracy & Scott 2006 , p. 33 ) .
As of 2008 [ update ] , the population was 47.5 % male and 52.5 % female . The population was made up of 44,032 Swiss men ( 35.4 % of the population ) and 15,092 ( 12.1 % ) non-Swiss men . There were 51,531 Swiss women ( 41.4 % ) and 13,726 ( 11.0 % ) non-Swiss women . Of the population in the municipality , 39,008 or about 30.3 % were born in Bern and lived there in 2000 . There were 27,573 or 21.4 % who were born in the same canton , while 25,818 or 20.1 % were born somewhere else in Switzerland , and 27,812 or 21.6 % were born outside of Switzerland .
With the rise of disco in the US and punk rock in the UK , hard rock 's mainstream dominance was rivalled toward the later part of the decade . Disco appealed to a more diverse group of people and punk seemed to take over the rebellious role that hard rock once held . Early punk bands like The Ramones explicitly rebelled against the drum solos and extended guitar solos that characterised stadium rock , with almost all of their songs clocking in around two minutes with no guitar solos . However , new rock acts continued to emerge and record sales remained high into the 1980s . 1977 saw the début and rise to stardom of Foreigner , who went on to release several platinum albums through to the mid-1980s . Midwestern groups like Kansas , REO Speedwagon and Styx helped further cement heavy rock in the Midwest as a form of stadium rock . In 1978 , Van Halen emerged from the Los Angeles music scene with a sound based around the skills of lead guitarist Eddie Van Halen . He popularised a guitar-playing technique of two-handed hammer-ons and pull-offs called tapping , showcased on the song " Eruption " from the album Van Halen , which was highly influential in re-establishing hard rock as a popular genre after the punk and disco explosion , while also redefining and elevating the role of electric guitar .
UNFPA began operations in 1969 as the United Nations Fund for Population Activities ( the name was changed in 1987 ) under the administration of the United Nations Development Fund . In 1971 it was placed under the authority of the United Nations General Assembly .
As of 2000 [ update ] , children and teenagers ( 0–19 years old ) make up 15.1 % of the population , while adults ( 20–64 years old ) make up 65 % and seniors ( over 64 years old ) make up 19.9 % .
A piece of paper was later found on which Luther had written his last statement . The statement was in Latin , apart from " We are beggars , " which was in German .
Additionally , there are around 60,000 non-Jewish African immigrants in Israel , some of whom have sought asylum . Most of the migrants are from communities in Sudan and Eritrea , particularly the Niger-Congo-speaking Nuba groups of the southern Nuba Mountains ; some are illegal immigrants .
This was the first Super Bowl to feature a quarterback on both teams who was the # 1 pick in their draft classes . Manning was the # 1 selection of the 1998 NFL draft , while Newton was picked first in 2011 . The matchup also pits the top two picks of the 2011 draft against each other : Newton for Carolina and Von Miller for Denver . Manning and Newton also set the record for the largest age difference between opposing Super Bowl quarterbacks at 13 years and 48 days ( Manning was 39 , Newton was 26 ) .
While the number of cardinals was small from the times of the Roman Empire to the Renaissance , and frequently smaller than the number of recognized churches entitled to a cardinal priest , in the 16th century the College expanded markedly . In 1587 , Pope Sixtus V sought to arrest this growth by fixing the maximum size of the College at 70 , including 50 cardinal priests , about twice the historical number . This limit was respected until 1958 , and the list of titular churches modified only on rare occasions , generally when a building fell into disrepair . When Pope John XXIII abolished the limit , he began to add new churches to the list , which Popes Paul VI and John Paul II continued to do . Today there are close to 150 titular churches , out of over 300 churches in Rome .
In America , nonprofit organizations like Friends of UNFPA ( formerly Americans for UNFPA ) worked to compensate for the loss of United States federal funding by raising private donations .
In his theses and disputations against the antinomians , Luther reviews and reaffirms , on the one hand , what has been called the " second use of the law , " that is , the law as the Holy Spirit 's tool to work sorrow over sin in man 's heart , thus preparing him for Christ 's fulfillment of the law offered in the gospel . Luther states that everything that is used to work sorrow over sin is called the law , even if it is Christ 's life , Christ 's death for sin , or God 's goodness experienced in creation . Simply refusing to preach the Ten Commandments among Christians – thereby , as it were , removing the three letters l-a-w from the church – does not eliminate the accusing law . Claiming that the law – in any form – should not be preached to Christians anymore would be tantamount to asserting that Christians are no longer sinners in themselves and that the church consists only of essentially holy people .
Anthropologists have contributed to the debate by shifting the focus of research : One of the first challenges for the researcher wishing to carry out empirical research in this area is to identify an appropriate analytical tool . The concept of boundaries is useful here for demonstrating how identity works . In the same way as Barth , in his approach to ethnicity , advocated the critical focus for investigation as being " the ethnic boundary that defines the group rather than the cultural stuff that it encloses " ( 1969:15 ) , social anthropologists such as Cohen and Bray have shifted the focus of analytical study from identity to the boundaries that are used for purposes of identification . If identity is a kind of virtual site in which the dynamic processes and markers used for identification are made apparent , boundaries provide the framework on which this virtual site is built . They concentrated on how the idea of community belonging is differently constructed by individual members and how individuals within the group conceive ethnic boundaries .
QuickBooks sponsored a " Small Business Big Game " contest , in which Death Wish Coffee had a 30-second commercial aired free of charge courtesy of QuickBooks . Death Wish Coffee beat out nine other contenders from across the United States for the free advertisement .
Beginning with the Paris Exposition of 1878 , the instrument 's popularity rebounded . The Exposition was one of many stops for a popular new performing group the Estudiantes Españoles ( Spanish Students ) . They danced and played guitars , violins and the bandurria , which became confused with the mandolin . Along with the energy and awareness created by the day 's hit sensation , a wave of Italian mandolinists travelled Europe in the 1880s and 1890s and in the United States by the mid-1880s , playing and teaching their instrument . The instrument 's popularity continued to increase during the 1890s and mandolin popularity was at its height in " early years of the 20th century . " Thousands were taking up the instrument as a pastime , and it became an instrument of society , taken up by young men and women . Mandolin orchestras were formed worldwide , incorporating not only the mandolin family of instruments , but also guitars , double basses and zithers .
Communism remained an important focus especially during the 1950s and 1960s . Colonialism and racism were important issues that arose . In general , there was a marked trend towards a pragmatic approach to political issues , rather than a philosophical one . Much academic debate regarded one or both of two pragmatic topics : how ( or whether ) to apply utilitarianism to problems of political policy , or how ( or whether ) to apply economic models ( such as rational choice theory ) to political issues . The rise of feminism , LGBT social movements and the end of colonial rule and of the political exclusion of such minorities as African Americans and sexual minorities in the developed world has led to feminist , postcolonial , and multicultural thought becoming significant . This led to a challenge to the social contract by philosophers Charles W. Mills in his book The Racial Contract and Carole Patemen in her book The Sexual Contract that the social contract excluded persons of colour and women respectively .
Following their loss in the divisional round of the previous season 's playoffs , the Denver Broncos underwent numerous coaching changes , including a mutual parting with head coach John Fox ( who had won four divisional championships in his four years as Broncos head coach ) , and the hiring of Gary Kubiak as the new head coach . Under Kubiak , the Broncos planned to install a run-oriented offense with zone blocking to blend in with quarterback Peyton Manning 's shotgun passing skills , but struggled with numerous changes and injuries to the offensive line , as well as Manning having his worst statistical season since his rookie year with the Indianapolis Colts in 1998 , due to a plantar fasciitis injury in his heel that he had suffered since the summer , and the simple fact that Manning was getting old , as he turned 39 in the 2015 off-season . Although the team had a 7–0 start , Manning led the NFL in interceptions . In week 10 , Manning suffered a partial tear of the plantar fasciitis in his left foot . He set the NFL 's all-time record for career passing yards in this game , but was benched after throwing four interceptions in favor of backup quarterback Brock Osweiler , who took over as the starter for most of the remainder of the regular season . Osweiler was injured , however , leading to Manning 's return during the Week 17 regular season finale , where the Broncos were losing 13–7 against the 4–11 San Diego Chargers , resulting in Manning re-claiming the starting quarterback position for the playoffs by leading the team to a key 27–20 win that enabled the team to clinch the number one overall AFC seed . Under defensive coordinator Wade Phillips , the Broncos ' defense ranked number one in total yards allowed , passing yards allowed and sacks , and like the previous three seasons , the team has continued to set numerous individual , league and franchise records . With the defense carrying the team despite the issues with the offense , the Broncos finished the regular season with a 12–4 record and earned home-field advantage throughout the AFC playoffs .
However , this oft-quoted saying of Tetzel was by no means representative of contemporary Catholic teaching on indulgences , but rather a reflection of his capacity to exaggerate . Yet if Tetzel overstated the matter in regard to indulgences for the dead , his teaching on indulgences for the living was in line with Catholic dogma of the time .
The Panthers defense gave up just 308 points , ranking sixth in the league , while also leading the NFL in interceptions with 24 and boasting four Pro Bowl selections . Pro Bowl defensive tackle Kawann Short led the team in sacks with 11 , while also forcing three fumbles and recovering two . Fellow lineman Mario Addison added 6½ sacks . The Panthers line also featured veteran defensive end Jared Allen , a 5-time pro bowler who was the NFL 's active career sack leader with 136 , along with defensive end Kony Ealy , who had 5 sacks in just 9 starts . Behind them , two of the Panthers three starting linebackers were also selected to play in the Pro Bowl : Thomas Davis and Luke Kuechly . Davis compiled 5½ sacks , four forced fumbles , and four interceptions , while Kuechly led the team in tackles ( 118 ) forced two fumbles , and intercepted four passes of his own . Carolina 's secondary featured Pro Bowl safety Kurt Coleman , who led the team with a career high seven interceptions , while also racking up 88 tackles and Pro Bowl cornerback Josh Norman , who developed into a shutdown corner during the season and had four interceptions , two of which were returned for touchdowns .
The United Nations Population Fund ( UNFPA ) , formerly the United Nations Fund for Population Activities , is a UN organization . The UNFPA says it " is the lead UN agency for delivering a world where every pregnancy is wanted , every childbirth is safe and every young person 's potential is fulfilled . " Their work involves the improvement of reproductive health ; including creation of national strategies and protocols , and providing supplies and services . The organization has recently been known for its worldwide campaign against obstetric fistula and female genital mutilation .
The Siddi are an ethnic group inhabiting India and Pakistan whose members are descended from Bantu peoples from Southeast Africa that were brought to the Indian subcontinent as slaves by Arab and Portuguese merchants . Although it is commonly believed locally that " Siddi " derives from a word meaning " black " , the term is actually derived from " Sayyid " , the title borne by the captains of the Arab vessels that first brought Siddi settlers to the area . In the Makran strip of the Sindh and Balochistan provinces in southwestern Pakistan , these Bantu descendants are known as the Makrani . There was a brief " Black Power " movement in Sindh in the 1960s and many Siddi are proud of and celebrate their African ancestry .
The mandolin has been used occasionally in rock music , first appearing in the psychedelic era of the late 1960s . Levon Helm of The Band occasionally moved from his drum kit to play mandolin , most notably on Rag Mama Rag , Rockin ' Chair , and Evangeline . Ian Anderson of Jethro Tull played mandolin on Fat Man , from their second album , Stand Up , and also occasionally on later releases . Rod Stewart 's 1971 No . 1 hit Maggie May features a significant mandolin riff . David Grisman played mandolin on two Grateful Dead songs on the American Beauty album , Friend of the Devil and Ripple , which became instant favorites among amateur pickers at jam sessions and campground gatherings . John Paul Jones and Jimmy Page both played mandolin on Led Zeppelin songs . The popular alt rock group Imagine Dragons feature the mandolin on a few of their songs , most prominently being It 's Time . Dash Crofts of the soft rock duo Seals and Crofts extensively used mandolin in their repertoire during the 1970s . Styx released the song Boat on the River in 1980 , which featured Tommy Shaw on vocals and mandolin . The song did n't chart in the United States but was popular in much of Europe and the Philippines .
The Ptolemaic Kingdom was a powerful Hellenistic state , extending from southern Syria in the east , to Cyrene to the west , and south to the frontier with Nubia . Alexandria became the capital city and a centre of Greek culture and trade . To gain recognition by the native Egyptian populace , they named themselves as the successors to the Pharaohs . The later Ptolemies took on Egyptian traditions , had themselves portrayed on public monuments in Egyptian style and dress , and participated in Egyptian religious life .
As the designated home team in the annual rotation between AFC and NFC teams , the Broncos elected to wear their road white jerseys with matching white pants . Elway stated , " We 've had Super Bowl success in our white uniforms . " The Broncos last wore matching white jerseys and pants in the Super Bowl in Super Bowl XXXIII , Elway 's last game as Denver QB , when they defeated the Atlanta Falcons 34–19 . In their only other Super Bowl win in Super Bowl XXXII , Denver wore blue jerseys , which was their primary color at the time . They also lost Super Bowl XXI when they wore white jerseys , but they are 0-4 in Super Bowls when wearing orange jerseys , losing in Super Bowl XII , XXII , XXIV , and XLVIII . The only other AFC champion team to have worn white as the designated home team in the Super Bowl was the Pittsburgh Steelers ; they defeated the Seattle Seahawks 21–10 in Super Bowl XL 10 seasons prior . The Broncos ' decision to wear white meant the Panthers would wear their standard home uniform : black jerseys with silver pants .
In the Late Empire and Middle Ages Vergilius was spelled Virgilius . Two explanations are commonly given for this alteration . One deduces a false etymology associated with the word virgo ( " maiden " in Latin ) due to Virgil 's excessive , " maiden " -like modesty . Alternatively , some argue that Vergilius was altered to Virgilius by analogy with the Latin virga ( " wand " ) due to the magical or prophetic powers attributed to Virgil in the Middle Ages ( this explanation is found in only a handful of manuscripts , however , and was probably not widespread ) . In Norman schools ( following the French practice ) , the habit was to anglicize Latin names by dropping their Latin endings , hence Virgil . In the 19th century , some German-trained classicists in the United States suggested modification to Vergil , as it is closer to his original name , and is also the traditional German spelling . [ citation needed ] Modern usage permits both , though the Oxford guide to style recommends Vergilius to avoid confusion with the 8th-century grammarian Virgilius Maro Grammaticus . Some post-Renaissance writers liked to affect the sobriquet " The Swan of Mantua " . [ citation needed ]
The Panthers used the San Jose State practice facility and stayed at the San Jose Marriott . The Broncos practiced at Stanford University and stayed at the Santa Clara Marriott .
In honor of the 50th Super Bowl , the pregame ceremony featured the on-field introduction of 39 of the 43 previous Super Bowl Most Valuable Players . Bart Starr ( MVP of Super Bowls I and II ) and Chuck Howley ( MVP of Super Bowl V ) appeared via video , while Peyton Manning ( MVP of Super Bowl XLI and current Broncos quarterback ) was shown in the locker room preparing for the game . No plans were announced regarding the recognition of Harvey Martin , co-MVP of Super Bowl XII , who died in 2001 .
Concerns were raised over whether Levi 's Stadium 's field was of a high enough quality to host a Super Bowl ; during the inaugural season , the field had to be re-sodded multiple times due to various issues , and during a week 6 game earlier in the 2015 season , a portion of the turf collapsed under Baltimore Ravens kicker Justin Tucker , causing him to slip and miss a field goal , although the field has not had any major issues since . As is customary for Super Bowl games played at natural grass stadiums , the NFL re-sodded the field with a new playing surface ; a hybrid Bermuda 419 turf . NFL and Atlanta Braves field director Ed Mangan stated that the field was in " great shape " for gameday . However , the turf showed problem throughout the game , with a number of players needing to change their cleats during the game and player slipping during plays all throughout the game .
The last ruler from the Ptolemaic line was Cleopatra VII , who committed suicide following the burial of her lover Mark Antony who had died in her arms ( from a self-inflicted stab wound ) , after Octavian had captured Alexandria and her mercenary forces had fled . The Ptolemies faced rebellions of native Egyptians often caused by an unwanted regime and were involved in foreign and civil wars that led to the decline of the kingdom and its annexation by Rome . Nevertheless , Hellenistic culture continued to thrive in Egypt well after the Muslim conquest .
Denver took the opening kickoff and started out strong with Peyton Manning completing an 18-yard pass to tight end Owen Daniels and a 22-yard throw to receiver Andre Caldwell . A pair of carries by C. J. Anderson moved the ball up 20 yards to the Panthers 14-yard line , but Carolina 's defense dug in over the next three plays . First , linebacker Shaq Thompson tackled Ronnie Hillman for a 3-yard loss . Then after an incompletion , Thomas Davis tackled Anderson for a 1-yard gain on third down , forcing Denver to settle for a 3–0 lead on a Brandon McManus 34-yard field goal . The score marked the first time in the entire postseason that Carolina was facing a deficit .

The Panthers beat the Seattle Seahawks in the divisional round , running up a 31–0 halftime lead and then holding off a furious second half comeback attempt to win 31–24 , avenging their elimination from a year earlier . The Panthers then blew out the Arizona Cardinals in the NFC Championship Game , 49–15 , racking up 487 yards and forcing seven turnovers .
Virgil is traditionally ranked as one of Rome 's greatest poets . His Aeneid has been considered the national epic of ancient Rome from the time of its composition to the present day . Modeled after Homer 's Iliad and Odyssey , the Aeneid follows the Trojan refugee Aeneas as he struggles to fulfill his destiny and arrive on the shores of Italy—in Roman mythology the founding act of Rome . Virgil 's work has had wide and deep influence on Western literature , most notably Dante 's Divine Comedy , in which Virgil appears as Dante 's guide through hell and purgatory .
A person may display either relative weakness or relative strength in terms of both exploration and commitments . When assigned categories , four possible permutations result : identity diffusion , identity foreclosure , identity moratorium , and identity achievement . Diffusion is when a person lacks both exploration in life and interest in committing even to those unchosen roles that he or she occupies . Foreclosure is when a person has not chosen extensively in the past , but seems willing to commit to some relevant values , goals , or roles in the future . Moratorium is when a person displays a kind of flightiness , ready to make choices but unable to commit to them . Finally , achievement is when a person makes identity choices and commits to them .
Luther dedicated himself to the Augustinian order , devoting himself to fasting , long hours in prayer , pilgrimage , and frequent confession . Luther described this period of his life as one of deep spiritual despair . He said , " I lost touch with Christ the Savior and Comforter , and made of him the jailer and hangman of my poor soul . " Johann von Staupitz , his superior , pointed Luther 's mind away from continual reflection upon his sins toward the merits of Christ . He taught that true repentance does not involve self-inflicted penances and punishments but rather a change of heart .
Modern Egypt is considered to be a regional and middle power , with significant cultural , political , and military influence in North Africa , the Middle East and the Muslim world . Its economy is one of the largest and most diversified in the Middle East , with sectors such as tourism , agriculture , industry and services at almost equal production levels . In 2011 , longtime President Hosni Mubarak stepped down amid mass protests . Later elections saw the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood , which was ousted by the army a year later amid mass protests .
For the first time , the Super Bowl 50 Host Committee and the NFL have openly sought disabled veteran and lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender-owned businesses in Business Connect , the Super Bowl program that provides local companies with contracting opportunities in and around the Super Bowl . The host committee has already raised over $ 40 million through sponsors including Apple , Google , Yahoo ! , Intel , Gap , Chevron , and Dignity Health .

Martin Luther married Katharina von Bora , one of 12 nuns he had helped escape from the Nimbschen Cistercian convent in April 1523 , when he arranged for them to be smuggled out in herring barrels . " Suddenly , and while I was occupied with far different thoughts , " he wrote to Wenceslaus Link , " the Lord has plunged me into marriage . " At the time of their marriage , Katharina was 26 years old and Luther was 41 years old .
According to scholars Walter Krämer , Götz Trenkler , Gerhard Ritter , and Gerhard Prause , the story of the posting on the door , even though it has settled as one of the pillars of history , has little foundation in truth . The story is based on comments made by Philipp Melanchthon , though it is thought that he was not in Wittenberg at the time .
Luther 's 1538 hymnic version of the Lord 's Prayer , " Vater unser im Himmelreich " , corresponds exactly to Luther 's explanation of the prayer in the Small Catechism , with one stanza for each of the seven prayer petitions , plus opening and closing stanzas . The hymn functioned both as a liturgical setting of the Lord 's Prayer and as a means of examining candidates on specific catechism questions . The extant manuscript shows multiple revisions , demonstrating Luther 's concern to clarify and strengthen the text and to provide an appropriately prayerful tune . Other 16th- and 20th-century versifications of the Lord 's Prayer have adopted Luther 's tune , although modern texts are considerably shorter .
The game 's media day , which was typically held on the Tuesday afternoon prior to the game , was moved to the Monday evening and re-branded as Super Bowl Opening Night . The event was held on February 1 , 2016 at SAP Center in San Jose . Alongside the traditional media availabilities , the event featured an opening ceremony with player introductions on a replica of the Golden Gate Bridge .
The transition from the mandolino to the mandolin began around 1744 with the designing of the metal-string mandolin by the Vinaccia family , 3 brass strings and one of gut , using friction tuning pegs on a fingerboard that sat " flush " with the sound table . The mandolin grew in popularity over the next 60 years , in the streets where it was used by young men courting and by street musicians , and in the concert hall . After the Napoleonic Wars of 1815 , however , its popularity began to fall . The 19th century produced some prominent players , including Bartolomeo Bortolazzi of Venice and Pietro Vimercati . However , professional virtuosity was in decline , and the mandolin music changed as the mandolin became a folk instrument ; " the large repertoire of notated instrumental music for the mandolino and the mandoline was completely forgotten " . The export market for mandolins from Italy dried up around 1815 , and when Carmine de Laurentiis wrote a mandolin method in 1874 , the Music World magazine wrote that the mandolin was " out of date . " Salvador Léonardi mentioned this decline in his 1921 book , Méthode pour Banjoline ou Mandoline-Banjo , saying that the mandolin had been declining in popularity from previous times .
In 1521 Luther dealt largely with prophecy , in which he broadened the foundations of the Reformation placing them on prophetic faith . His main interest was centered on the prophecy of the Little Horn in Daniel 8:9–12 , 23–25 . The antichrist of 2 Thessalonians 2 was identified as the power of the Papacy . So too was the Little Horn of Daniel 7 , coming up among the divisions of Rome , explicitly applied .
The expansion of mandolin use continued after World War II through the late 1960s , and Japan still maintains a strong classical music tradition using mandolins , with active orchestras and university music programs . New orchestras were founded and new orchestral compositions composed . Japanese mandolin orchestras today may consist of up to 40 or 50 members , and can include woodwind , percussion , and brass sections . Japan also maintains an extensive collection of 20th Century mandolin music from Europe and one of the most complete collections of mandolin magazines from mandolin 's golden age , purchased by Morishige Takei .
Some scholars , such as Mark U. Edwards in his book Luther 's Last Battles : Politics and Polemics 1531–46 ( 1983 ) , suggest that since Luther 's increasingly antisemitic views developed during the years his health deteriorated , it is possible they were at least partly the product of a declining state of mind . Edwards also comments that Luther often deliberately used " vulgarity and violence " for effect , both in his writings condemning the Jews and in diatribes against " Turks " ( Muslims ) and Catholics .
Some succeeded their fathers as rulers , such as Sultan Ahmad al-Mansur , who ruled Morocco from 1578 to 1608 . He was not technically considered as a mixed-race child of a slave ; his mother was Fulani and a concubine of his father . Such tolerance for black persons , even when technically " free " , was not so common in Morocco . The long association of sub-Saharan peoples as slaves is shown in the term abd ( Arabic : عبد‎ , ) ( meaning " slave " ) ; it is still frequently used in the Arabic-speaking world as a term for black people .
Other widely used alloys that contain zinc include nickel silver , typewriter metal , soft and aluminium solder , and commercial bronze . Zinc is also used in contemporary pipe organs as a substitute for the traditional lead/tin alloy in pipes . Alloys of 85–88 % zinc , 4–10 % copper , and 2–8 % aluminium find limited use in certain types of machine bearings . Zinc is the primary metal used in making American one cent coins since 1982 . The zinc core is coated with a thin layer of copper to give the impression of a copper coin . In 1994 , 33,200 tonnes ( 36,600 short tons ) of zinc were used to produce 13.6 billion pennies in the United States .
Without Luther 's backing for the uprising , many rebels laid down their weapons ; others felt betrayed . Their defeat by the Swabian League at the Battle of Frankenhausen on 15 May 1525 , followed by Müntzer 's execution , brought the revolutionary stage of the Reformation to a close . Thereafter , radicalism found a refuge in the anabaptist movement and other religious movements , while Luther 's Reformation flourished under the wing of the secular powers .
This was the first Super Bowl to feature a quarterback on both teams who was the # 1 pick in their draft classes . Manning was the # 1 selection of the 1998 NFL draft , while Newton was picked first in 2011 . The matchup also pits the top two picks of the 2011 draft against each other : Newton for Carolina and Von Miller for Denver . Manning and Newton also set the record for the largest age difference between opposing Super Bowl quarterbacks at 13 years and 48 days ( Manning was 39 , Newton was 26 ) .
Another debate developed around the ( distinct ) criticisms of liberal political theory made by Michael Walzer , Michael Sandel and Charles Taylor . The liberal-communitarian debate is often considered valuable for generating a new set of philosophical problems , rather than a profound and illuminating clash of perspective.These and other communitarians ( such as Alasdair MacIntyre and Daniel A . Bell ) argue that , contra liberalism , communities are prior to individuals and therefore should be the center of political focus . Communitarians tend to support greater local control as well as economic and social policies which encourage the growth of social capital .
Although the doctrine of Mary 's Immaculate Conception appears only later among Latin ( and particularly Frankish ) theologians , it became ever more manifest among Byzantine theologians reliant on Gregory Nazianzen 's Mariology in the Medieval or Byzantine East . Although hymnographers and scholars , like the Emperor Justinian I , were accustomed to call Mary " prepurified " in their poetic and credal statements , the first point of departure for more fully commenting on Nazianzen 's meaning occurs in Sophronius of Jerusalem . In other places Sophronius explains that the Theotokos was already immaculate , when she was " purified " at the Annunciation and goes so far as to note that John the Baptist is literally " holier than all 'Men ' born of woman " since Mary 's surpassing holiness signifies that she was holier than even John after his sanctification in utero . Sophronius ' teaching is augmented and incorporated by St. John Damascene ( d. 749/750 ) . John , besides many passages wherein he extolls the Theotokos for her purification at the Annunciation , grants her the unique honor of " purifying the waters of baptism by touching them . " This honor was most famously and firstly attributed to Christ , especially in the legacy of Nazianzen . As such , Nazianzen 's assertion of parallel holiness between the prepurified Mary and purified Jesus of the New Testament is made even more explicit in Damascene in his discourse on Mary 's holiness to also imitate Christ 's baptism at the Jordan . The Damascene 's hymnongraphy and De fide Orthodoxa explicitly use Mary 's " pre purification " as a key to understanding her absolute holiness and unsullied human nature . In fact , Damascene ( along with Nazianzen ) serves as the source for nearly all subsequent promotion of Mary 's complete holiness from her Conception by the " all pure seed " of Joachim and the womb " wider than heaven " of St. Ann .
The papal bull defining the dogma , Ineffabilis Deus , mentioned in particular the patrististic interpretation of Genesis 3:15 as referring to a woman , Mary , who would be eternally at enmity with the evil serpent and completely triumphing over him . It said the Fathers saw foreshadowings of Mary 's " wondrous abundance of divine gifts and original innocence " " in that ark of Noah , which was built by divine command and escaped entirely safe and sound from the common shipwreck of the whole world ; in the ladder which Jacob saw reaching from the earth to heaven , by whose rungs the angels of God ascended and descended , and on whose top the Lord himself leaned ; in that bush which Moses saw in the holy place burning on all sides , which was not consumed or injured in any way but grew green and blossomed beautifully ; in that impregnable tower before the enemy , from which hung a thousand bucklers and all the armor of the strong ; in that garden enclosed on all sides , which can not be violated or corrupted by any deceitful plots ; in that resplendent city of God , which has its foundations on the holy mountains ; in that most august temple of God , which , radiant with divine splendours , is full of the glory of God ; and in very many other biblical types of this kind . "
Drinking water supply and sanitation in Egypt is characterised by both achievements and challenges . Among the achievements are an increase of piped water supply between 1990 and 2010 from 89 % to 100 % in urban areas and from 39 % to 93 % in rural areas despite rapid population growth , the elimination of open defecation in rural areas during the same period , and in general a relatively high level of investment in infrastructure . Access to an improved water source in Egypt is now practically universal with a rate of 99 % . About one half of the population is connected to sanitary sewers .
In Anglo-American academic political philosophy , the publication of John Rawls 's A Theory of Justice in 1971 is considered a milestone . Rawls used a thought experiment , the original position , in which representative parties choose principles of justice for the basic structure of society from behind a veil of ignorance . Rawls also offered a criticism of utilitarian approaches to questions of political justice . Robert Nozick 's 1974 book Anarchy , State , and Utopia , which won a National Book Award , responded to Rawls from a libertarian perspective and gained academic respectability for libertarian viewpoints .
The international repertoire of music for mandolin is almost unlimited , and musicians use it to play various types of music . This is especially true of violin music , since the mandolin has the same tuning of the violin . Following its invention and early development in Italy the mandolin spread throughout the European continent . The instrument was primarily used in a classical tradition with Mandolin orchestras , so called Estudiantinas or in Germany Zupforchestern appearing in many cities . Following this continental popularity of the mandolin family local traditions appeared outside of Europe in the Americas and in Japan . Travelling mandolin virtuosi like Giuseppe Pettine , Raffaele Calace and Silvio Ranieri contributed to the mandolin becoming a " fad " instrument in the early 20th century . This " mandolin craze " was fading by the 1930s , but just as this practice was falling into disuse , the mandolin found a new niche in American country , old-time music , bluegrass and folk music . More recently , the Baroque and Classical mandolin repertory and styles have benefited from the raised awareness of and interest in Early music , with media attention to classical players such as Israeli Avi Avital , Italian Carlo Aonzo and American Joseph Brent .
Peyton Manning became the first quarterback ever to lead two different teams to multiple Super Bowls . He is also the oldest quarterback ever to play in a Super Bowl at age 39 . The past record was held by John Elway , who led the Broncos to victory in Super Bowl XXXIII at age 38 and is currently Denver 's Executive Vice President of Football Operations and General Manager .
These theorists were driven by two basic questions : one , by what right or need do people form states ; and two , what the best form for a state could be . These fundamental questions involved a conceptual distinction between the concepts of " state " and " government . " It was decided that " state " would refer to a set of enduring institutions through which power would be distributed and its use justified . The term " government " would refer to a specific group of people who occupied the institutions of the state , and create the laws and ordinances by which the people , themselves included , would be bound . This conceptual distinction continues to operate in political science , although some political scientists , philosophers , historians and cultural anthropologists have argued that most political action in any given society occurs outside of its state , and that there are societies that are not organized into states that nevertheless must be considered in political terms . As long as the concept of natural order was not introduced , the social sciences could not evolve independently of theistic thinking . Since the cultural revolution of the 17th century in England , which spread to France and the rest of Europe , society has been considered subject to natural laws akin to the physical world .
Established acts benefited from the new commercial climate , with Whitesnake 's self-titled album ( 1987 ) selling over 17 million copies , outperforming anything in Coverdale 's or Deep Purple 's catalogue before or since . It featured the rock anthem " Here I Go Again '87 " as one of 4 UK top 20 singles . The follow-up Slip of the Tongue ( 1989 ) went platinum , but according to critics Steve Erlwine and Greg Prato , " it was a considerable disappointment after the across-the-board success of Whitesnake " . Aerosmith 's comeback album Permanent Vacation ( 1987 ) would begin a decade long revival of their popularity . Crazy Nights ( 1987 ) by Kiss was the band 's highest charting release in the US since 1979 and the highest of their career in the UK . Mötley Crüe with Girls , Girls , Girls ( 1987 ) continued their commercial success and Def Leppard with Hysteria ( 1987 ) hit their commercial peak , the latter producing seven hit singles ( a record for a hard rock act ) . Guns N ' Roses released the best-selling début of all time , Appetite for Destruction ( 1987 ) . With a " grittier " and " rawer " sound than most glam metal , it produced three top 10 hits , including the number one " Sweet Child O ' Mine " . Some of the glam rock bands that formed in the mid-1980s , such as White Lion and Cinderella experienced their biggest success during this period with their respective albums Pride ( 1987 ) and Long Cold Winter ( 1988 ) both going multi-platinum and launching a series of hit singles . In the last years of the decade , the most notable successes were New Jersey ( 1988 ) by Bon Jovi , OU812 ( 1988 ) by Van Halen , Open Up and Say ... Ahh ! ( 1988 ) by Poison , Pump ( 1989 ) by Aerosmith , and Mötley Crüe 's most commercially successful album Dr. Feelgood ( 1989 ) . New Jersey spawned five Top 10 singles , a record for a hard rock act . In 1988 from 25 June to 5 November , the number one spot on the Billboard 200 album chart was held by a hard rock album for 18 out of 20 consecutive weeks ; the albums were OU812 , Hysteria , Appetite for Destruction , and New Jersey . A final wave of glam rock bands arrived in the late 1980s , and experienced success with multi-platinum albums and hit singles from 1989 until the early 1990s , among them Extreme , Warrant Slaughter and FireHouse . Skid Row also released their eponymous début ( 1989 ) , reaching number six on the Billboard 200 , but they were to be one of the last major bands that emerged in the glam rock era .
At the time of the Marburg Colloquy , Suleiman the Magnificent was besieging Vienna with a vast Ottoman army . Luther had argued against resisting the Turks in his 1518 Explanation of the Ninety-five Theses , provoking accusations of defeatism . He saw the Turks as a scourge sent to punish Christians by God , as agents of the Biblical apocalypse that would destroy the antichrist , whom Luther believed to be the papacy , and the Roman Church . He consistently rejected the idea of a Holy War , " as though our people were an army of Christians against the Turks , who were enemies of Christ . This is absolutely contrary to Christ 's doctrine and name " . On the other hand , in keeping with his doctrine of the two kingdoms , Luther did support non-religious war against the Turks . In 1526 , he argued in Whether Soldiers can be in a State of Grace that national defence is reason for a just war . By 1529 , in On War against the Turk , he was actively urging Emperor Charles V and the German people to fight a secular war against the Turks . He made clear , however , that the spiritual war against an alien faith was separate , to be waged through prayer and repentance . Around the time of the Siege of Vienna , Luther wrote a prayer for national deliverance from the Turks , asking God to " give to our emperor perpetual victory over our enemies " .
Although not yet tested as a therapy in humans , a growing body of evidence indicates that zinc may preferentially kill prostate cancer cells . Because zinc naturally homes to the prostate and because the prostate is accessible with relatively non-invasive procedures , its potential as a chemotherapeutic agent in this type of cancer has shown promise . However , other studies have demonstrated that chronic use of zinc supplements in excess of the recommended dosage may actually increase the chance of developing prostate cancer , also likely due to the natural buildup of this heavy metal in the prostate .
In 2000 [ update ] , there were 94,367 workers who commuted into the municipality and 16,424 workers who commuted away . The municipality is a net importer of workers , with about 5.7 workers entering the municipality for every one leaving . Of the working population , 50.6 % used public transport to get to work , and 20.6 % used a private car .
As a non-directive and flexible analytical tool , the concept of boundaries helps both to map and to define the changeability and mutability that are characteristic of people 's experiences of the self in society . While identity is a volatile , flexible and abstract 'thing ' , its manifestations and the ways in which it is exercised are often open to view . Identity is made evident through the use of markers such as language , dress , behaviour and choice of space , whose effect depends on their recognition by other social beings . Markers help to create the boundaries that define similarities or differences between the marker wearer and the marker perceivers , their effectiveness depends on a shared understanding of their meaning . In a social context , misunderstandings can arise due to a misinterpretation of the significance of specific markers . Equally , an individual can use markers of identity to exert influence on other people without necessarily fulfilling all the criteria that an external observer might typically associate with such an abstract identity .
In 1970 , President Nasser died and was succeeded by Anwar Sadat . Sadat switched Egypt 's Cold War allegiance from the Soviet Union to the United States , expelling Soviet advisors in 1972 . He launched the Infitah economic reform policy , while clamping down on religious and secular opposition . In 1973 , Egypt , along with Syria , launched the October War , a surprise attack to regain part of the Sinai territory Israel had captured 6 years earlier . it presented Sadat with a victory that allowed him to regain the Sinai later in return for peace with Israel .
Columbia founded Epic Records in 1953 . In 1956 , Conkling left Columbia , he would help establish the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences before eventually becoming the first president of the newly launched Warner Bros. Records , and Goddard Lieberson began the first of two stints as head of the record company . In 1958 , Columbia founded another label , Date Records , which initially issued rockabilly music .

Six-time Grammy winner and Academy Award nominee Lady Gaga performed the national anthem , while Academy Award winner Marlee Matlin provided American Sign Language ( ASL ) translation .
Mary 's complete sinlessness and concomitant exemption from any taint from the first moment of her existence was a doctrine familiar to Greek theologians of Byzantium . Beginning with St. Gregory Nazianzen , his explanation of the " purification " of Jesus and Mary at the circumcision ( Luke 2:22 ) prompted him to consider the primary meaning of " purification " in Christology ( and by extension in Mariology ) to refer to a perfectly sinless nature that manifested itself in glory in a moment of grace ( e.g. , Jesus at his Baptism ) . St. Gregory Nazianzen designated Mary as " prokathartheisa ( prepurified ) . " Gregory likely attempted to solve the riddle of the Purification of Jesus and Mary in the Temple through considering the human natures of Jesus and Mary as equally holy and therefore both purified in this manner of grace and glory . Gregory 's doctrines surrounding Mary 's purification were likely related to the burgeoning commemoration of the Mother of God in and around Constantinople very close to the date of Christmas . Nazianzen 's title of Mary at the Annunciation as " prepurified " was subsequently adopted by all theologians interested in his Mariology to justify the Byzantine equivalent of the Immaculate Conception . This is especially apparent in the Fathers St. Sophronios of Jerusalem and St. John Damascene , who will be treated below in this article at the section on Church Fathers . About the time of Damascene , the public celebration of the " Conception of St. Ann [ i.e. , of the Theotokos in her womb ] " was becoming popular . After this period , the " purification " of the perfect natures of Jesus and Mary would not only mean moments of grace and glory at the Incarnation and Baptism and other public Byzantine liturgical feasts , but purification was eventually associated with the feast of Mary 's very conception ( along with her Presentation in the Temple as a toddler ) by Orthodox authors of the 2nd millennium ( e.g. , St. Nicholas Cabasilas and Joseph Bryennius ) .
The First Intermediate Period ushered in a time of political upheaval for about 150 years . Stronger Nile floods and stabilisation of government , however , brought back renewed prosperity for the country in the Middle Kingdom c. 2040 BC , reaching a peak during the reign of Pharaoh Amenemhat III . A second period of disunity heralded the arrival of the first foreign ruling dynasty in Egypt , that of the Semitic Hyksos . The Hyksos invaders took over much of Lower Egypt around 1650 BC and founded a new capital at Avaris . They were driven out by an Upper Egyptian force led by Ahmose I , who founded the Eighteenth Dynasty and relocated the capital from Memphis to Thebes .
From outside the United Kingdom and the United States , the Canadian trio Rush released three distinctively hard rock albums in 1974–75 ( Rush , Fly by Night and Caress of Steel ) before moving toward a more progressive sound with the 1976 album 2112 . The Irish band Thin Lizzy , which had formed in the late 1960s , made their most substantial commercial breakthrough in 1976 with the hard rock album Jailbreak and their worldwide hit " The Boys Are Back in Town " , which reached number 8 in the UK and number 12 in the US . Their style , consisting of two duelling guitarists often playing leads in harmony , proved itself to be a large influence on later bands . They reached their commercial , and arguably their artistic peak with Black Rose : A Rock Legend ( 1979 ) . The arrival of Scorpions from Germany marked the geographical expansion of the subgenre . Australian-formed AC/DC , with a stripped back , riff heavy and abrasive style that also appealed to the punk generation , began to gain international attention from 1976 , culminating in the release of their multi-platinum albums Let There Be Rock ( 1977 ) and Highway to Hell ( 1979 ) . Also influenced by a punk ethos were heavy metal bands like Motörhead , while Judas Priest abandoned the remaining elements of the blues in their music , further differentiating the hard rock and heavy metal styles and helping to create the New Wave of British Heavy Metal which was pursued by bands like Iron Maiden , Saxon and Venom .
UNFPA provided aid to Peru 's reproductive health program in the mid-to-late '90s . When it was discovered a Peruvian program had been engaged in carrying out coercive sterilizations , UNFPA called for reforms and protocols to protect the rights of women seeking assistance . UNFPA was not involved in the scandal , but continued work with the country after the abuses had become public to help end the abuses and reform laws and practices .
With 4:51 left in regulation , Carolina got the ball on their own 24-yard line with a chance to mount a game-winning drive , and soon faced 3rd-and-9 . On the next play , Miller stripped the ball away from Newton , and after several players dove for it , it took a long bounce backwards and was recovered by Ward , who returned it five yards to the Panthers 4-yard line . Although several players dove into the pile to attempt to recover it , Newton did not and his lack of aggression later earned him heavy criticism . Meanwhile , Denver 's offense was kept out of the end zone for three plays , but a holding penalty on cornerback Josh Norman gave the Broncos a new set of downs . Then Anderson scored on a 2-yard touchdown run and Manning completed a pass to Bennie Fowler for a 2-point conversion , giving Denver a 24–10 lead with 3:08 left and essentially putting the game away . Carolina had two more drives , but failed to get a first down on each one .
Various gold-themed promotions and initiatives were held throughout the 2015 NFL season to tie into the " Golden Super Bowl " ; gold-tinted logos were implemented across the NFL 's properties and painted on fields , the numbering of the 50-yard line on fields was colored gold , and beginning on week 7 , all sideline jackets and hats featured gold-trimmed logos . Gold footballs were given to each high school that has had a player or coach appear in the Super Bowl , and " homecoming " events were also held by Super Bowl-winning teams at games .
Ethnic Egyptians are by far the largest ethnic group in the country , constituting 91 % of the total population . Ethnic minorities include the Abazas , Turks , Greeks , Bedouin Arab tribes living in the eastern deserts and the Sinai Peninsula , the Berber-speaking Siwis ( Amazigh ) of the Siwa Oasis , and the Nubian communities clustered along the Nile . There are also tribal Beja communities concentrated in the south-eastern-most corner of the country , and a number of Dom clans mostly in the Nile Delta and Faiyum who are progressively becoming assimilated as urbanisation increases .
Until 1917 , it was possible for someone who was not a priest , but only in minor orders , to become a cardinal ( see " lay cardinals " , below ) , but they were enrolled only in the order of cardinal deacons . For example , in the 16th century , Reginald Pole was a cardinal for 18 years before he was ordained a priest . In 1917 it was established that all cardinals , even cardinal deacons , had to be priests , and , in 1962 , Pope John XXIII set the norm that all cardinals be ordained as bishops , even if they are only priests at the time of appointment . As a consequence of these two changes , canon 351 of the 1983 Code of Canon Law requires that a cardinal be at least in the order of priesthood at his appointment , and that those who are not already bishops must receive episcopal consecration . Several cardinals aged over 80 or close to it when appointed have obtained dispensation from the rule of having to be a bishop . These were all appointed cardinal-deacons , but one of them , Roberto Tucci , lived long enough to exercise the right of option and be promoted to the rank of cardinal-priest .
Super Bowl 50 featured numerous records from individuals and teams . Denver won despite being massively outgained in total yards ( 315 to 194 ) and first downs ( 21 to 11 ) . Their 194 yards and 11 first downs were both the lowest totals ever by a Super Bowl winning team . The previous record was 244 yards by the Baltimore Ravens in Super Bowl XXXV . Only seven other teams had ever gained less than 200 yards in a Super Bowl , and all of them had lost . The Broncos ' seven sacks tied a Super Bowl record set by the Chicago Bears in Super Bowl XX . Kony Ealy tied a Super Bowl record with three sacks . Jordan Norwood 's 61-yard punt return set a new record , surpassing the old record of 45 yards set by John Taylor in Super Bowl XXIII . Denver was just 1-of-14 on third down , while Carolina was barely better at 3-of-15 . The two teams ' combined third down conversion percentage of 13.8 was a Super Bowl low . Manning and Newton had quarterback passer ratings of 56.6 and 55.4 , respectively , and their added total of 112 is a record lowest aggregate passer rating for a Super Bowl . Manning became the oldest quarterback ever to win a Super Bowl at age 39 , and the first quarterback ever to win a Super Bowl with two different teams , while Gary Kubiak became the first head coach to win a Super Bowl with the same franchise he went to the Super Bowl with as a player .
Luther 's final journey , to Mansfeld , was taken because of his concern for his siblings ' families continuing in their father Hans Luther 's copper mining trade . Their livelihood was threatened by Count Albrecht of Mansfeld bringing the industry under his own control . The controversy that ensued involved all four Mansfeld counts : Albrecht , Philip , John George , and Gerhard . Luther journeyed to Mansfeld twice in late 1545 to participate in the negotiations for a settlement , and a third visit was needed in early 1546 for their completion .
The Sydney Mandolins ( Artistic Director : Adrian Hooper ) have contributed greatly to the repertoire through commissioning over 200 works by Australian and International composers . Most of these works have been released on Compact Disks and can regularly be heard on radio stations on the ABC and MBS networks . One of their members , mandolin virtuoso Paul Hooper , has had a number of Concertos written for him by composers such as Eric Gross . He has performed and recorded these works with the Sydney Symphony Orchestra and the Tasmanian Symphony Orchestra . As well , Paul Hooper has had many solo works dedicated to him by Australian composers e.g. , Caroline Szeto , Ian Shanahan , Larry Sitsky and Michael Smetanin .
Luther objected to a saying attributed to Johann Tetzel that " As soon as the coin in the coffer rings , the soul from purgatory ( also attested as 'into heaven ' ) springs . "
As the designated home team in the annual rotation between AFC and NFC teams , the Broncos elected to wear their road white jerseys with matching white pants . Elway stated , " We 've had Super Bowl success in our white uniforms . " The Broncos last wore matching white jerseys and pants in the Super Bowl in Super Bowl XXXIII , Elway 's last game as Denver QB , when they defeated the Atlanta Falcons 34–19 . In their only other Super Bowl win in Super Bowl XXXII , Denver wore blue jerseys , which was their primary color at the time . They also lost Super Bowl XXI when they wore white jerseys , but they are 0-4 in Super Bowls when wearing orange jerseys , losing in Super Bowl XII , XXII , XXIV , and XLVIII . The only other AFC champion team to have worn white as the designated home team in the Super Bowl was the Pittsburgh Steelers ; they defeated the Seattle Seahawks 21–10 in Super Bowl XL 10 seasons prior . The Broncos ' decision to wear white meant the Panthers would wear their standard home uniform : black jerseys with silver pants .
Also in late 1965 , the Date subsidiary label was revived . This label released the first string of hits for Peaches & Herb and scored a few minor hits from various other artists . Date 's biggest success was " Time of the Season " by the Zombies , peaking at # 2 in 1969 . The label was discontinued in 1970 .
The mandolin has been used extensively in the traditional music of England and Scotland for generations . Simon Mayor is a prominent British player who has produced six solo albums , instructional books and DVDs , as well as recordings with his mandolin quartet the Mandolinquents . The instrument has also found its way into British rock music . The mandolin was played by Mike Oldfield ( and introduced by Vivian Stanshall ) on Oldfield 's album Tubular Bells , as well as on a number of his subsequent albums ( particularly prominently on Hergest Ridge ( 1974 ) and Ommadawn ( 1975 ) ) . It was used extensively by the British folk-rock band Lindisfarne , who featured two members on the instrument , Ray Jackson and Simon Cowe , and whose " Fog on the Tyne " was the biggest selling UK album of 1971-1972 . The instrument was also used extensively in the UK folk revival of the 1960s and 1970s with bands such as Fairport Convention and Steeleye Span taking it on as the lead instrument in many of their songs . Maggie May by Rod Stewart , which hit No . 1 on both the British charts and the Billboard Hot 100 , also featured Jackson 's playing . It has also been used by other British rock musicians . Led Zeppelin 's bassist John Paul Jones is an accomplished mandolin player and has recorded numerous songs on mandolin including Going to California and That 's the Way ; the mandolin part on The Battle of Evermore is played by Jimmy Page , who composed the song . Other Led Zeppelin songs featuring mandolin are Hey Hey What Can I Do , and Black Country Woman . Pete Townshend of The Who played mandolin on the track Mike Post Theme , along with many other tracks on Endless Wire . McGuinness Flint , for whom Graham Lyle played the mandolin on their most successful single , When I 'm Dead And Gone , is another example . Lyle was also briefly a member of Ronnie Lane 's Slim Chance , and played mandolin on their hit How Come . One of the more prominent early mandolin players in popular music was Robin Williamson in The Incredible String Band . Ian Anderson of Jethro Tull is a highly accomplished mandolin player ( beautiful track Pussy Willow ) , as is his guitarist Martin Barre . The popular song Please Please Please Let Me Get What I Want by The Smiths featured a mandolin solo played by Johnny Marr . More recently , the Glasgow-based band Sons and Daughters featured the mandolin , played by Ailidh Lennon , on tracks such as Fight , Start to End , and Medicine . British folk-punk icons the Levellers also regularly use the mandolin in their songs . Current bands are also beginning to use the Mandolin and its unique sound - such as South London 's Indigo Moss who use it throughout their recordings and live gigs . The mandolin has also featured in the playing of Matthew Bellamy in the rock band Muse . It also forms the basis of Paul McCartney 's 2007 hit " Dance Tonight . " That was not the first time a Beatle played a mandolin , however ; that distinction goes to George Harrison on Gone Troppo , the title cut from the 1982 album of the same name . The mandolin is taught in Lanarkshire by the Lanarkshire Guitar and Mandolin Association to over 100 people .

In the post-apartheid era , the Constitution of South Africa has declared the country to be a " Non-racial democracy " . In an effort to redress past injustices , the ANC government has introduced laws in support of affirmative action policies for Blacks ; under these they define " Black " people to include " Africans " , " Coloureds " and " Asians " . Some affirmative action policies favor " Africans " over " Coloureds " in terms of qualifying for certain benefits . Some South Africans categorized as " African Black " say that " Coloureds " did not suffer as much as they did during apartheid . " Coloured " South Africans are known to discuss their dilemma by saying , " we were not white enough under apartheid , and we are not black enough under the ANC ( African National Congress ) " .

The Charaka Samhita , thought to have been written between 300 and 500 AD , mentions a metal which , when oxidized , produces pushpanjan , thought to be zinc oxide . Zinc mines at Zawar , near Udaipur in India , have been active since the Mauryan period . The smelting of metallic zinc here , however , appears to have begun around the 12th century AD . One estimate is that this location produced an estimated million tonnes of metallic zinc and zinc oxide from the 12th to 16th centuries . Another estimate gives a total production of 60,000 tonnes of metallic zinc over this period . The Rasaratna Samuccaya , written in approximately the 13th century AD , mentions two types of zinc-containing ores : one used for metal extraction and another used for medicinal purposes .
There would be no more scoring in the third quarter , but early in the fourth , the Broncos drove to the Panthers 41-yard line . On the next play , Ealy knocked the ball out of Manning 's hand as he was winding up for a pass , and then recovered it for Carolina on the 50-yard line . A 16-yard reception by Devin Funchess and a 12-yard run by Stewart then set up Gano 's 39-yard field goal , cutting the Panthers deficit to one score at 16–10 . The next three drives of the game would end in punts .
Virgil 's biographical tradition is thought to depend on a lost biography by Varius , Virgil 's editor , which was incorporated into the biography by Suetonius and the commentaries of Servius and Donatus , the two great commentators on Virgil 's poetry . Although the commentaries no doubt record much factual information about Virgil , some of their evidence can be shown to rely on inferences made from his poetry and allegorizing ; thus , Virgil 's biographical tradition remains problematic .
The second half of the 20th century to the present has seen a gradual shift towards improved human rights for Aboriginal people . In a 1967 referendum over 90 % of the Australian population voted to end constitutional discrimination and to include Aborigines in the national census . During this period many Aboriginal activists began to embrace the term " black " and use their ancestry as a source of pride . Activist Bob Maza said :
For the first time , the Super Bowl 50 Host Committee and the NFL have openly sought disabled veteran and lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender-owned businesses in Business Connect , the Super Bowl program that provides local companies with contracting opportunities in and around the Super Bowl . The host committee has already raised over $ 40 million through sponsors including Apple , Google , Yahoo ! , Intel , Gap , Chevron , and Dignity Health .

In the 1530s and 1540s , printed images of Luther that emphasized his monumental size were crucial to the spread of Protestantism . In contrast to images of frail Catholic saints , Luther was presented as a stout man with a " double chin , strong mouth , piercing deep-set eyes , fleshy face , and squat neck . " He was shown to be physically imposing , an equal in stature to the secular German princes with whom he would join forces to spread Lutheranism . His large body also let the viewer know that he did not shun earthly pleasures like drinking—behavior that was a stark contrast to the ascetic life of the medieval religious orders . Famous images from this period include the woodcuts by Hans Brosamer ( 1530 ) and Lucas Cranach the Elder and Lucas Cranach the Younger ( 1546 ) .
Without Luther 's backing for the uprising , many rebels laid down their weapons ; others felt betrayed . Their defeat by the Swabian League at the Battle of Frankenhausen on 15 May 1525 , followed by Müntzer 's execution , brought the revolutionary stage of the Reformation to a close . Thereafter , radicalism found a refuge in the anabaptist movement and other religious movements , while Luther 's Reformation flourished under the wing of the secular powers .
During Mubarak 's reign , the political scene was dominated by the National Democratic Party , which was created by Sadat in 1978 . It passed the 1993 Syndicates Law , 1995 Press Law , and 1999 Nongovernmental Associations Law which hampered freedoms of association and expression by imposing new regulations and draconian penalties on violations . [ citation needed ] As a result , by the late 1990s parliamentary politics had become virtually irrelevant and alternative avenues for political expression were curtailed as well .
Martin Luther was born to Hans Luder ( or Ludher , later Luther ) and his wife Margarethe ( née Lindemann ) on 10 November 1483 in Eisleben , Saxony , then part of the Holy Roman Empire . He was baptized as a Catholic the next morning on the feast day of St. Martin of Tours . His family moved to Mansfeld in 1484 , where his father was a leaseholder of copper mines and smelters and served as one of four citizen representatives on the local council . The religious scholar Martin Marty describes Luther 's mother as a hard-working woman of " trading-class stock and middling means " and notes that Luther 's enemies later wrongly described her as a whore and bath attendant . He had several brothers and sisters , and is known to have been close to one of them , Jacob . Hans Luther was ambitious for himself and his family , and he was determined to see Martin , his eldest son , become a lawyer . He sent Martin to Latin schools in Mansfeld , then Magdeburg in 1497 , where he attended a school operated by a lay group called the Brethren of the Common Life , and Eisenach in 1498 . The three schools focused on the so-called " trivium " : grammar , rhetoric , and logic . Luther later compared his education there to purgatory and hell .
Anthropologists have most frequently employed the term 'identity ' to refer to this idea of selfhood in a loosely Eriksonian way ( Erikson 1972 ) properties based on the uniqueness and individuality which makes a person distinct from others . Identity became of more interest to anthropologists with the emergence of modern concerns with ethnicity and social movements in the 1970s . This was reinforced by an appreciation , following the trend in sociological thought , of the manner in which the individual is affected by and contributes to the overall social context . At the same time , the Eriksonian approach to identity remained in force , with the result that identity has continued until recently to be used in a largely socio-historical way to refer to qualities of sameness in relation to a person 's connection to others and to a particular group of people .
Many adaptations of the instrument have been done to cater to the special needs of Indian Carnatic music . In Indian classical music and Indian light music , the mandolin , which bears little resemblance to the European mandolin , is usually tuned E-B-E-B . As there is no concept of absolute pitch in Indian classical music , any convenient tuning maintaining these relative pitch intervals between the strings can be used . Another prevalent tuning with these intervals is C-G-C-G , which corresponds to Sa-Pa-Sa-Pa in the Indian carnatic classical music style . This tuning corresponds to the way violins are tuned for carnatic classical music . This type of mandolin is also used in Bhangra , dance music popular in Punjabi culture .
In September 2015 , the 193 member states of the United Nations unanimously adopted the Sustainable Development Goals , a set of 17 goals aiming to transform the world over the next 15 years . These goals are designed to eliminate poverty , discrimination , abuse and preventable deaths , address environmental destruction , and usher in an era of development for all people , everywhere .

In 1521 Luther dealt largely with prophecy , in which he broadened the foundations of the Reformation placing them on prophetic faith . His main interest was centered on the prophecy of the Little Horn in Daniel 8:9–12 , 23–25 . The antichrist of 2 Thessalonians 2 was identified as the power of the Papacy . So too was the Little Horn of Daniel 7 , coming up among the divisions of Rome , explicitly applied .

In 1839 Mariano Spada ( 1796 - 1872 ) , professor of theology at the Roman College of Saint Thomas , published Esame Critico sulla dottrina dell ’ Angelico Dottore S. Tommaso di Aquino circa il Peccato originale , relativamente alla Beatissima Vergine Maria [ A critical examination of the doctrine of St. Thomas Aquinas , the Angelic Doctor , regarding original sin with respect to the Most Blessed Virgin Mary ] , in which Aquinas is interpreted not as treating the question of the Immaculate Conception later formulated in the papal bull Ineffabilis Deus but rather the sanctification of the fetus within Mary 's womb . Spada furnished an interpretation whereby Pius IX was relieved of the problem of seeming to foster a doctrine not in agreement with the Aquinas ' teaching . Pope Pius IX would later appoint Spada Master of the Sacred Palace in 1867 .
In 2000 [ update ] , there were 94,367 workers who commuted into the municipality and 16,424 workers who commuted away . The municipality is a net importer of workers , with about 5.7 workers entering the municipality for every one leaving . Of the working population , 50.6 % used public transport to get to work , and 20.6 % used a private car .
Concerns were raised over whether Levi 's Stadium 's field was of a high enough quality to host a Super Bowl ; during the inaugural season , the field had to be re-sodded multiple times due to various issues , and during a week 6 game earlier in the 2015 season , a portion of the turf collapsed under Baltimore Ravens kicker Justin Tucker , causing him to slip and miss a field goal , although the field has not had any major issues since . As is customary for Super Bowl games played at natural grass stadiums , the NFL re-sodded the field with a new playing surface ; a hybrid Bermuda 419 turf . NFL and Atlanta Braves field director Ed Mangan stated that the field was in " great shape " for gameday . However , the turf showed problem throughout the game , with a number of players needing to change their cleats during the game and player slipping during plays all throughout the game .
Economic conditions have started to improve considerably , after a period of stagnation , due to the adoption of more liberal economic policies by the government as well as increased revenues from tourism and a booming stock market . In its annual report , the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) has rated Egypt as one of the top countries in the world undertaking economic reforms . Some major economic reforms undertaken by the government since 2003 include a dramatic slashing of customs and tariffs . A new taxation law implemented in 2005 decreased corporate taxes from 40 % to the current 20 % , resulting in a stated 100 % increase in tax revenue by the year 2006 .
The Romans interacted with and later conquered parts of Mauretania , an early state that covered modern Morocco , western Algeria , and the Spanish cities Ceuta and Melilla during the classical period . The people of the region were noted in Classical literature as Mauri , which was subsequently rendered as Moors in English .
An apoplectic stroke deprived him of his speech , and he died shortly afterwards at 2:45 a.m. on 18 February 1546 , aged 62 , in Eisleben , the city of his birth . He was buried in the Castle Church in Wittenberg , beneath the pulpit . The funeral was held by his friends Johannes Bugenhagen and Philipp Melanchthon . A year later , troops of Luther 's adversary Charles V , Holy Roman Emperor entered the town , but were ordered by Charles not to disturb the grave .
Luther wrote about the Jews throughout his career , though only a few of his works dealt with them directly . Luther rarely encountered Jews during his life , but his attitudes reflected a theological and cultural tradition which saw Jews as a rejected people guilty of the murder of Christ , and he lived within a local community that had expelled Jews some ninety years earlier . He considered the Jews blasphemers and liars because they rejected the divinity of Jesus , whereas Christians believed Jesus was the Messiah . But Luther believed that all human beings who set themselves against God were equally guilty . As early as 1516 , he wrote that many people " are proud with marvelous stupidity when they call the Jews dogs , evildoers , or whatever they like , while they too , and equally , do not realize who or what they are in the sight of God " . In 1523 , Luther advised kindness toward the Jews in That Jesus Christ was Born a Jew and also aimed to convert them to Christianity . When his efforts at conversion failed , he grew increasingly bitter toward them . In his 2010 book Bonhoeffer : Pastor , Martyr , Prophet , Spy , Christian author Eric Metaxas claimed that Luther 's attitude towards Jews " unraveled along with his health . "
A mandolin ( Italian : mandolino pronounced [ mandoˈliːno ] ; literally " small mandola " ) is a musical instrument in the lute family and is usually plucked with a plectrum or " pick " . It commonly has four courses of doubled metal strings tuned in unison ( 8 strings ) , although five ( 10 strings ) and six ( 12 strings ) course versions also exist . The courses are normally tuned in a succession of perfect fifths . It is the soprano member of a family that includes the mandola , octave mandolin , mandocello and mandobass .
Established acts benefited from the new commercial climate , with Whitesnake 's self-titled album ( 1987 ) selling over 17 million copies , outperforming anything in Coverdale 's or Deep Purple 's catalogue before or since . It featured the rock anthem " Here I Go Again '87 " as one of 4 UK top 20 singles . The follow-up Slip of the Tongue ( 1989 ) went platinum , but according to critics Steve Erlwine and Greg Prato , " it was a considerable disappointment after the across-the-board success of Whitesnake " . Aerosmith 's comeback album Permanent Vacation ( 1987 ) would begin a decade long revival of their popularity . Crazy Nights ( 1987 ) by Kiss was the band 's highest charting release in the US since 1979 and the highest of their career in the UK . Mötley Crüe with Girls , Girls , Girls ( 1987 ) continued their commercial success and Def Leppard with Hysteria ( 1987 ) hit their commercial peak , the latter producing seven hit singles ( a record for a hard rock act ) . Guns N ' Roses released the best-selling début of all time , Appetite for Destruction ( 1987 ) . With a " grittier " and " rawer " sound than most glam metal , it produced three top 10 hits , including the number one " Sweet Child O ' Mine " . Some of the glam rock bands that formed in the mid-1980s , such as White Lion and Cinderella experienced their biggest success during this period with their respective albums Pride ( 1987 ) and Long Cold Winter ( 1988 ) both going multi-platinum and launching a series of hit singles . In the last years of the decade , the most notable successes were New Jersey ( 1988 ) by Bon Jovi , OU812 ( 1988 ) by Van Halen , Open Up and Say ... Ahh ! ( 1988 ) by Poison , Pump ( 1989 ) by Aerosmith , and Mötley Crüe 's most commercially successful album Dr. Feelgood ( 1989 ) . New Jersey spawned five Top 10 singles , a record for a hard rock act . In 1988 from 25 June to 5 November , the number one spot on the Billboard 200 album chart was held by a hard rock album for 18 out of 20 consecutive weeks ; the albums were OU812 , Hysteria , Appetite for Destruction , and New Jersey . A final wave of glam rock bands arrived in the late 1980s , and experienced success with multi-platinum albums and hit singles from 1989 until the early 1990s , among them Extreme , Warrant Slaughter and FireHouse . Skid Row also released their eponymous début ( 1989 ) , reaching number six on the Billboard 200 , but they were to be one of the last major bands that emerged in the glam rock era .
The rise of Islam , based on both the Qur'an and Muhammad strongly altered the power balances and perceptions of origin of power in the Mediterranean region . Early Islamic philosophy emphasized an inexorable link between science and religion , and the process of ijtihad to find truth—in effect all philosophy was " political " as it had real implications for governance . This view was challenged by the " rationalist " Mutazilite philosophers , who held a more Hellenic view , reason above revelation , and as such are known to modern scholars as the first speculative theologians of Islam ; they were supported by a secular aristocracy who sought freedom of action independent of the Caliphate . By the late ancient period , however , the " traditionalist " Asharite view of Islam had in general triumphed . According to the Asharites , reason must be subordinate to the Quran and the Sunna .

Luther 's Small Catechism proved especially effective in helping parents teach their children ; likewise the Larger Catechism was effective for pastors . Using the German vernacular , they expressed the Apostles ' Creed in simpler , more personal , Trinitarian language . He rewrote each article of the Creed to express the character of the Father , the Son , or the Holy Spirit . Luther 's goal was to enable the catechumens to see themselves as a personal object of the work of the three persons of the Trinity , each of which works in the catechumen 's life . That is , Luther depicted the Trinity not as a doctrine to be learned , but as persons to be known . The Father creates , the Son redeems , and the Spirit sanctifies , a divine unity with separate personalities . Salvation originates with the Father and draws the believer to the Father . Luther 's treatment of the Apostles ' Creed must be understood in the context of the Decalogue ( the Ten Commandments ) and the Lord 's Prayer , which are also part of the Lutheran catechical teaching .
Doug Morris , who was head of Warner Music Group , then Universal Music , became chairman and CEO of the company on July 1 , 2011 . Sony Music underwent a restructuring after Morris ' arrival . He was joined by L.A. Reid , who became the chairman and CEO of Epic Records . Under Reid , multiple artists from the Jive half of the former RCA/Jive Label Group moved to Epic . Peter Edge became the new CEO of the RCA Records unit . The RCA Music Group closed down Arista , J Records and Jive Records in October 2011 , with the artists from those labels being moved to RCA Records .
Pope Leo X was used to reformers and heretics , and he responded slowly , " with great care as is proper . " Over the next three years he deployed a series of papal theologians and envoys against Luther , which served only to harden the reformer 's anti-papal theology . First , the Dominican theologian Sylvester Mazzolini drafted a heresy case against Luther , whom Leo then summoned to Rome . The Elector Frederick persuaded the pope to have Luther examined at Augsburg , where the Imperial Diet was held . There , in October 1518 , under questioning by papal legate Cardinal Cajetan Luther stated that he did not consider the papacy part of the biblical Church because historistical interpretation of Bible prophecy concluded that the papacy was the Antichrist . The prophecies concerning the Antichrist soon became the center of controversy . The hearings degenerated into a shouting match . More than his writing the 95 Theses , Luther 's confrontation with the church cast him as an enemy of the pope . Cajetan 's original instructions had been to arrest Luther if he failed to recant , but the legate desisted from doing so . Luther slipped out of the city at night , unbeknownst to Cajetan .
CBS set the base rate for a 30-second advertisement at $ 5,000,000 , a record high price for a Super Bowl ad . As of January 26 , the advertisements had not yet sold out . CBS mandated that all advertisers purchase a package covering time on both the television and digital broadcasts of the game , meaning that for the first time , digital streams of the game would carry all national advertising in pattern with the television broadcast . This would be the final year in a multi-year contract with Anheuser-Busch InBev that allowed the beer manufacturer to air multiple advertisements during the game at a steep discount . It was also the final year that Doritos , a longtime sponsor of the game , held its " Crash the Super Bowl " contest that allowed viewers to create their own Doritos ads for a chance to have it aired during the game . Nintendo and The Pokémon Company also made their Super Bowl debut , promoting the 20th anniversary of the Pokémon video game and media franchise .
Bern is also served by Bern Airport , located outside the city near the town of Belp . The regional airport , colloquially called Bern-Belp or Belpmoos , is connected to several European cities . Additionally Zürich Airport , Geneva Airport and EuroAirport Basel-Mulhouse-Freiburg also serve as international gateways , all reachable within two hours by car or train from Bern .
Established bands made something of a comeback in the mid-1980s . After an 8-year separation , Deep Purple returned with the classic Machine Head line-up to produce Perfect Strangers ( 1984 ) , which reached number five in the UK , hit the top five in five other countries , and was a platinum-seller in the US . After somewhat slower sales of its fourth album , Fair Warning , Van Halen rebounded with the Top 3 album Diver Down in 1982 , then reached their commercial pinnacle with 1984 . It reached number two on the Billboard album chart and provided the track " Jump " , which reached number one on the singles chart and remained there for several weeks . Heart , after floundering during the first half of the decade , made a comeback with their eponymous ninth studio album which hit number one and contained four Top 10 singles including their first number one hit . The new medium of video channels was used with considerable success by bands formed in previous decades . Among the first were ZZ Top , who mixed hard blues rock with new wave music to produce a series of highly successful singles , beginning with " Gim me All Your Lovin ' " ( 1983 ) , which helped their albums Eliminator ( 1983 ) and Afterburner ( 1985 ) achieve diamond and multi-platinum status respectively . Others found renewed success in the singles charts with power ballads , including REO Speedwagon with " Keep on Loving You " ( 1980 ) and " Ca n't Fight This Feeling " ( 1984 ) , Journey with " Do n't Stop Believin ' " ( 1981 ) and " Open Arms " ( 1982 ) , Foreigner 's " I Want to Know What Love Is " , Scorpions ' " Still Loving You " ( both from 1984 ) , Heart ’ s " What About Love " ( 1985 ) and " These Dreams " ( 1986 ) , and Boston 's " Amanda " ( 1986 ) .
According to the tradition , Virgil traveled to Greece in about 19 BC to revise the Aeneid . After meeting Augustus in Athens and deciding to return home , Virgil caught a fever while visiting a town near Megara . After crossing to Italy by ship , weakened with disease , Virgil died in Brundisium harbor on September 21 , 19 BC . Augustus ordered Virgil 's literary executors , Lucius Varius Rufus and Plotius Tucca , to disregard Virgil 's own wish that the poem be burned , instead ordering it published with as few editorial changes as possible . As a result , the text of the Aeneid that exists may contain faults which Virgil was planning to correct before publication . However , the only obvious imperfections are a few lines of verse that are metrically unfinished ( i.e . not a complete line of dactylic hexameter ) . Some scholars have argued that Virgil deliberately left these metrically incomplete lines for dramatic effect . Other alleged imperfections are subject to scholarly debate .
Egypt actively practices capital punishment . Egypt 's authorities do not release figures on death sentences and executions , despite repeated requests over the years by human rights organisations . The United Nations human rights office and various NGOs expressed " deep alarm " after an Egyptian Minya Criminal Court sentenced 529 people to death in a single hearing on 25 March 2014 . Sentenced supporters of former President Mohamed Morsi will be executed for their alleged role in violence following his ousting in July 2013 . The judgment was condemned as a violation of international law . By May 2014 , approximately 16,000 people ( and as high as more than 40,000 by one independent count ) , mostly Brotherhood members or supporters , have been imprisoned after the coup after the Muslim Brotherhood was labelled as terrorist organisation by the post-coup interim Egyptian government .
On 28 February 1476 , Pope Sixtus IV , authorized those dioceses that wished to introduce the feast to do so , and introduced it to his own diocese of Rome in 1477 , with a specially composed Mass and Office of the feast . With his bull Cum praeexcelsa of 28 February 1477 , in which he referred to the feast as that of the Conception of Mary , without using the word " Immaculate " , he granted indulgences to those who would participate in the specially composed Mass or Office on the feast itself or during its octave , and he used the word " immaculate " of Mary , but applied instead the adjective " miraculous " to her conception . On 4 September 1483 , referring to the feast as that of " the Conception of Immaculate Mary ever Virgin " , he condemned both those who called it mortally sinful and heretical to hold that the " glorious and immaculate mother of God was conceived without the stain of original sin " and those who called it mortally sinful and heretical to hold that " the glorious Virgin Mary was conceived with original sin " , since , he said , " up to this time there has been no decision made by the Roman Church and the Apostolic See . " This decree was reaffirmed by the Council of Trent .
On Carolina 's next possession fullback Mike Tolbert lost a fumble while being tackled by safety Darian Stewart , which linebacker Danny Trevathan recovered on the Broncos 40-yard line . However , the Panthers soon took the ball back when defensive end Kony Ealy tipped a Manning pass to himself and then intercepted it , returning the ball 19 yards to the Panthers 39-yard line with 1:55 left on the clock . The Panthers could not gain any yards with their possession and had to punt . After a Denver punt , Carolina drove to the Broncos 45-yard line . But with 11 seconds left , Newton was sacked by DeMarcus Ware as time expired in the half .
In the 1960s , American and British blues and rock bands began to modify rock and roll by adding harder sounds , heavier guitar riffs , bombastic drumming , and louder vocals , from electric blues . Early forms of hard rock can be heard in the work of Chicago blues musicians Elmore James , Muddy Waters , and Howlin ' Wolf , The Kingsmen 's version of " Louie Louie " ( 1963 ) which made it a garage rock standard , and the songs of rhythm and blues influenced British Invasion acts , including " You Really Got Me " by The Kinks ( 1964 ) , " My Generation " by The Who ( 1965 ) , " Shapes of Things " ( 1966 ) by The Yardbirds and " ( I Ca n't Get No ) Satisfaction " ( 1965 ) by The Rolling Stones . From the late 1960s , it became common to divide mainstream rock music that emerged from psychedelia into soft and hard rock . Soft rock was often derived from folk rock , using acoustic instruments and putting more emphasis on melody and harmonies . In contrast , hard rock was most often derived from blues rock and was played louder and with more intensity .
On June 4 , 2014 , the NFL announced that the practice of branding Super Bowl games with Roman numerals , a practice established at Super Bowl V , would be temporarily suspended , and that the game would be named using Arabic numerals as Super Bowl 50 as opposed to Super Bowl L. The use of Roman numerals will be reinstated for Super Bowl LI . Jaime Weston , the league 's vice president of brand and creative , explained that a primary reason for the change was the difficulty of designing an aesthetically pleasing logo with the letter " L " using the standardized logo template introduced at Super Bowl XLV . The logo also deviates from the template by featuring large numerals , colored in gold , behind the Vince Lombardi Trophy , instead of underneath and in silver as in the standard logo .
Despite some concerns , western vegetarians and vegans have not been found to suffer from overt zinc deficiencies any more than meat-eaters . Major plant sources of zinc include cooked dried beans , sea vegetables , fortified cereals , soyfoods , nuts , peas , and seeds . However , phytates in many whole-grains and fiber in many foods may interfere with zinc absorption and marginal zinc intake has poorly understood effects . The zinc chelator phytate , found in seeds and cereal bran , can contribute to zinc malabsorption . There is some evidence to suggest that more than the US RDA ( 15 mg ) of zinc daily may be needed in those whose diet is high in phytates , such as some vegetarians . These considerations must be balanced against the fact that there is a paucity of adequate zinc biomarkers , and the most widely used indicator , plasma zinc , has poor sensitivity and specificity . Diagnosing zinc deficiency is a persistent challenge .
The element was probably named by the alchemist Paracelsus after the German word Zinke ( prong , tooth ) . German chemist Andreas Sigismund Marggraf is credited with discovering pure metallic zinc in 1746 . Work by Luigi Galvani and Alessandro Volta uncovered the electrochemical properties of zinc by 1800 . Corrosion-resistant zinc plating of iron ( hot-dip galvanizing ) is the major application for zinc . Other applications are in batteries , small non-structural castings , and alloys , such as brass . A variety of zinc compounds are commonly used , such as zinc carbonate and zinc gluconate ( as dietary supplements ) , zinc chloride ( in deodorants ) , zinc pyrithione ( anti-dandruff shampoos ) , zinc sulfide ( in luminescent paints ) , and zinc methyl or zinc diethyl in the organic laboratory .
The annual NFL Experience was held at the Moscone Center in San Francisco . In addition , " Super Bowl City " opened on January 30 at Justin Herman Plaza on The Embarcadero , featuring games and activities that will highlight the Bay Area 's technology , culinary creations , and cultural diversity . More than 1 million people are expected to attend the festivities in San Francisco during Super Bowl Week . San Francisco mayor Ed Lee said of the highly visible homeless presence in this area " they are going to have to leave " . San Francisco city supervisor Jane Kim unsuccessfully lobbied for the NFL to reimburse San Francisco for city services in the amount of $ 5 million .

In the post-apartheid era , the Constitution of South Africa has declared the country to be a " Non-racial democracy " . In an effort to redress past injustices , the ANC government has introduced laws in support of affirmative action policies for Blacks ; under these they define " Black " people to include " Africans " , " Coloureds " and " Asians " . Some affirmative action policies favor " Africans " over " Coloureds " in terms of qualifying for certain benefits . Some South Africans categorized as " African Black " say that " Coloureds " did not suffer as much as they did during apartheid . " Coloured " South Africans are known to discuss their dilemma by saying , " we were not white enough under apartheid , and we are not black enough under the ANC ( African National Congress ) " .

The Egyptians were one of the first major civilisations to codify design elements in art and architecture . Egyptian blue , also known as calcium copper silicate is a pigment used by Egyptians for thousands of years . It is considered to be the first synthetic pigment . The wall paintings done in the service of the Pharaohs followed a rigid code of visual rules and meanings . Egyptian civilisation is renowned for its colossal pyramids , temples and monumental tombs . Well-known examples are the Pyramid of Djoser designed by ancient architect and engineer Imhotep , the Sphinx , and the temple of Abu Simbel . Modern and contemporary Egyptian art can be as diverse as any works in the world art scene , from the vernacular architecture of Hassan Fathy and Ramses Wissa Wassef , to Mahmoud Mokhtar 's sculptures , to the distinctive Coptic iconography of Isaac Fanous . The Cairo Opera House serves as the main performing arts venue in the Egyptian capital .
The element was probably named by the alchemist Paracelsus after the German word Zinke ( prong , tooth ) . German chemist Andreas Sigismund Marggraf is credited with discovering pure metallic zinc in 1746 . Work by Luigi Galvani and Alessandro Volta uncovered the electrochemical properties of zinc by 1800 . Corrosion-resistant zinc plating of iron ( hot-dip galvanizing ) is the major application for zinc . Other applications are in batteries , small non-structural castings , and alloys , such as brass . A variety of zinc compounds are commonly used , such as zinc carbonate and zinc gluconate ( as dietary supplements ) , zinc chloride ( in deodorants ) , zinc pyrithione ( anti-dandruff shampoos ) , zinc sulfide ( in luminescent paints ) , and zinc methyl or zinc diethyl in the organic laboratory .
Binary compounds of zinc are known for most of the metalloids and all the nonmetals except the noble gases . The oxide ZnO is a white powder that is nearly insoluble in neutral aqueous solutions , but is amphoteric , dissolving in both strong basic and acidic solutions . The other chalcogenides ( ZnS , ZnSe , and ZnTe ) have varied applications in electronics and optics . Pnictogenides ( Zn 3N 2 , Zn 3P 2 , Zn 3As 2 and Zn 3Sb 2 ) , the peroxide ( ZnO 2 ) , the hydride ( ZnH 2 ) , and the carbide ( ZnC 2 ) are also known . Of the four halides , ZnF 2 has the most ionic character , whereas the others ( ZnCl 2 , ZnBr 2 , and ZnI 2 ) have relatively low melting points and are considered to have more covalent character .
The flagship stations of each station in the markets of each team will carry their local play-by-play calls . In Denver , KOA ( 850 AM ) and KRFX ( 103.5 FM ) will carry the game , with Dave Logan on play-by-play and Ed McCaffrey on color commentary . In North Carolina , WBT ( 1110 AM ) will carry the game , with Mick Mixon on play-by-play and Eugene Robinson and Jim Szoke on color commentary . WBT will also simulcast the game on its sister station WBT-FM ( 99.3 FM ) , which is based in Chester , South Carolina . As KOA and WBT are both clear-channel stations , the local broadcasts will be audible over much of the western United States after sunset ( for Denver ) and the eastern United States throughout the game ( for Carolina ) . In accordance with contractual rules , the rest of the stations in the Broncos and Panthers radio networks will either carry the Westwood One feed or not carry the game at all .
Other scholars argue that , even if his views were merely anti-Judaic—that is , opposed to Judaism and its adherence rather than the Jews as an ethnic group—their violence lent a new element to the standard Christian suspicion of Judaism . Ronald Berger writes that Luther is credited with " Germanizing the Christian critique of Judaism and establishing anti-Semitism as a key element of German culture and national identity . " Paul Rose argues that he caused a " hysterical and demonizing mentality " about Jews to enter German thought and discourse , a mentality that might otherwise have been absent . Christopher J. Probst in his book Demonizing the Jews : Luther and the Protestant Church in Nazi Germany ( 2012 ) , shows that a large number of German Lutheran clergy and theologians during the Nazi Third Reich used Luther 's hostile publications towards the Jews and their Jewish religion to justify at least in part the anti-Semitic policies of the National Socialists .
Hard rock is a form of loud , aggressive rock music . The electric guitar is often emphasised , used with distortion and other effects , both as a rhythm instrument using repetitive riffs with a varying degree of complexity , and as a solo lead instrument . Drumming characteristically focuses on driving rhythms , strong bass drum and a backbeat on snare , sometimes using cymbals for emphasis . The bass guitar works in conjunction with the drums , occasionally playing riffs , but usually providing a backing for the rhythm and lead guitars . Vocals are often growling , raspy , or involve screaming or wailing , sometimes in a high range , or even falsetto voice .
Similar alloys with the addition of a small amount of lead can be cold-rolled into sheets . An alloy of 96 % zinc and 4 % aluminium is used to make stamping dies for low production run applications for which ferrous metal dies would be too expensive . In building facades , roofs or other applications in which zinc is used as sheet metal and for methods such as deep drawing , roll forming or bending , zinc alloys with titanium and copper are used . Unalloyed zinc is too brittle for these kinds of manufacturing processes .
Albert Einstein lived in a flat at the Kramgasse 49 , the site of the Einsteinhaus , from 1903 to 1905 , the year in which the Annus Mirabilis Papers were published .
The report " Mary : Faith and Hope in Christ " , by the Anglican-Roman Catholic International Commission , concluded that the teaching about Mary in the two definitions of the Assumption and the Immaculate Conception can be said to be consonant with the teaching of the Scriptures and the ancient common traditions . But the report expressed concerns that the Roman Catholic dogmatic definitions of these concepts implies them to be " revealed by God " , stating : " The question arises for Anglicans , however , as to whether these doctrines concerning Mary are revealed by God in a way which must be held by believers as a matter of faith . "
In 1353 Bern joined the Swiss Confederacy , becoming one of the eight cantons of the formative period of 1353 to 1481 . Bern invaded and conquered Aargau in 1415 and Vaud in 1536 , as well as other smaller territories ; thereby becoming the largest city-state north of the Alps , by the 18th century comprising most of what is today the canton of Bern and the canton of Vaud .
The Panthers offense , which led the NFL in scoring ( 500 points ) , was loaded with talent , boasting six Pro Bowl selections . Pro Bowl quarterback Cam Newton had one of his best seasons , throwing for 3,837 yards and rushing for 636 , while recording a career-high and league-leading 45 total touchdowns ( 35 passing , 10 rushing ) , a career-low 10 interceptions , and a career-best quarterback rating of 99.4 . Newton 's leading receivers were tight end Greg Olsen , who caught a career-high 77 passes for 1,104 yards and seven touchdowns , and wide receiver Ted Ginn , Jr. , who caught 44 passes for 739 yards and 10 touchdowns ; Ginn also rushed for 60 yards and returned 27 punts for 277 yards . Other key receivers included veteran Jerricho Cotchery ( 39 receptions for 485 yards ) , rookie Devin Funchess ( 31 receptions for 473 yards and five touchdowns ) , and second-year receiver Corey Brown ( 31 receptions for 447 yards ) . The Panthers backfield featured Pro Bowl running back Jonathan Stewart , who led the team with 989 rushing yards and six touchdowns in 13 games , along with Pro Bowl fullback Mike Tolbert , who rushed for 256 yards and caught 18 passes for another 154 yards . Carolina 's offensive line also featured two Pro Bowl selections : center Ryan Kalil and guard Trai Turner .
Egypt has hosted several international competitions . the last one was 2009 FIFA U-20 World Cup which took place between 24 September - 16 October 2009 . On Friday 19 September of the year 2014 , Guinness World Records has announced that Egyptian scuba diver Ahmed Gabr is the new title holder for deepest salt water scuba dive , at 332.35 metres . Ahmed set a new world record Friday when he reached a depth of more than 1,000 feet . The 14-hour feat took Gabr 1,066 feet down into the abyss near the Egyptian town of Dahab in ther Red Sea , where he works as a diving instructor .
The cardinal protodeacon , the senior cardinal deacon in order of appointment to the College of Cardinals , has the privilege of announcing a new pope 's election and name ( once he has been ordained to the Episcopate ) from the central balcony at the Basilica of Saint Peter in Vatican City State . In the past , during papal coronations , the proto-deacon also had the honor of bestowing the pallium on the new pope and crowning him with the papal tiara . However , in 1978 Pope John Paul I chose not to be crowned and opted for a simpler papal inauguration ceremony , and his three successors followed that example . As a result , the Cardinal protodeacon 's privilege of crowning a new pope has effectively ceased although it could be revived if a future Pope were to restore a coronation ceremony . However , the proto-deacon still has the privilege of bestowing the pallium on a new pope at his papal inauguration . “ Acting in the place of the Roman Pontiff , he also confers the pallium upon metropolitan bishops or gives the pallium to their proxies. ” The current cardinal proto-deacon is Renato Raffaele Martino .
Luther wrote " Aus tiefer Not schrei ich zu dir " ( " From depths of woe I cry to you " ) in 1523 as a hymnic version of Psalm 130 and sent it as a sample to encourage evangelical colleagues to write psalm-hymns for use in German worship . In a collaboration with Paul Speratus , this and seven other hymns were published in the Achtliederbuch , the first Lutheran hymnal . In 1524 Luther developed his original four-stanza psalm paraphrase into a five-stanza Reformation hymn that developed the theme of " grace alone " more fully . Because it expressed essential Reformation doctrine , this expanded version of " Aus tiefer Not " was designated as a regular component of several regional Lutheran liturgies and was widely used at funerals , including Luther 's own . Along with Erhart Hegenwalt 's hymnic version of Psalm 51 , Luther 's expanded hymn was also adopted for use with the fifth part of Luther 's catechism , concerning confession .
In the United Kingdom , BBC Radio 5 Live and 5 Live Sports Extra will carry the contest . The BBC will carry its own British English broadcast , with Greg Brady , Darren Fletcher and Rocky Boiman on commentary .

William Champion 's brother , John , patented a process in 1758 for calcining zinc sulfide into an oxide usable in the retort process . Prior to this , only calamine could be used to produce zinc . In 1798 , Johann Christian Ruberg improved on the smelting process by building the first horizontal retort smelter . Jean-Jacques Daniel Dony built a different kind of horizontal zinc smelter in Belgium , which processed even more zinc . Italian doctor Luigi Galvani discovered in 1780 that connecting the spinal cord of a freshly dissected frog to an iron rail attached by a brass hook caused the frog 's leg to twitch . He incorrectly thought he had discovered an ability of nerves and muscles to create electricity and called the effect " animal electricity " . The galvanic cell and the process of galvanization were both named for Luigi Galvani and these discoveries paved the way for electrical batteries , galvanization and cathodic protection .
Zinc is included in most single tablet over-the-counter daily vitamin and mineral supplements . Preparations include zinc oxide , zinc acetate , and zinc gluconate . It is believed to possess antioxidant properties , which may protect against accelerated aging of the skin and muscles of the body ; studies differ as to its effectiveness . Zinc also helps speed up the healing process after an injury . It is also suspected of being beneficial to the body 's immune system . Indeed , zinc deficiency may have effects on virtually all parts of the human immune system .
The Panthers used the San Jose State practice facility and stayed at the San Jose Marriott . The Broncos practiced at Stanford University and stayed at the Santa Clara Marriott .
The Super Bowl 50 Host Committee has vowed to be " the most giving Super Bowl ever " , and will dedicate 25 percent of all money it raises for philanthropic causes in the Bay Area . The committee created the 50 fund as its philanthropic initiative and focuses on providing grants to aid with youth development , community investment and sustainable environments .
The annual NFL Experience was held at the Moscone Center in San Francisco . In addition , " Super Bowl City " opened on January 30 at Justin Herman Plaza on The Embarcadero , featuring games and activities that will highlight the Bay Area 's technology , culinary creations , and cultural diversity . More than 1 million people are expected to attend the festivities in San Francisco during Super Bowl Week . San Francisco mayor Ed Lee said of the highly visible homeless presence in this area " they are going to have to leave " . San Francisco city supervisor Jane Kim unsuccessfully lobbied for the NFL to reimburse San Francisco for city services in the amount of $ 5 million .
Johann Eck , speaking on behalf of the Empire as assistant of the Archbishop of Trier , presented Luther with copies of his writings laid out on a table and asked him if the books were his , and whether he stood by their contents . Luther confirmed he was their author , but requested time to think about the answer to the second question . He prayed , consulted friends , and gave his response the next day :
Virgin Media ( re-branded in 2007 from NTL : Telewest ) started to offer a high-definition television ( HDTV ) capable set top box , although from 30 November 2006 until 30 July 2009 it only carried one linear HD channel , BBC HD , after the conclusion of the ITV HD trial . Virgin Media has claimed that other HD channels were " locked up " or otherwise withheld from their platform , although Virgin Media did in fact have an option to carry Channel 4 HD in the future . Nonetheless , the linear channels were not offered , Virgin Media instead concentrating on its Video On Demand service to carry a modest selection of HD content . Virgin Media has nevertheless made a number of statements over the years , suggesting that more linear HD channels are on the way .
The Broncos defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers in the divisional round , 23–16 , by scoring 11 points in the final three minutes of the game . They then beat the defending Super Bowl XLIX champion New England Patriots in the AFC Championship Game , 20–18 , by intercepting a pass on New England 's 2-point conversion attempt with 17 seconds left on the clock . Despite Manning 's problems with interceptions during the season , he did n't throw any in their two playoff games .
The mandolin orchestras never completely went away , however . In fact , along with all the other musical forms the mandolin is involved with , the mandolin ensemble ( groups usually arranged like the string section of a modern symphony orchestra , with first mandolins , second mandolins , mandolas , mandocellos , mando-basses , and guitars , and sometimes supplemented by other instruments ) continues to grow in popularity . Since the mid-nineties , several public-school mandolin-based guitar programs have blossomed around the country , including Fretworks Mandolin and Guitar Orchestra , the first of its kind . The national organization , Classical Mandolin Society of America , founded by Norman Levine , represents these groups . Prominent modern mandolinists and composers for mandolin in the classical music tradition include Samuel Firstman , Howard Fry , Rudy Cipolla , Dave Apollon , Neil Gladd , Evan Marshall , Marilynn Mair and Mark Davis ( the Mair-Davis Duo ) , Brian Israel , David Evans , Emanuil Shynkman , Radim Zenkl , David Del Tredici and Ernst Krenek .
Luther refused to recant his writings . He is sometimes also quoted as saying : " Here I stand . I can do no other " . Recent scholars consider the evidence for these words to be unreliable , since they were inserted before " May God help me " only in later versions of the speech and not recorded in witness accounts of the proceedings . However , Mullett suggests that given his nature , " we are free to believe that Luther would tend to select the more dramatic form of words . "

The mandolin 's popularity in the United States was spurred by the success of a group of touring young European musicians known as the Estudiantina Figaro , or in the United States , simply the " Spanish Students . " The group landed in the U.S. on January 2 , 1880 in New York City , and played in Boston and New York to wildly enthusiastic crowds . Ironically , this ensemble did not play mandolins but rather bandurrias , which are also small , double-strung instruments that resemble the mandolin . The success of the Figaro Spanish Students spawned other groups who imitated their musical style and costumes . An Italian musician , Carlo Curti , hastily started a musical ensemble after seeing the Figaro Spanish Students perform ; his group of Italian born Americans called themselves the " Original Spanish Students , " counting on the American public to not know the difference between the Spanish bandurrias and Italian mandolins . The imitators ' use of mandolins helped to generate enormous public interest in an instrument previously relatively unknown in the United States .
Constitutional changes voted on 19 March 2007 prohibited parties from using religion as a basis for political activity , allowed the drafting of a new anti-terrorism law , authorised broad police powers of arrest and surveillance , and gave the president power to dissolve parliament and end judicial election monitoring . In 2009 , Dr. Ali El Deen Hilal Dessouki , Media Secretary of the National Democratic Party ( NDP ) , described Egypt as a " pharaonic " political system , and democracy as a " long-term goal " . Dessouki also stated that " the real center of power in Egypt is the military " .
The Canton of Bern school system provides one year of non-obligatory kindergarten , followed by six years of primary school . This is followed by three years of obligatory lower secondary school where the pupils are separated according to ability and aptitude . Following the lower secondary pupils may attend additional schooling or they may enter an apprenticeship .
Since the 1980s , Lutheran Church denominations have repudiated Martin Luther 's statements against the Jews and have rejected the use of them to incite hatred against Lutherans . Strommen et al . 's 1970 survey of 4,745 North American Lutherans aged 15–65 found that , compared to the other minority groups under consideration , Lutherans were the least prejudiced toward Jews . Nevertheless , Professor Richard ( Dick ) Geary , former Professor of Modern History at the University of Nottingham , England , and the author of Hitler and Nazism ( Routledge 1993 ) , wrote in the journal History Today an article on who voted for the Nazis in elections held from 1928-1933 , where he claimed that from his research he found that the Nazis gained disproportionately more votes from Protestant than Catholic areas of Germany .
In the summer of 1521 , Luther widened his target from individual pieties like indulgences and pilgrimages to doctrines at the heart of Church practices . In On the Abrogation of the Private Mass , he condemned as idolatry the idea that the mass is a sacrifice , asserting instead that it is a gift , to be received with thanksgiving by the whole congregation . His essay On Confession , Whether the Pope has the Power to Require It rejected compulsory confession and encouraged private confession and absolution , since " every Christian is a confessor . " In November , Luther wrote The Judgement of Martin Luther on Monastic Vows . He assured monks and nuns that they could break their vows without sin , because vows were an illegitimate and vain attempt to win salvation .
Hard rock developed into a major form of popular music in the 1970s , with bands such as Led Zeppelin , The Who , Deep Purple , Aerosmith , AC/DC and Van Halen . During the 1980s , some hard rock bands moved away from their hard rock roots and more towards pop rock , while others began to return to a hard rock sound . Established bands made a comeback in the mid-1980s and it reached a commercial peak in the 1980s , with glam metal bands like Bon Jovi and Def Leppard and the rawer sounds of Guns N ' Roses , which followed up with great success in the later part of that decade . Hard rock began losing popularity with the commercial success of grunge and later Britpop in the 1990s .
At the heart of scholars ' debate about Luther 's influence is whether it is anachronistic to view his work as a precursor of the racial antisemitism of the Nazis . Some scholars see Luther 's influence as limited , and the Nazis ' use of his work as opportunistic . Biographer Martin Brecht points out that " There is a world of difference between his belief in salvation and a racial ideology . Nevertheless , his misguided agitation had the evil result that Luther fatefully became one of the 'church fathers ' of anti-Semitism and thus provided material for the modern hatred of the Jews , cloaking it with the authority of the Reformer . " Johannes Wallmann argues that Luther 's writings against the Jews were largely ignored in the 18th and 19th centuries , and that there was no continuity between Luther 's thought and Nazi ideology . Uwe Siemon-Netto agreed , arguing that it was because the Nazis were already anti-Semites that they revived Luther 's work . Hans J. Hillerbrand agreed that to focus on Luther was to adopt an essentially ahistorical perspective of Nazi antisemitism that ignored other contributory factors in German history . Similarly , Roland Bainton , noted church historian and Luther biographer , wrote " One could wish that Luther had died before ever [ On the Jews and Their Lies ] was written . His position was entirely religious and in no respect racial . "

The structure of Bern 's city centre is largely medieval and has been recognised by UNESCO as a Cultural World Heritage Site . Perhaps its most famous sight is the Zytglogge ( Bernese German for " Time Bell " ) , an elaborate medieval clock tower with moving puppets . It also has an impressive 15th century Gothic cathedral , the Münster , and a 15th-century town hall . Thanks to 6 kilometres ( 4 miles ) of arcades , the old town boasts one of the longest covered shopping promenades in Europe .
The Marxist critique of capitalism — developed with Friedrich Engels — was , alongside liberalism and fascism , one of the defining ideological movements of the Twentieth Century . The industrial revolution produced a parallel revolution in political thought . Urbanization and capitalism greatly reshaped society . During this same period , the socialist movement began to form . In the mid-19th century , Marxism was developed , and socialism in general gained increasing popular support , mostly from the urban working class . Without breaking entirely from the past , Marx established principles that would be used by future revolutionaries of the 20th century namely Vladimir Lenin , Mao Zedong , Ho Chi Minh , and Fidel Castro . Though Hegel 's philosophy of history is similar to Immanuel Kant 's , and Karl Marx 's theory of revolution towards the common good is partly based on Kant 's view of history—Marx declared that he was turning Hegel 's dialectic , which was " standing on its head " , " the right side up again " . Unlike Marx who believed in historical materialism , Hegel believed in the Phenomenology of Spirit . By the late 19th century , socialism and trade unions were established members of the political landscape . In addition , the various branches of anarchism , with thinkers such as Mikhail Bakunin , Pierre-Joseph Proudhon or Peter Kropotkin , and syndicalism also gained some prominence . In the Anglo-American world , anti-imperialism and pluralism began gaining currency at the turn of the 20th century .
The city was originally built on a hilly peninsula surrounded by the River Aare , but outgrew natural boundaries by the 19th century . A number of bridges have been built to allow the city to expand beyond the Aare .
In South Africa , the period of colonization resulted in many unions and marriages between European men and African women from various tribes , resulting in mixed-race children . As the Europeans acquired territory and imposed rule over the Africans , they generally pushed mixed-race and Africans into second-class status . During the first half of the 20th century , the Afrikaaner-dominated government classified the population according to four main racial groups : Black , White , Asian ( mostly Indian ) , and Coloured . The Coloured group included people of mixed Bantu , Khoisan , and European descent ( with some Malay ancestry , especially in the Western Cape ) . The Coloured definition occupied an intermediary political position between the Black and White definitions in South Africa . It imposed a system of legal racial segregation , a complex of laws known as apartheid .
These styles generally have either two f-shaped soundholes like a violin ( F-5 and A-5 ) , or an oval sound hole ( F-4 and A-4 and lower models ) directly under the strings . Much variation exists between makers working from these archetypes , and other variants have become increasingly common . Generally , in the United States , Gibson F-hole F-5 mandolins and mandolins influenced by that design are strongly associated with bluegrass , while the A-style is associated other types of music , although it too is most often used for and associated with bluegrass . The F-5 's more complicated woodwork also translates into a more expensive instrument .
Football is the most popular national sport of Egypt . The Cairo Derby is one of the fiercest derbies in Africa , and the BBC picked it as one of the 7 toughest derbies in the world . Al Ahly is the most successful club of the 20th century in the African continent according to CAF , closely followed by their rivals Zamalek SC . Al Ahly was named in 2000 by the Confederation of African Football as the " African Club of the Century " . With twenty titles , Al Ahly is currently the world 's most successful club in terms of international trophies , surpassing Italy 's A.C. Milan and Argentina 's Boca Juniors , both having eighteen .

There is evidence of induced copper deficiency in those taking 100–300 mg of zinc daily . A 2007 trial observed that elderly men taking 80 mg daily were hospitalized for urinary complications more often than those taking a placebo . The USDA RDA is 11 and 8 mg Zn/day for men and women , respectively . Levels of 100–300 mg may interfere with the utilization of copper and iron or adversely affect cholesterol . Levels of zinc in excess of 500 ppm in soil interfere with the ability of plants to absorb other essential metals , such as iron and manganese . There is also a condition called the zinc shakes or " zinc chills " that can be induced by the inhalation of freshly formed zinc oxide formed during the welding of galvanized materials . Zinc is a common ingredient of denture cream which may contain between 17 and 38 mg of zinc per gram . There have been claims of disability , and even death , due to excessive use of these products .
However , this oft-quoted saying of Tetzel was by no means representative of contemporary Catholic teaching on indulgences , but rather a reflection of his capacity to exaggerate . Yet if Tetzel overstated the matter in regard to indulgences for the dead , his teaching on indulgences for the living was in line with Catholic dogma of the time .
Erik Erikson ( 1902-1994 ) became one of the earliest psychologists to take an explicit interest in identity . The Eriksonian framework rests upon a distinction among the psychological sense of continuity , known as the ego identity ( sometimes identified simply as " the self " ) ; the personal idiosyncrasies that separate one person from the next , known as the personal identity ; and the collection of social roles that a person might play , known as either the social identity or the cultural identity . Erikson 's work , in the psychodynamic tradition , aimed to investigate the process of identity formation across a lifespan . Progressive strength in the ego identity , for example , can be charted in terms of a series of stages in which identity is formed in response to increasingly sophisticated challenges . The process of forming a viable sense of identity for the culture is conceptualized as an adolescent task , and those who do not manage a resynthesis of childhood identifications are seen as being in a state of 'identity diffusion ' whereas those who retain their initially given identities unquestioned have 'foreclosed ' identities ( Weinreich & Saunderson 2003 p7-8 ) . On some readings of Erikson , the development of a strong ego identity , along with the proper integration into a stable society and culture , lead to a stronger sense of identity in general . Accordingly , a deficiency in either of these factors may increase the chance of an identity crisis or confusion ( Cote & Levine 2002 , p. 22 ) .
During Mubarak 's reign , the political scene was dominated by the National Democratic Party , which was created by Sadat in 1978 . It passed the 1993 Syndicates Law , 1995 Press Law , and 1999 Nongovernmental Associations Law which hampered freedoms of association and expression by imposing new regulations and draconian penalties on violations . [ citation needed ] As a result , by the late 1990s parliamentary politics had become virtually irrelevant and alternative avenues for political expression were curtailed as well .
In the first 200 years that black people were in the United States , they primarily identified themselves by their specific ethnic group ( closely allied to language ) and not by skin color . Individuals identified themselves , for example , as Ashanti , Igbo , Bakongo , or Wolof . However , when the first captives were brought to the Americas , they were often combined with other groups from West Africa , and individual ethnic affiliations were not generally acknowledged by English colonists . In areas of the Upper South , different ethnic groups were brought together . This is significant as the captives came from a vast geographic region : the West African coastline stretching from Senegal to Angola and in some cases from the south-east coast such as Mozambique . A new African-American identity and culture was born that incorporated elements of the various ethnic groups and of European cultural heritage , resulting in fusions such as the Black church and Black English . This new identity was based on provenance and slave status rather than membership in any one ethnic group . [ citation needed ] By contrast , slave records from Louisiana show that the French and Spanish colonists recorded more complete identities of the West Africans , including ethnicities and given tribal names .
Others have rejected that the doctrine of Immaculate Conception exists in Islam , the Quranic account does not confirm the Immaculate Conception exclusively for Mary as in Islam every human child is born pure and immaculate , her sinless birth is thus independent of the Christian docrtrine of original sin as no such doctrine exists in Islam . Moreover , Hannah 's prayer in the Quran for her child to remain protected from Satan ( Shayṭān ) was said after it had already been born , not before and expresses a natural concern any righteous parent would have . The Muslim tradition or hadith , which states that the only children born without the " touch of Satan , " were Mary and Jesus . should therefore not be taken in isolation from the Quran , and is to be interpreted within the specific context of exonerating Mary and her child from the charges that were made against them and is not a general statement . The specific mention of Mary and Jesus in this hadith may also be taken to represent a class of people , in keeping with the Arabic language and the Quranic verse [ O Satan ] surely thou shalt have no power over My servants , except such of the erring ones as choose to follow thee ( 15:42 )
Another family of bowlback mandolins came from Milan and Lombardy . These mandolins are closer to the mandolino or mandore than other modern mandolins . They are shorter and wider than the standard Neapolitan mandolin , with a shallow back . The instruments have 6 strings , 3 wire treble-strings and 3 gut or wire-wrapped-silk bass-strings . The strings ran between the tuning pegs and a bridge that was glued to the soundboard , as a guitar 's . The Lombardic mandolins were tuned g b e ' a ' d " g " . A developer of the Milanese stye was Antonio Monzino ( Milan ) and his family who made them for 6 generations .
Due to the Ottoman slave trade that had flourished in the Balkans , the coastal town of Ulcinj in Montenegro had its own black community . As a consequence of the slave trade and privateer activity , it is told how until 1878 in Ulcinj 100 black people lived . The Ottoman Army also deployed an estimated 30,000 Black African troops and cavalrymen to its expedition in Hungary during the Austro-Turkish War of 1716–18 .
Denver took the opening kickoff and started out strong with Peyton Manning completing an 18-yard pass to tight end Owen Daniels and a 22-yard throw to receiver Andre Caldwell . A pair of carries by C. J. Anderson moved the ball up 20 yards to the Panthers 14-yard line , but Carolina 's defense dug in over the next three plays . First , linebacker Shaq Thompson tackled Ronnie Hillman for a 3-yard loss . Then after an incompletion , Thomas Davis tackled Anderson for a 1-yard gain on third down , forcing Denver to settle for a 3–0 lead on a Brandon McManus 34-yard field goal . The score marked the first time in the entire postseason that Carolina was facing a deficit .
Some scholars have asserted that Luther taught that faith and reason were antithetical in the sense that questions of faith could not be illuminated by reason . He wrote , " All the articles of our Christian faith , which God has revealed to us in His Word , are in presence of reason sheerly impossible , absurd , and false . " and " [ That ] Reason in no way contributes to faith . [ ... ] For reason is the greatest enemy that faith has ; it never comes to the aid of spiritual things . " However , though seemingly contradictorily , he also wrote in the latter work that human reason " strives not against faith , when enlightened , but rather furthers and advances it " , bringing claims he was a fideist into dispute . Contemporary Lutheran scholarship , however , has found a different reality in Luther . Luther rather seeks to separate faith and reason in order to honor the separate spheres of knowledge that each applies to . Bernhard Lohse , for example , has demonstrated in his classic work " Fides und Ratio " that Luther ultimately sought to put the two together . More recently , Hans-Peter Grosshans has demonstrated that Luther 's work on Biblical Criticism stresses the need for external coherence in the right exegetical method . This means that for Luther it is more important that the Bible is reasonable according to the reality outside of the scriptures than that the Bible makes sense to itself , that it has internal coherence . The right tool for understanding the world outside of the Bible for Luther is none other than reason , which for him is the field of science , philosophy , history and empirical observation . Here a different picture is presented of a Luther who deeply valued both faith and reason , and held them in dialectical partnership . Luther 's concern thus in separating them is honoring their different epistemological spheres .
Zinc is included in most single tablet over-the-counter daily vitamin and mineral supplements . Preparations include zinc oxide , zinc acetate , and zinc gluconate . It is believed to possess antioxidant properties , which may protect against accelerated aging of the skin and muscles of the body ; studies differ as to its effectiveness . Zinc also helps speed up the healing process after an injury . It is also suspected of being beneficial to the body 's immune system . Indeed , zinc deficiency may have effects on virtually all parts of the human immune system .
The Neapolitan style has an almond-shaped body resembling a bowl , constructed from curved strips of wood . It usually has a bent sound table , canted in two planes with the design to take the tension of the 8 metal strings arranged in four courses . A hardwood fingerboard sits on top of or is flush with the sound table . Very old instruments may use wooden tuning pegs , while newer instruments tend to use geared metal tuners . The bridge is a movable length of hardwood . A pickguard is glued below the sound hole under the strings . European roundbacks commonly use a 13-inch scale instead of the 13.876 common on archtop Mandolins .
The second decline was not as complete as the first . Thousands of people had learned to play the instrument . Even as the second wave of mandolin popularity declined in the early 20th century , new versions of the mandolin began to be used in new forms of music . Luthiers created the resonator mandolin , the flatback mandolin , the carved-top or arched-top mandolin , the mandolin-banjo and the electric mandolin . Musicians began playing it in Celtic , Bluegrass , Jazz and Rock-n-Roll styles — and Classical too .
As African states became independent in the 1960s , the Soviet Union offered many of their citizens the chance to study in Russia . Over a period of 40 years , about 400,000 African students from various countries moved to Russia to pursue higher studies , including many Black Africans . This extended beyond the Soviet Union to many countries of the Eastern bloc .
The Sustainable Development Goals are ambitious , and they will require enormous efforts across countries , continents , industries and disciplines - but they are achievable . UNFPA is working with governments , partners and other UN agencies to directly tackle many of these goals - in particular Goal 3 on health , Goal 4 on education and Goal 5 on gender equality - and contributes in a variety of ways to achieving many of the rest .
On June 4 , 2014 , the NFL announced that the practice of branding Super Bowl games with Roman numerals , a practice established at Super Bowl V , would be temporarily suspended , and that the game would be named using Arabic numerals as Super Bowl 50 as opposed to Super Bowl L. The use of Roman numerals will be reinstated for Super Bowl LI . Jaime Weston , the league 's vice president of brand and creative , explained that a primary reason for the change was the difficulty of designing an aesthetically pleasing logo with the letter " L " using the standardized logo template introduced at Super Bowl XLV . The logo also deviates from the template by featuring large numerals , colored in gold , behind the Vince Lombardi Trophy , instead of underneath and in silver as in the standard logo .
The Panthers offense , which led the NFL in scoring ( 500 points ) , was loaded with talent , boasting six Pro Bowl selections . Pro Bowl quarterback Cam Newton had one of his best seasons , throwing for 3,837 yards and rushing for 636 , while recording a career-high and league-leading 45 total touchdowns ( 35 passing , 10 rushing ) , a career-low 10 interceptions , and a career-best quarterback rating of 99.4 . Newton 's leading receivers were tight end Greg Olsen , who caught a career-high 77 passes for 1,104 yards and seven touchdowns , and wide receiver Ted Ginn , Jr. , who caught 44 passes for 739 yards and 10 touchdowns ; Ginn also rushed for 60 yards and returned 27 punts for 277 yards . Other key receivers included veteran Jerricho Cotchery ( 39 receptions for 485 yards ) , rookie Devin Funchess ( 31 receptions for 473 yards and five touchdowns ) , and second-year receiver Corey Brown ( 31 receptions for 447 yards ) . The Panthers backfield featured Pro Bowl running back Jonathan Stewart , who led the team with 989 rushing yards and six touchdowns in 13 games , along with Pro Bowl fullback Mike Tolbert , who rushed for 256 yards and caught 18 passes for another 154 yards . Carolina 's offensive line also featured two Pro Bowl selections : center Ryan Kalil and guard Trai Turner .
Luther is honoured on 18 February with a commemoration in the Lutheran Calendar of Saints and in the Episcopal ( United States ) Calendar of Saints . In the Church of England 's Calendar of Saints he is commemorated on 31 October .
In honor of the 50th Super Bowl , the pregame ceremony featured the on-field introduction of 39 of the 43 previous Super Bowl Most Valuable Players . Bart Starr ( MVP of Super Bowls I and II ) and Chuck Howley ( MVP of Super Bowl V ) appeared via video , while Peyton Manning ( MVP of Super Bowl XLI and current Broncos quarterback ) was shown in the locker room preparing for the game . No plans were announced regarding the recognition of Harvey Martin , co-MVP of Super Bowl XII , who died in 2001 .
The Aeneid appears to have been a great success . Virgil is said to have recited Books 2 , 4 , and 6 to Augustus ; and Book 6 apparently caused Augustus ' sister Octavia to faint . Although the truth of this claim is subject to scholarly scepticism , it has served as a basis for later art , such as Jean-Baptiste Wicar 's Virgil Reading the Aeneid .
In 1975 , Sadat shifted Nasser 's economic policies and sought to use his popularity to reduce government regulations and encourage foreign investment through his program of Infitah . Through this policy , incentives such as reduced taxes and import tariffs attracted some investors , but investments were mainly directed at low risk and profitable ventures like tourism and construction , abandoning Egypt 's infant industries . Even though Sadat 's policy was intended to modernise Egypt and assist the middle class , it mainly benefited the higher class , and , because of the elimination of subsidies on basic foodstuffs , led to the 1977 Egyptian Bread Riots .
Martin Luther married Katharina von Bora , one of 12 nuns he had helped escape from the Nimbschen Cistercian convent in April 1523 , when he arranged for them to be smuggled out in herring barrels . " Suddenly , and while I was occupied with far different thoughts , " he wrote to Wenceslaus Link , " the Lord has plunged me into marriage . " At the time of their marriage , Katharina was 26 years old and Luther was 41 years old .
Luther dedicated himself to the Augustinian order , devoting himself to fasting , long hours in prayer , pilgrimage , and frequent confession . Luther described this period of his life as one of deep spiritual despair . He said , " I lost touch with Christ the Savior and Comforter , and made of him the jailer and hangman of my poor soul . " Johann von Staupitz , his superior , pointed Luther 's mind away from continual reflection upon his sins toward the merits of Christ . He taught that true repentance does not involve self-inflicted penances and punishments but rather a change of heart .
By the end of the decade a distinct genre of hard rock was emerging with bands like Led Zeppelin , who mixed the music of early rock bands with a more hard-edged form of blues rock and acid rock on their first two albums Led Zeppelin ( 1969 ) and Led Zeppelin II ( 1969 ) , and Deep Purple , who began as a progressive rock group but achieved their commercial breakthrough with their fourth and distinctively heavier album , In Rock ( 1970 ) . Also significant was Black Sabbath 's Paranoid ( 1970 ) , which combined guitar riffs with dissonance and more explicit references to the occult and elements of Gothic horror . All three of these bands have been seen as pivotal in the development of heavy metal , but where metal further accentuated the intensity of the music , with bands like Judas Priest following Sabbath 's lead into territory that was often " darker and more menacing " , hard rock tended to continue to remain the more exuberant , good-time music .
In the Ottoman Empire , these ideological reforms did not take place and these views did not integrate into common thought until much later . As well , there was no spread of this doctrine within the New World and the advanced civilizations of the Aztec , Maya , Inca , Mohican , Delaware , Huron and especially the Iroquois . The Iroquois philosophy in particular gave much to Christian thought of the time and in many cases actually inspired some of the institutions adopted in the United States : for example , Benjamin Franklin was a great admirer of some of the methods of the Iroquois Confederacy , and much of early American literature emphasized the political philosophy of the natives .
Being identified as either " black " or " white " in Australia during the 19th and early 20th centuries was critical in one 's employment and social prospects . Various state-based Aboriginal Protection Boards were established which had virtually complete control over the lives of Indigenous Australians – where they lived , their employment , marriage , education and included the power to separate children from their parents . Aborigines were not allowed to vote and were often confined to reserves and forced into low paid or effectively slave labour . The social position of mixed-race or " half-caste " individuals varied over time . A 1913 report by Sir Baldwin Spencer states that :
The Panthers seemed primed to score on their opening drive of the second half when Newton completed a 45-yard pass to Ted Ginn Jr. on the Denver 35-yard line on their second offensive play . But the Broncos defense halted the drive on the 26-yard line , and it ended with no points when Graham Gano hit the uprights on a 44-yard field goal attempt . After the miss , Manning completed a pair of passes to Emmanuel Sanders for gains of 25 and 22 yards , setting up McManus ' 33-yard field goal that gave the Broncos a 16–7 lead . Carolina got off to another strong start after the kickoff , with Newton completing a 42-yard pass to Corey Brown . But once again they came up empty , this time as a result of a Newton pass that bounced off the hands of Ginn and was intercepted by safety T. J . Ward . Ward fumbled the ball during the return , but Trevathan recovered it to enable Denver to keep possession .
The element was probably named by the alchemist Paracelsus after the German word Zinke ( prong , tooth ) . German chemist Andreas Sigismund Marggraf is credited with discovering pure metallic zinc in 1746 . Work by Luigi Galvani and Alessandro Volta uncovered the electrochemical properties of zinc by 1800 . Corrosion-resistant zinc plating of iron ( hot-dip galvanizing ) is the major application for zinc . Other applications are in batteries , small non-structural castings , and alloys , such as brass . A variety of zinc compounds are commonly used , such as zinc carbonate and zinc gluconate ( as dietary supplements ) , zinc chloride ( in deodorants ) , zinc pyrithione ( anti-dandruff shampoos ) , zinc sulfide ( in luminescent paints ) , and zinc methyl or zinc diethyl in the organic laboratory .
Different societies apply differing criteria regarding who is classified as " black " , and these social constructs have also changed over time . In a number of countries , societal variables affect classification as much as skin color , and the social criteria for " blackness " vary . For example , in North America the term black people is not necessarily an indicator of skin color or majority ethnic ancestry , but it is instead a socially based racial classification related to being African American , with a family history associated with institutionalized slavery . In South Africa and Latin America , for instance , mixed-race people are generally not classified as " black . " In South Pacific regions such as Australia and Melanesia , European colonists applied the term " black " or it was used by populations with different histories and ethnic origin .

The mandolin 's popularity in the United States was spurred by the success of a group of touring young European musicians known as the Estudiantina Figaro , or in the United States , simply the " Spanish Students . " The group landed in the U.S. on January 2 , 1880 in New York City , and played in Boston and New York to wildly enthusiastic crowds . Ironically , this ensemble did not play mandolins but rather bandurrias , which are also small , double-strung instruments that resemble the mandolin . The success of the Figaro Spanish Students spawned other groups who imitated their musical style and costumes . An Italian musician , Carlo Curti , hastily started a musical ensemble after seeing the Figaro Spanish Students perform ; his group of Italian born Americans called themselves the " Original Spanish Students , " counting on the American public to not know the difference between the Spanish bandurrias and Italian mandolins . The imitators ' use of mandolins helped to generate enormous public interest in an instrument previously relatively unknown in the United States .
On 13 June 1525 , the couple was engaged with Johannes Bugenhagen , Justus Jonas , Johannes Apel , Philipp Melanchthon and Lucas Cranach the Elder and his wife as witnesses . On the evening of the same day , the couple was married by Bugenhagen . The ceremonial walk to the church and the wedding banquet were left out , and were made up two weeks later on 27 June .
There would be no more scoring in the third quarter , but early in the fourth , the Broncos drove to the Panthers 41-yard line . On the next play , Ealy knocked the ball out of Manning 's hand as he was winding up for a pass , and then recovered it for Carolina on the 50-yard line . A 16-yard reception by Devin Funchess and a 12-yard run by Stewart then set up Gano 's 39-yard field goal , cutting the Panthers deficit to one score at 16–10 . The next three drives of the game would end in punts .
There are many important organozinc compounds . Organozinc chemistry is the science of organozinc compounds describing their physical properties , synthesis and reactions . Among important applications is the Frankland-Duppa Reaction in which an oxalate ester ( ROCOCOOR ) reacts with an alkyl halide R'X , zinc and hydrochloric acid to the α-hydroxycarboxylic esters RR'COHCOOR , the Reformatskii reaction which converts α-halo-esters and aldehydes to β-hydroxy-esters , the Simmons–Smith reaction in which the carbenoid ( iodomethyl ) zinc iodide reacts with alkene ( or alkyne ) and converts them to cyclopropane , the Addition reaction of organozinc compounds to carbonyl compounds . The Barbier reaction ( 1899 ) is the zinc equivalent of the magnesium Grignard reaction and is better of the two . In presence of just about any water the formation of the organomagnesium halide will fail , whereas the Barbier reaction can even take place in water . On the downside organozincs are much less nucleophilic than Grignards , are expensive and difficult to handle . Commercially available diorganozinc compounds are dimethylzinc , diethylzinc and diphenylzinc . In one study the active organozinc compound is obtained from much cheaper organobromine precursors :
Super Bowl 50 featured numerous records from individuals and teams . Denver won despite being massively outgained in total yards ( 315 to 194 ) and first downs ( 21 to 11 ) . Their 194 yards and 11 first downs were both the lowest totals ever by a Super Bowl winning team . The previous record was 244 yards by the Baltimore Ravens in Super Bowl XXXV . Only seven other teams had ever gained less than 200 yards in a Super Bowl , and all of them had lost . The Broncos ' seven sacks tied a Super Bowl record set by the Chicago Bears in Super Bowl XX . Kony Ealy tied a Super Bowl record with three sacks . Jordan Norwood 's 61-yard punt return set a new record , surpassing the old record of 45 yards set by John Taylor in Super Bowl XXIII . Denver was just 1-of-14 on third down , while Carolina was barely better at 3-of-15 . The two teams ' combined third down conversion percentage of 13.8 was a Super Bowl low . Manning and Newton had quarterback passer ratings of 56.6 and 55.4 , respectively , and their added total of 112 is a record lowest aggregate passer rating for a Super Bowl . Manning became the oldest quarterback ever to win a Super Bowl at age 39 , and the first quarterback ever to win a Super Bowl with two different teams , while Gary Kubiak became the first head coach to win a Super Bowl with the same franchise he went to the Super Bowl with as a player .
Luther 's 1538 hymnic version of the Lord 's Prayer , " Vater unser im Himmelreich " , corresponds exactly to Luther 's explanation of the prayer in the Small Catechism , with one stanza for each of the seven prayer petitions , plus opening and closing stanzas . The hymn functioned both as a liturgical setting of the Lord 's Prayer and as a means of examining candidates on specific catechism questions . The extant manuscript shows multiple revisions , demonstrating Luther 's concern to clarify and strengthen the text and to provide an appropriately prayerful tune . Other 16th- and 20th-century versifications of the Lord 's Prayer have adopted Luther 's tune , although modern texts are considerably shorter .
During the 2009–10 school year , there were a total of 10,979 pupils attending classes in Bern . There were 89 kindergarten classes with a total of 1,641 pupils in the municipality . Of the kindergarten pupils , 32.4 % were permanent or temporary residents of Switzerland ( not citizens ) and 40.2 % have a different mother language than the classroom language . The municipality had 266 primary classes and 5,040 pupils . Of the primary pupils , 30.1 % were permanent or temporary residents of Switzerland ( not citizens ) and 35.7 % have a different mother language than the classroom language . During the same year , there were 151 lower secondary classes with a total of 2,581 pupils . There were 28.7 % who were permanent or temporary residents of Switzerland ( not citizens ) and 32.7 % have a different mother language than the classroom language .
Egyptian music is a rich mixture of indigenous , Mediterranean , African and Western elements . It has been an integral part of Egyptian culture since antiquity . The ancient Egyptians credited one of their gods Hathor with the invention of music , which Osiris in turn used as part of his effort to civilise the world . Egyptians used music instruments since then . Contemporary Egyptian music traces its beginnings to the creative work of people such as Abdu El Hamouli , Almaz and Mahmoud Osman , who influenced the later work of Sayed Darwish , Umm Kulthum , Mohammed Abdel Wahab and Abdel Halim Hafez whose age is considered the golden age of music in Egypt and the whole Middle East and North-Africa . Prominent contemporary Egyptian pop singers include Amr Diab and Mohamed Mounir .
By 1526 , Luther found himself increasingly occupied in organising a new church . His Biblical ideal of congregations ' choosing their own ministers had proved unworkable . According to Bainton : " Luther 's dilemma was that he wanted both a confessional church based on personal faith and experience and a territorial church including all in a given locality . If he were forced to choose , he would take his stand with the masses , and this was the direction in which he moved . " From 1525 to 1529 , he established a supervisory church body , laid down a new form of worship service , and wrote a clear summary of the new faith in the form of two catechisms . Luther 's thought is revolutionary to the extent that it is a theology of the cross , the negation of every affirmation : as long as the cross is at the center , the system building tendency of reason is held in check , and system building does not degenerate into System .
The mandolin has been used occasionally in rock music , first appearing in the psychedelic era of the late 1960s . Levon Helm of The Band occasionally moved from his drum kit to play mandolin , most notably on Rag Mama Rag , Rockin ' Chair , and Evangeline . Ian Anderson of Jethro Tull played mandolin on Fat Man , from their second album , Stand Up , and also occasionally on later releases . Rod Stewart 's 1971 No . 1 hit Maggie May features a significant mandolin riff . David Grisman played mandolin on two Grateful Dead songs on the American Beauty album , Friend of the Devil and Ripple , which became instant favorites among amateur pickers at jam sessions and campground gatherings . John Paul Jones and Jimmy Page both played mandolin on Led Zeppelin songs . The popular alt rock group Imagine Dragons feature the mandolin on a few of their songs , most prominently being It 's Time . Dash Crofts of the soft rock duo Seals and Crofts extensively used mandolin in their repertoire during the 1970s . Styx released the song Boat on the River in 1980 , which featured Tommy Shaw on vocals and mandolin . The song did n't chart in the United States but was popular in much of Europe and the Philippines .
Contemporaneously with the rise of analytic ethics in Anglo-American thought , in Europe several new lines of philosophy directed at critique of existing societies arose between the 1950s and 1980s . Most of these took elements of Marxist economic analysis , but combined them with a more cultural or ideological emphasis . Out of the Frankfurt School , thinkers like Herbert Marcuse , Theodor W. Adorno , Max Horkheimer , and Jürgen Habermas combined Marxian and Freudian perspectives . Along somewhat different lines , a number of other continental thinkers—still largely influenced by Marxism—put new emphases on structuralism and on a " return to Hegel " . Within the ( post- ) structuralist line ( though mostly not taking that label ) are thinkers such as Gilles Deleuze , Michel Foucault , Claude Lefort , and Jean Baudrillard . The Situationists were more influenced by Hegel ; Guy Debord , in particular , moved a Marxist analysis of commodity fetishism to the realm of consumption , and looked at the relation between consumerism and dominant ideology formation .
The etymology of the name Bern is uncertain . According to the local legend , based on folk etymology , Berchtold V , Duke of Zähringen , the founder of the city of Bern , vowed to name the city after the first animal he met on the hunt , and this turned out to be a bear . It has long been considered likely that the city was named after the Italian city of Verona , which at the time was known as Bern in Middle High German . As a result of the find of the Bern zinc tablet in the 1980s , it is now more common to assume that the city was named after a pre-existing toponym of Celtic origin , possibly *berna " cleft " . The bear was the heraldic animal of the seal and coat of arms of Bern from at least the 1220s . The earliest reference to the keeping of live bears in the Bärengraben dates to the 1440s .
Egypt has one of the longest histories of any modern country , arising in the tenth millennium BC as one of the world 's first nation states . Considered a cradle of civilisation , Ancient Egypt experienced some of the earliest developments of writing , agriculture , urbanisation , organised religion and central government . Iconic monuments such as the Giza Necropolis and its Great Sphinx , as well the ruins of Memphis , Thebes , Karnak , and the Valley of the Kings , reflect this legacy and remain a significant focus of archaeological study and popular interest worldwide . Egypt 's rich cultural heritage is an integral part of its national identity , having endured , and at times assimilated , various foreign influences , including Greek , Persian , Roman , Arab , Ottoman , and European . Although Christianised in the first century of the Common Era , it was subsequently Islamised due to the Islamic conquests of the seventh century .
The United Nations Population Fund ( UNFPA ) , formerly the United Nations Fund for Population Activities , is a UN organization . The UNFPA says it " is the lead UN agency for delivering a world where every pregnancy is wanted , every childbirth is safe and every young person 's potential is fulfilled . " Their work involves the improvement of reproductive health ; including creation of national strategies and protocols , and providing supplies and services . The organization has recently been known for its worldwide campaign against obstetric fistula and female genital mutilation .
CBS set the base rate for a 30-second advertisement at $ 5,000,000 , a record high price for a Super Bowl ad . As of January 26 , the advertisements had not yet sold out . CBS mandated that all advertisers purchase a package covering time on both the television and digital broadcasts of the game , meaning that for the first time , digital streams of the game would carry all national advertising in pattern with the television broadcast . This would be the final year in a multi-year contract with Anheuser-Busch InBev that allowed the beer manufacturer to air multiple advertisements during the game at a steep discount . It was also the final year that Doritos , a longtime sponsor of the game , held its " Crash the Super Bowl " contest that allowed viewers to create their own Doritos ads for a chance to have it aired during the game . Nintendo and The Pokémon Company also made their Super Bowl debut , promoting the 20th anniversary of the Pokémon video game and media franchise .
The tradition holds that Virgil was born in the village of Andes , near Mantua in Cisalpine Gaul . Analysis of his name has led to beliefs that he descended from earlier Roman colonists . Modern speculation ultimately is not supported by narrative evidence either from his own writings or his later biographers . Macrobius says that Virgil 's father was of a humble background ; however , scholars generally believe that Virgil was from an equestrian landowning family which could afford to give him an education . He attended schools in Cremona , Mediolanum , Rome and Naples . After considering briefly a career in rhetoric and law , the young Virgil turned his talents to poetry .
Luther 's hymns were included in early Lutheran hymnals and spread the ideas of the Reformation . He supplied four of eight songs of the First Lutheran hymnal Achtliederbuch , 18 of 26 songs of the Erfurt Enchiridion , and 24 of the 32 songs in the first choral hymnal with settings by Johann Walter , Eyn geystlich Gesangk Buchleyn , all published in 1524 .
The second half of the 20th century to the present has seen a gradual shift towards improved human rights for Aboriginal people . In a 1967 referendum over 90 % of the Australian population voted to end constitutional discrimination and to include Aborigines in the national census . During this period many Aboriginal activists began to embrace the term " black " and use their ancestry as a source of pride . Activist Bob Maza said :
The game 's media day , which was typically held on the Tuesday afternoon prior to the game , was moved to the Monday evening and re-branded as Super Bowl Opening Night . The event was held on February 1 , 2016 at SAP Center in San Jose . Alongside the traditional media availabilities , the event featured an opening ceremony with player introductions on a replica of the Golden Gate Bridge .
His last sermon was delivered at Eisleben , his place of birth , on 15 February 1546 , three days before his death . It was " entirely devoted to the obdurate Jews , whom it was a matter of great urgency to expel from all German territory , " according to Léon Poliakov . James Mackinnon writes that it concluded with a " fiery summons to drive the Jews bag and baggage from their midst , unless they desisted from their calumny and their usury and became Christians . " Luther said , " we want to practice Christian love toward them and pray that they convert , " but also that they are " our public enemies ... and if they could kill us all , they would gladly do so . And so often they do . "
The Aeneid is widely considered Virgil 's finest work and one of the most important poems in the history of western literature . Virgil worked on the Aeneid during the last eleven years of his life ( 29–19 BC ) , commissioned , according to Propertius , by Augustus . The epic poem consists of 12 books in dactylic hexameter verse which describe the journey of Aeneas , a warrior fleeing the sack of Troy , to Italy , his battle with the Italian prince Turnus , and the foundation of a city from which Rome would emerge . The Aeneid 's first six books describe the journey of Aeneas from Troy to Rome . Virgil made use of several models in the composition of his epic ; Homer , the preeminent author of classical epic , is everywhere present , but Virgil also makes special use of the Latin poet Ennius and the Hellenistic poet Apollonius of Rhodes among the various other writers to which he alludes . Although the Aeneid casts itself firmly into the epic mode , it often seeks to expand the genre by including elements of other genres such as tragedy and aetiological poetry . Ancient commentators noted that Virgil seems to divide the Aeneid into two sections based on the poetry of Homer ; the first six books were viewed as employing the Odyssey as a model while the last six were connected to the Iliad .
The report " Mary : Faith and Hope in Christ " , by the Anglican-Roman Catholic International Commission , concluded that the teaching about Mary in the two definitions of the Assumption and the Immaculate Conception can be said to be consonant with the teaching of the Scriptures and the ancient common traditions . But the report expressed concerns that the Roman Catholic dogmatic definitions of these concepts implies them to be " revealed by God " , stating : " The question arises for Anglicans , however , as to whether these doctrines concerning Mary are revealed by God in a way which must be held by believers as a matter of faith . "
In cities other than Rome , the name cardinal began to be applied to certain church men as a mark of honour . The earliest example of this occurs in a letter sent by Pope Zacharias in 747 to Pippin III ( the Short ) , ruler of the Franks , in which Zacharias applied the title to the priests of Paris to distinguish them from country clergy . This meaning of the word spread rapidly , and from the 9th century various episcopal cities had a special class among the clergy known as cardinals . The use of the title was reserved for the cardinals of Rome in 1567 by Pius V .
The City Parliament ( de : Stadtrat , fr : Conseil de ville ) holds legislative power . It is made up of 80 members , with elections held every four years . The City Parliament decrees regulations and by-laws that are executed by the City Council and the administration . The delegates are selected by means of a system of proportional representation .

Luther spoke out against the Jews in Saxony , Brandenburg , and Silesia . Josel of Rosheim , the Jewish spokesman who tried to help the Jews of Saxony in 1537 , later blamed their plight on " that priest whose name was Martin Luther—may his body and soul be bound up in hell ! —who wrote and issued many heretical books in which he said that whoever would help the Jews was doomed to perdition . " Josel asked the city of Strasbourg to forbid the sale of Luther 's anti-Jewish works : they refused initially , but did so when a Lutheran pastor in Hochfelden used a sermon to urge his parishioners to murder Jews . Luther 's influence persisted after his death . Throughout the 1580s , riots led to the expulsion of Jews from several German Lutheran states .
The doctrine of the immaculate conception ( Mary being conceived free from original sin ) is not to be confused with her virginal conception of her son Jesus . This misunderstanding of the term immaculate conception is frequently met in the mass media . Catholics believe that Mary was not the product of a virginal conception herself but was the daughter of a human father and mother , traditionally known by the names of Saint Joachim and Saint Anne . In 1677 , the Holy See condemned the belief that Mary was virginally conceived , which had been a belief surfacing occasionally since the 4th century . The Church celebrates the Feast of the Immaculate Conception ( when Mary was conceived free from original sin ) on 8 December , exactly nine months before celebrating the Nativity of Mary . The feast of the Annunciation ( which commemorates the virginal conception and the Incarnation of Jesus ) is celebrated on 25 March , nine months before Christmas Day .
These different explorations of 'identity ' demonstrate how difficult a concept it is to pin down . Since identity is a virtual thing , it is impossible to define it empirically . Discussions of identity use the term with different meanings , from fundamental and abiding sameness , to fluidity , contingency , negotiated and so on . Brubaker and Cooper note a tendency in many scholars to confuse identity as a category of practice and as a category of analysis ( Brubaker & Cooper 2000 , p. 5 ) . Indeed , many scholars demonstrate a tendency to follow their own preconceptions of identity , following more or less the frameworks listed above , rather than taking into account the mechanisms by which the concept is crystallised as reality . In this environment , some analysts , such as Brubaker and Cooper , have suggested doing away with the concept completely ( Brubaker & Cooper 2000 , p. 1 ) . Others , by contrast , have sought to introduce alternative concepts in an attempt to capture the dynamic and fluid qualities of human social self-expression . Hall ( 1992 , 1996 ) , for example , suggests treating identity as a process , to take into account the reality of diverse and ever-changing social experience . Some scholars have introduced the idea of identification , whereby identity is perceived as made up of different components that are 'identified ' and interpreted by individuals . The construction of an individual sense of self is achieved by personal choices regarding who and what to associate with . Such approaches are liberating in their recognition of the role of the individual in social interaction and the construction of identity .
Luther 's 1524 creedal hymn " Wir glauben all an einen Gott " ( " We All Believe in One True God " ) is a three-stanza confession of faith prefiguring Luther 's 1529 three-part explanation of the Apostles ' Creed in the Small Catechism . Luther 's hymn , adapted and expanded from an earlier German creedal hymn , gained widespread use in vernacular Lutheran liturgies as early as 1525 . Sixteenth-century Lutheran hymnals also included " Wir glauben all " among the catechetical hymns , although 18th-century hymnals tended to label the hymn as Trinitarian rather than catechetical , and 20th-century Lutherans rarely use the hymn because of the perceived difficulty of its tune .
In response to demands for a German liturgy , Luther wrote a German Mass , which he published in early 1526 . He did not intend it as a replacement for his 1523 adaptation of the Latin Mass but as an alternative for the " simple people " , a " public stimulation for people to believe and become Christians . " Luther based his order on the Catholic service but omitted " everything that smacks of sacrifice " ; and the Mass became a celebration where everyone received the wine as well as the bread . He retained the elevation of the host and chalice , while trappings such as the Mass vestments , altar , and candles were made optional , allowing freedom of ceremony . Some reformers , including followers of Huldrych Zwingli , considered Luther 's service too papistic ; and modern scholars note the conservatism of his alternative to the Catholic mass . Luther 's service , however , included congregational singing of hymns and psalms in German , as well as of parts of the liturgy , including Luther 's unison setting of the Creed . To reach the simple people and the young , Luther incorporated religious instruction into the weekday services in the form of the catechism . He also provided simplified versions of the baptism and marriage services .
Denver took the opening kickoff and started out strong with Peyton Manning completing an 18-yard pass to tight end Owen Daniels and a 22-yard throw to receiver Andre Caldwell . A pair of carries by C. J. Anderson moved the ball up 20 yards to the Panthers 14-yard line , but Carolina 's defense dug in over the next three plays . First , linebacker Shaq Thompson tackled Ronnie Hillman for a 3-yard loss . Then after an incompletion , Thomas Davis tackled Anderson for a 1-yard gain on third down , forcing Denver to settle for a 3–0 lead on a Brandon McManus 34-yard field goal . The score marked the first time in the entire postseason that Carolina was facing a deficit .

By the end of the decade a distinct genre of hard rock was emerging with bands like Led Zeppelin , who mixed the music of early rock bands with a more hard-edged form of blues rock and acid rock on their first two albums Led Zeppelin ( 1969 ) and Led Zeppelin II ( 1969 ) , and Deep Purple , who began as a progressive rock group but achieved their commercial breakthrough with their fourth and distinctively heavier album , In Rock ( 1970 ) . Also significant was Black Sabbath 's Paranoid ( 1970 ) , which combined guitar riffs with dissonance and more explicit references to the occult and elements of Gothic horror . All three of these bands have been seen as pivotal in the development of heavy metal , but where metal further accentuated the intensity of the music , with bands like Judas Priest following Sabbath 's lead into territory that was often " darker and more menacing " , hard rock tended to continue to remain the more exuberant , good-time music .
Published at a time of rising demand for German-language publications , Luther 's version quickly became a popular and influential Bible translation . As such , it made a significant contribution to the evolution of the German language and literature . Furnished with notes and prefaces by Luther , and with woodcuts by Lucas Cranach that contained anti-papal imagery , it played a major role in the spread of Luther 's doctrine throughout Germany . The Luther Bible influenced other vernacular translations , such as William Tyndale 's English Bible ( 1525 forward ) , a precursor of the King James Bible .

The legend of Virgil in his Basket arose in the Middle Ages , and is often seen in art and mentioned in literature as part of the Power of Women literary topos , demonstrating the disruptive force of female attractiveness on men . In this story Virgil became enamoured of a beautiful woman , sometimes described as the emperor 's daughter or mistress and called Lucretia . She played him along and agreed to an assignation at her house , which he was to sneak into at night by climbing into a large basket let down from a window . When he did so he was only hoisted halfway up the wall and then left him trapped there into the next day , exposed to public ridicule . The story paralleled that of Phyllis riding Aristotle . Among other artists depicting the scene , Lucas van Leyden made a woodcut and later an engraving .
The term " Moors " has been used in Europe in a broader , somewhat derogatory sense to refer to Muslims , especially those of Arab or Berber descent , whether living in North Africa or Iberia . Moors were not a distinct or self-defined people . Medieval and early modern Europeans applied the name to Muslim Arabs , Berbers , Black Africans and Europeans alike .
Kenneth Gergen formulated additional classifications , which include the strategic manipulator , the pastiche personality , and the relational self . The strategic manipulator is a person who begins to regard all senses of identity merely as role-playing exercises , and who gradually becomes alienated from his or her social " self " . The pastiche personality abandons all aspirations toward a true or " essential " identity , instead viewing social interactions as opportunities to play out , and hence become , the roles they play . Finally , the relational self is a perspective by which persons abandon all sense of exclusive self , and view all sense of identity in terms of social engagement with others . For Gergen , these strategies follow one another in phases , and they are linked to the increase in popularity of postmodern culture and the rise of telecommunications technology .
Sometime after the publication of the Eclogues ( probably before 37 BC ) , Virgil became part of the circle of Maecenas , Octavian 's capable agent d'affaires who sought to counter sympathy for Antony among the leading families by rallying Roman literary figures to Octavian 's side . Virgil came to know many of the other leading literary figures of the time , including Horace , in whose poetry he is often mentioned , and Varius Rufus , who later helped finish the Aeneid .
Book 7 ( beginning the Iliadic half ) opens with an address to the muse and recounts Aeneas ' arrival in Italy and betrothal to Lavinia , daughter of King Latinus . Lavinia had already been promised to Turnus , the king of the Rutulians , who is roused to war by the Fury Allecto , and Amata Lavinia 's mother . In Book 8 , Aeneas allies with King Evander , who occupies the future site of Rome , and is given new armor and a shield depicting Roman history . Book 9 records an assault by Nisus and Euryalus on the Rutulians , Book 10 , the death of Evander 's young son Pallas , and 11 the death of the Volscian warrior princess Camilla and the decision to settle the war with a duel between Aeneas and Turnus . The Aeneid ends in Book 12 with the taking of Latinus ' city , the death of Amata , and Aeneas ' defeat and killing of Turnus , whose pleas for mercy are spurned . The final book ends with the image of Turnus ' soul lamenting as it flees to the underworld .
Luther dedicated himself to the Augustinian order , devoting himself to fasting , long hours in prayer , pilgrimage , and frequent confession . Luther described this period of his life as one of deep spiritual despair . He said , " I lost touch with Christ the Savior and Comforter , and made of him the jailer and hangman of my poor soul . " Johann von Staupitz , his superior , pointed Luther 's mind away from continual reflection upon his sins toward the merits of Christ . He taught that true repentance does not involve self-inflicted penances and punishments but rather a change of heart .
By about 6000 BC , a Neolithic culture rooted in the Nile Valley . During the Neolithic era , several predynastic cultures developed independently in Upper and Lower Egypt . The Badarian culture and the successor Naqada series are generally regarded as precursors to dynastic Egypt . The earliest known Lower Egyptian site , Merimda , predates the Badarian by about seven hundred years . Contemporaneous Lower Egyptian communities coexisted with their southern counterparts for more than two thousand years , remaining culturally distinct , but maintaining frequent contact through trade . The earliest known evidence of Egyptian hieroglyphic inscriptions appeared during the predynastic period on Naqada III pottery vessels , dated to about 3200 BC .
BSkyB launched its HDTV service , Sky+ HD , on 22 May 2006 . Prior to its launch , BSkyB claimed that 40,000 people had registered to receive the HD service . In the week before the launch , rumours started to surface that BSkyB was having supply issues with its set top box ( STB ) from manufacturer Thomson . On Thursday 18 May 2006 , and continuing through the weekend before launch , people were reporting that BSkyB had either cancelled or rescheduled its installation . Finally , the BBC reported that 17,000 customers had yet to receive the service due to failed deliveries . On 31 March 2012 , Sky announced the total number of homes with Sky+HD was 4,222,000 .
In the early 20th century several mandolin orchestras ( Estudiantinas ) were active in Belgium . Today only a few groups remain : Royal Estudiantina la Napolitaine ( founded in 1904 ) in Antwerp , Brasschaats mandoline orkest in Brasschaat and an orchestra in Mons ( Bergen ) . Gerda Abts is a well known mandolin virtuoso in Belgium . She is also mandolin teacher and gives lessons in the music academies of Lier , Wijnegem and Brasschaat . She is now also professor mandolin at the music high school “ Koninklijk Conservatorium Artesis Hogeschool Antwerpen ” . She also gives various concerts each year in different ensembles . She is in close contact to the Brasschaat mandolin Orchestra . Her site is www.gevoeligesnaar.be
Others have rejected that the doctrine of Immaculate Conception exists in Islam , the Quranic account does not confirm the Immaculate Conception exclusively for Mary as in Islam every human child is born pure and immaculate , her sinless birth is thus independent of the Christian docrtrine of original sin as no such doctrine exists in Islam . Moreover , Hannah 's prayer in the Quran for her child to remain protected from Satan ( Shayṭān ) was said after it had already been born , not before and expresses a natural concern any righteous parent would have . The Muslim tradition or hadith , which states that the only children born without the " touch of Satan , " were Mary and Jesus . should therefore not be taken in isolation from the Quran , and is to be interpreted within the specific context of exonerating Mary and her child from the charges that were made against them and is not a general statement . The specific mention of Mary and Jesus in this hadith may also be taken to represent a class of people , in keeping with the Arabic language and the Quranic verse [ O Satan ] surely thou shalt have no power over My servants , except such of the erring ones as choose to follow thee ( 15:42 )
The mandolin orchestras never completely went away , however . In fact , along with all the other musical forms the mandolin is involved with , the mandolin ensemble ( groups usually arranged like the string section of a modern symphony orchestra , with first mandolins , second mandolins , mandolas , mandocellos , mando-basses , and guitars , and sometimes supplemented by other instruments ) continues to grow in popularity . Since the mid-nineties , several public-school mandolin-based guitar programs have blossomed around the country , including Fretworks Mandolin and Guitar Orchestra , the first of its kind . The national organization , Classical Mandolin Society of America , founded by Norman Levine , represents these groups . Prominent modern mandolinists and composers for mandolin in the classical music tradition include Samuel Firstman , Howard Fry , Rudy Cipolla , Dave Apollon , Neil Gladd , Evan Marshall , Marilynn Mair and Mark Davis ( the Mair-Davis Duo ) , Brian Israel , David Evans , Emanuil Shynkman , Radim Zenkl , David Del Tredici and Ernst Krenek .
Jethro Burns , best known as half of the comedy duo Homer and Jethro , was also the first important jazz mandolinist . Tiny Moore popularized the mandolin in Western swing music . He initially played an 8-string Gibson but switched after 1952 to a 5-string solidbody electric instrument built by Paul Bigsby . Modern players David Grisman , Sam Bush , and Mike Marshall , among others , have worked since the early 1970s to demonstrate the mandolin 's versatility for all styles of music . Chris Thile of California is a well-known player , and has accomplished many feats of traditional bluegrass , classical , contemporary pop and rock ; the band Nickel Creek featured his playing in its blend of traditional and pop styles , and he now plays in his band Punch Brothers . Most commonly associated with bluegrass , mandolin has been used a lot in country music over the years . Some well-known players include Marty Stuart , Vince Gill , and Ricky Skaggs .
Although the doctrine of Mary 's Immaculate Conception appears only later among Latin ( and particularly Frankish ) theologians , it became ever more manifest among Byzantine theologians reliant on Gregory Nazianzen 's Mariology in the Medieval or Byzantine East . Although hymnographers and scholars , like the Emperor Justinian I , were accustomed to call Mary " prepurified " in their poetic and credal statements , the first point of departure for more fully commenting on Nazianzen 's meaning occurs in Sophronius of Jerusalem . In other places Sophronius explains that the Theotokos was already immaculate , when she was " purified " at the Annunciation and goes so far as to note that John the Baptist is literally " holier than all 'Men ' born of woman " since Mary 's surpassing holiness signifies that she was holier than even John after his sanctification in utero . Sophronius ' teaching is augmented and incorporated by St. John Damascene ( d. 749/750 ) . John , besides many passages wherein he extolls the Theotokos for her purification at the Annunciation , grants her the unique honor of " purifying the waters of baptism by touching them . " This honor was most famously and firstly attributed to Christ , especially in the legacy of Nazianzen . As such , Nazianzen 's assertion of parallel holiness between the prepurified Mary and purified Jesus of the New Testament is made even more explicit in Damascene in his discourse on Mary 's holiness to also imitate Christ 's baptism at the Jordan . The Damascene 's hymnongraphy and De fide Orthodoxa explicitly use Mary 's " pre purification " as a key to understanding her absolute holiness and unsullied human nature . In fact , Damascene ( along with Nazianzen ) serves as the source for nearly all subsequent promotion of Mary 's complete holiness from her Conception by the " all pure seed " of Joachim and the womb " wider than heaven " of St. Ann .
The first favours a primordialist approach which takes the sense of self and belonging to a collective group as a fixed thing , defined by objective criteria such as common ancestry and common biological characteristics . The second , rooted in social constructionist theory , takes the view that identity is formed by a predominantly political choice of certain characteristics . In so doing , it questions the idea that identity is a natural given , characterised by fixed , supposedly objective criteria . Both approaches need to be understood in their respective political and historical contexts , characterised by debate on issues of class , race and ethnicity . While they have been criticized , they continue to exert an influence on approaches to the conceptualisation of identity today .
In 2007 , BSkyB and Virgin Media became involved in a dispute over the carriage of Sky channels on cable TV . The failure to renew the existing carriage agreements negotiated with NTL and Telewest resulted in Virgin Media removing the basic channels from the network on 1 March 2007 . Virgin Media claimed that BSkyB had substantially increased the asking price for the channels , a claim which BSkyB denied , on the basis that their new deal offered " substantially more value " by including HD channels and Video On Demand content which was not previously carried by cable .
The official policy became one of biological and cultural assimilation : " Eliminate the full-blood and permit the white admixture to half-castes and eventually the race will become white " . This led to different treatment for " black " and " half-caste " individuals , with lighter-skinned individuals targeted for removal from their families to be raised as " white " people , restricted from speaking their native language and practising traditional customs , a process now known as the Stolen Generation .
With 4:51 left in regulation , Carolina got the ball on their own 24-yard line with a chance to mount a game-winning drive , and soon faced 3rd-and-9 . On the next play , Miller stripped the ball away from Newton , and after several players dove for it , it took a long bounce backwards and was recovered by Ward , who returned it five yards to the Panthers 4-yard line . Although several players dove into the pile to attempt to recover it , Newton did not and his lack of aggression later earned him heavy criticism . Meanwhile , Denver 's offense was kept out of the end zone for three plays , but a holding penalty on cornerback Josh Norman gave the Broncos a new set of downs . Then Anderson scored on a 2-yard touchdown run and Manning completed a pass to Bennie Fowler for a 2-point conversion , giving Denver a 24–10 lead with 3:08 left and essentially putting the game away . Carolina had two more drives , but failed to get a first down on each one .
In January 1519 , at Altenburg in Saxony , the papal nuncio Karl von Miltitz adopted a more conciliatory approach . Luther made certain concessions to the Saxon , who was a relative of the Elector , and promised to remain silent if his opponents did . The theologian Johann Eck , however , was determined to expose Luther 's doctrine in a public forum . In June and July 1519 , he staged a disputation with Luther 's colleague Andreas Karlstadt at Leipzig and invited Luther to speak . Luther 's boldest assertion in the debate was that Matthew 16:18 does not confer on popes the exclusive right to interpret scripture , and that therefore neither popes nor church councils were infallible . For this , Eck branded Luther a new Jan Hus , referring to the Czech reformer and heretic burned at the stake in 1415 . From that moment , he devoted himself to Luther 's defeat .
Luther had been suffering from ill health for years , including Ménière 's disease , vertigo , fainting , tinnitus , and a cataract in one eye . From 1531 to 1546 , his health deteriorated further . The years of struggle with Rome , the antagonisms with and among his fellow reformers , and the scandal which ensued from the bigamy of the Philip of Hesse incident , in which Luther had played a leading role , all may have contributed . In 1536 , he began to suffer from kidney and bladder stones , and arthritis , and an ear infection ruptured an ear drum . In December 1544 , he began to feel the effects of angina .
Egypt was producing 691,000 bbl/d of oil and 2,141.05 Tcf of natural gas ( in 2013 ) , which makes Egypt as the largest oil producer not member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries ( OPEC ) and the second-largest dry natural gas producer in Africa . In 2013 , Egypt was the largest consumer of oil and natural gas in Africa , as more than 20 % of total oil consumption and more than 40 % of total dry natural gas consumption in Africa . Also , Egypt possesses the largest oil refinery capacity in Africa 726,000 bbl/d ( in 2012 ) . Egypt is currently planning to build its first nuclear power plant in El Dabaa city , northern Egypt .
The Byzantines were able to regain control of the country after a brief Sasanian Persian invasion early in the 7th century amidst the Byzantine–Sasanian War of 602–628 during which they established a new short-lived province for ten years known as Sasanian Egypt , until 639–42 , when Egypt was invaded and conquered by the Islamic Empire by the Muslim Arabs . When they defeated the Byzantine Armies in Egypt , the Arabs brought Sunni Islam to the country . Early in this period , Egyptians began to blend their new faith with indigenous beliefs and practices , leading to various Sufi orders that have flourished to this day . These earlier rites had survived the period of Coptic Christianity .
The Lutheran theologian Franz Pieper observed that Luther 's teaching about the state of the Christian 's soul after death differed from the later Lutheran theologians such as Johann Gerhard . Lessing ( 1755 ) had earlier reached the same conclusion in his analysis of Lutheran orthodoxy on this issue .
Further claims were made that the Roman Catholic Church derives its doctrine from the Islamic teaching . In volume 5 of his Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire , published in 1788 , Edward Gibbon wrote : " The Latin Church has not disdained to borrow from the Koran the immaculate conception of his virgin mother . " That he was speaking of her immaculate conception by her mother , not of her own virginal conception of Jesus , is shown by his footnote : " In the xiith century the immaculate conception was condemned by St. Bernard as a presumptuous novelty . " In the aftermath of the definition of the dogma in 1854 , this charge was repeated : " Strange as it may appear , that the doctrine which the church of Rome has promulgated , with so much pomp and ceremony , 'for the destruction of all heresies , and the confirmation of the faith of her adherents ' , should have its origin in the Mohametan Bible ; yet the testimony of such authorities as Gibbon , and Sale , and Forster , and Gagnier , and Maracci , leave no doubt as to the marvellous fact . "
Another misunderstanding is that , by her immaculate conception , Mary did not need a saviour . When defining the dogma in Ineffabilis Deus , Pope Pius IX explicitly affirmed that Mary was redeemed in a manner more sublime . He stated that Mary , rather than being cleansed after sin , was completely prevented from contracting Original Sin in view of the foreseen merits of Jesus Christ , the Savior of the human race . In Luke 1:47 , Mary proclaims : " My spirit has rejoiced in God my Saviour . " This is referred to as Mary 's pre-redemption by Christ . Since the Second Council of Orange against semi-pelagianism , the Catholic Church has taught that even had man never sinned in the Garden of Eden and was sinless , he would still require God 's grace to remain sinless .
Though almost any variety of acoustic mandolin might be adequate for Irish traditional music , virtually all Irish players prefer flat-backed instruments with oval sound holes to the Italian-style bowl-back mandolins or the carved-top mandolins with f-holes favoured by bluegrass mandolinists . The former are often too soft-toned to hold their own in a session ( as well as having a tendency to not stay in place on the player 's lap ) , whilst the latter tend to sound harsh and overbearing to the traditional ear . The f-hole mandolin , however , does come into its own in a traditional session , where its brighter tone cuts through the sonic clutter of a pub . Greatly preferred for formal performance and recording are flat-topped " Irish-style " mandolins ( reminiscent of the WWI-era Martin Army-Navy mandolin ) and carved ( arch ) top mandolins with oval soundholes , such as the Gibson A-style of the 1920s .
Drinking water supply and sanitation in Egypt is characterised by both achievements and challenges . Among the achievements are an increase of piped water supply between 1990 and 2010 from 89 % to 100 % in urban areas and from 39 % to 93 % in rural areas despite rapid population growth , the elimination of open defecation in rural areas during the same period , and in general a relatively high level of investment in infrastructure . Access to an improved water source in Egypt is now practically universal with a rate of 99 % . About one half of the population is connected to sanitary sewers .
An apoplectic stroke deprived him of his speech , and he died shortly afterwards at 2:45 a.m. on 18 February 1546 , aged 62 , in Eisleben , the city of his birth . He was buried in the Castle Church in Wittenberg , beneath the pulpit . The funeral was held by his friends Johannes Bugenhagen and Philipp Melanchthon . A year later , troops of Luther 's adversary Charles V , Holy Roman Emperor entered the town , but were ordered by Charles not to disturb the grave .
From the years 1500 to 1850 , an estimated 3.5 million captives were forcibly shipped from West/Central Africa to Brazil ; the territory received the highest number of slaves of any country in the Americas . Scholars estimate that more than half of the Brazilian population is at least in part descended from these individuals . Brazil has the largest population of Afro-descendants outside of Africa . In contrast to the US , during the slavery period and after , the Portuguese colonial government and later Brazilian government did not pass formal anti-miscegenation or segregation laws . As in other Latin countries , intermarriage was prevalent during the colonial period and continued afterward . In addition , people of mixed race ( pardo ) often tended to marry white , and their descendants became accepted as white . As a result , some of the European descended population also has West African or Amerindian blood . According to the last census of the 20th century , in which Brazilians could choose from five color/ethnic categories with which they identified , 54 % of individuals identified as white , 6.2 % identified as black , and 39.5 % identified as pardo ( brown ) — a broad multi-racial category , including tri-racial persons .
SC Bern is the major ice hockey team of Bern who plays at the PostFinance Arena . The team has ranked highest in attendance for a European hockey team for more than a decade . The PostFinance Arena was the main host of the 2009 IIHF Ice Hockey World Championship , including the opening game and the final of the tournament .

Johann Eck , speaking on behalf of the Empire as assistant of the Archbishop of Trier , presented Luther with copies of his writings laid out on a table and asked him if the books were his , and whether he stood by their contents . Luther confirmed he was their author , but requested time to think about the answer to the second question . He prayed , consulted friends , and gave his response the next day :
BSkyB 's standard definition broadcasts are in DVB-compliant MPEG-2 , with the Sky Movies and Sky Box Office channels including optional Dolby Digital soundtracks for recent films , although these are only accessible with a Sky+ box . Sky+ HD material is broadcast using MPEG-4 and most of the HD material uses the DVB-S2 standard . Interactive services and 7-day EPG use the proprietary OpenTV system , with set-top boxes including modems for a return path . Sky News , amongst other channels , provides a pseudo-video on demand interactive service by broadcasting looping video streams .
Six-time Grammy winner and Academy Award nominee Lady Gaga performed the national anthem , while Academy Award winner Marlee Matlin provided American Sign Language ( ASL ) translation .
Even as the Western Roman empire collapsed , literate men acknowledged that Virgil was a master poet . Gregory of Tours read Virgil , whom he quotes in several places , along with some other Latin poets , though he cautions that " we ought not to relate their lying fables , lest we fall under sentence of eternal death . "
The annual NFL Experience was held at the Moscone Center in San Francisco . In addition , " Super Bowl City " opened on January 30 at Justin Herman Plaza on The Embarcadero , featuring games and activities that will highlight the Bay Area 's technology , culinary creations , and cultural diversity . More than 1 million people are expected to attend the festivities in San Francisco during Super Bowl Week . San Francisco mayor Ed Lee said of the highly visible homeless presence in this area " they are going to have to leave " . San Francisco city supervisor Jane Kim unsuccessfully lobbied for the NFL to reimburse San Francisco for city services in the amount of $ 5 million .
In September 2015 , the 193 member states of the United Nations unanimously adopted the Sustainable Development Goals , a set of 17 goals aiming to transform the world over the next 15 years . These goals are designed to eliminate poverty , discrimination , abuse and preventable deaths , address environmental destruction , and usher in an era of development for all people , everywhere .
Carolina suffered a major setback when Thomas Davis , an 11-year veteran who had already overcome three ACL tears in his career , went down with a broken arm in the NFC Championship Game . Despite this , he insisted he would still find a way to play in the Super Bowl . His prediction turned out to be accurate .
Western political philosophy originates in the philosophy of ancient Greece , where political philosophy dates back to at least Plato . Ancient Greece was dominated by city-states , which experimented with various forms of political organization , grouped by Plato into four categories : timocracy , tyranny , democracy and oligarchy . One of the first , extremely important classical works of political philosophy is Plato 's Republic , which was followed by Aristotle 's Nichomachean Ethics and Politics . Roman political philosophy was influenced by the Stoics , including the Roman statesman Cicero .
Concerns were raised over whether Levi 's Stadium 's field was of a high enough quality to host a Super Bowl ; during the inaugural season , the field had to be re-sodded multiple times due to various issues , and during a week 6 game earlier in the 2015 season , a portion of the turf collapsed under Baltimore Ravens kicker Justin Tucker , causing him to slip and miss a field goal , although the field has not had any major issues since . As is customary for Super Bowl games played at natural grass stadiums , the NFL re-sodded the field with a new playing surface ; a hybrid Bermuda 419 turf . NFL and Atlanta Braves field director Ed Mangan stated that the field was in " great shape " for gameday . However , the turf showed problem throughout the game , with a number of players needing to change their cleats during the game and player slipping during plays all throughout the game .
The Super Bowl 50 Host Committee has vowed to be " the most giving Super Bowl ever " , and will dedicate 25 percent of all money it raises for philanthropic causes in the Bay Area .

In addition , there are $ 2 million worth of other ancillary events , including a week-long event at the Santa Clara Convention Center , a beer , wine and food festival at Bellomy Field at Santa Clara University , and a pep rally . A professional fundraiser will aid in finding business sponsors and individual donors , but still may need the city council to help fund the event . Additional funding will be provided by the city council , which has announced plans to set aside seed funding for the event .
In 1929 , ARC was founded through a merger of several smaller record companies , which , ultimately , transformed into one enterprise known as SME . In the depths of the Great Depression , the Columbia Phonograph Company ( founded in 1888 ) in the U.S. ( including its Okeh Records subsidiary ) was acquired by ARC in 1934 .
The Siddi are an ethnic group inhabiting India and Pakistan whose members are descended from Bantu peoples from Southeast Africa that were brought to the Indian subcontinent as slaves by Arab and Portuguese merchants . Although it is commonly believed locally that " Siddi " derives from a word meaning " black " , the term is actually derived from " Sayyid " , the title borne by the captains of the Arab vessels that first brought Siddi settlers to the area . In the Makran strip of the Sindh and Balochistan provinces in southwestern Pakistan , these Bantu descendants are known as the Makrani . There was a brief " Black Power " movement in Sindh in the 1960s and many Siddi are proud of and celebrate their African ancestry .
Although one of the main obstacles still facing the Egyptian economy is the limited trickle down of wealth to the average population , many Egyptians criticise their government for higher prices of basic goods while their standards of living or purchasing power remains relatively stagnant . Corruption is often cited by Egyptians as the main impediment to further economic growth . The government promised major reconstruction of the country 's infrastructure , using money paid for the newly acquired third mobile license ( $ 3 billion ) by Etisalat in 2006 . In the Corruption Perceptions Index 2013 , Egypt was ranked 114 out of 177 .

The Rose Garden ( Rosengarten ) , from which a scenic panoramic view of the medieval town centre can be enjoyed , is a well-kept Rosarium on a hill , converted into a park from a former cemetery in 1913 .
Genetic studies have found significant African female-mediated gene flow in Arab communities in the Arabian Peninsula and neighboring countries , with an average of 38 % of maternal lineages in Yemen are of direct African descent , 16 % in Oman-Qatar , and 10 % in Saudi Arabia-United Arab Emirates .
The mandolin orchestras never completely went away , however . In fact , along with all the other musical forms the mandolin is involved with , the mandolin ensemble ( groups usually arranged like the string section of a modern symphony orchestra , with first mandolins , second mandolins , mandolas , mandocellos , mando-basses , and guitars , and sometimes supplemented by other instruments ) continues to grow in popularity . Since the mid-nineties , several public-school mandolin-based guitar programs have blossomed around the country , including Fretworks Mandolin and Guitar Orchestra , the first of its kind . The national organization , Classical Mandolin Society of America , founded by Norman Levine , represents these groups . Prominent modern mandolinists and composers for mandolin in the classical music tradition include Samuel Firstman , Howard Fry , Rudy Cipolla , Dave Apollon , Neil Gladd , Evan Marshall , Marilynn Mair and Mark Davis ( the Mair-Davis Duo ) , Brian Israel , David Evans , Emanuil Shynkman , Radim Zenkl , David Del Tredici and Ernst Krenek .
The definition makes no declaration about the Church 's belief that the Blessed Virgin was sinless in the sense of freedom from actual or personal sin . However , the Church holds that Mary was also sinless personally , " free from all sin , original or personal " . The Council of Trent decreed : " If anyone shall say that a man once justified can sin no more , nor lose grace , and that therefore he who falls and sins was never truly justified ; or , on the contrary , that throughout his whole life he can avoid all sins even venial sins , except by a special privilege of God , as the Church holds in regard to the Blessed Virgin : let him be anathema . "
In contrast to the views of John Calvin and Philipp Melanchthon , throughout his life Luther maintained that it was not false doctrine to believe that a Christian 's soul sleeps after it is separated from the body in death ; and , accordingly , he disputed traditional interpretations of some Bible passages , such as the parable of the rich man and Lazarus . This also led Luther to reject the idea of torments for the saints : " It is enough for us to know that souls do not leave their bodies to be threatened by the torments and punishments of hell , but enter a prepared bedchamber in which they sleep in peace . " He also rejected the existence of Purgatory , which involved Christian souls undergoing penitential suffering after death . He affirmed the continuity of one 's personal identity beyond death . In his Smalcald Articles , he described the saints as currently residing " in their graves and in heaven . "
In the Late Empire and Middle Ages Vergilius was spelled Virgilius . Two explanations are commonly given for this alteration . One deduces a false etymology associated with the word virgo ( " maiden " in Latin ) due to Virgil 's excessive , " maiden " -like modesty . Alternatively , some argue that Vergilius was altered to Virgilius by analogy with the Latin virga ( " wand " ) due to the magical or prophetic powers attributed to Virgil in the Middle Ages ( this explanation is found in only a handful of manuscripts , however , and was probably not widespread ) . In Norman schools ( following the French practice ) , the habit was to anglicize Latin names by dropping their Latin endings , hence Virgil . In the 19th century , some German-trained classicists in the United States suggested modification to Vergil , as it is closer to his original name , and is also the traditional German spelling . [ citation needed ] Modern usage permits both , though the Oxford guide to style recommends Vergilius to avoid confusion with the 8th-century grammarian Virgilius Maro Grammaticus . Some post-Renaissance writers liked to affect the sobriquet " The Swan of Mantua " . [ citation needed ]
In 1630 , Pope Urban VIII decreed their title to be Eminence ( previously , it had been " illustrissimo " and " reverendissimo " ) and decreed that their secular rank would equate to Prince , making them secondary only to the Pope and crowned monarchs .
On 18 January 2014 , the interim government successfully institutionalised a more secular constitution . The president is elected to a four-year term and may serve 2 terms . The parliament may impeach the president . Under the constitution , there is a guarantee of gender equality and absolute freedom of thought . The military retains the ability to appoint the national Minister of Defence for the next 8 years . Under the constitution , political parties may not be based on " religion , race , gender or geography " .
Sandra Laing is a South African woman who was classified as Coloured by authorities during the apartheid era , due to her skin colour and hair texture , although her parents could prove at least three generations of European ancestors . At age 10 , she was expelled from her all-white school . The officials ' decisions based on her anomalous appearance disrupted her family and adult life . She was the subject of the 2008 biographical dramatic film Skin , which won numerous awards .
Martin Luther , who initiated the Protestant Reformation , said : " Mother Mary , like us , was born in sin of sinful parents , but the Holy Spirit covered her , sanctified and purified her so that this child was born of flesh and blood , but not with sinful flesh and blood . The Holy Spirit permitted the Virgin Mary to remain a true , natural human being of flesh and blood , just as we . However , he warded off sin from her flesh and blood so that she became the mother of a pure child , not poisoned by sin as we are . For in that moment when she conceived , she was a holy mother filled with the Holy Spirit and her fruit is a holy pure fruit , at once God and truly man , in one person . " Some Lutherans , such as the members of the Anglo-Lutheran Catholic Church , support the doctrine .
Denver took the opening kickoff and started out strong with Peyton Manning completing an 18-yard pass to tight end Owen Daniels and a 22-yard throw to receiver Andre Caldwell . A pair of carries by C. J. Anderson moved the ball up 20 yards to the Panthers 14-yard line , but Carolina 's defense dug in over the next three plays . First , linebacker Shaq Thompson tackled Ronnie Hillman for a 3-yard loss . Then after an incompletion , Thomas Davis tackled Anderson for a 1-yard gain on third down , forcing Denver to settle for a 3–0 lead on a Brandon McManus 34-yard field goal . The score marked the first time in the entire postseason that Carolina was facing a deficit .
A number of congresses of the socialist First and Second Internationals were held in Bern , particularly during World War I when Switzerland was neutral ; see Bern International .
Black people is a term used in certain countries , often in socially based systems of racial classification or of ethnicity , to describe persons who are perceived to be dark-skinned compared to other given populations . As such , the meaning of the expression varies widely both between and within societies , and depends significantly on context . For many other individuals , communities and countries , " black " is also perceived as a derogatory , outdated , reductive or otherwise unrepresentative label , and as a result is neither used nor defined .
With Rivera having been a linebacker with the Chicago Bears in Super Bowl XX , and Kubiak replacing Elway at the end of the Broncos ' defeats in Super Bowls XXI and XXIV , this will be the first Super Bowl in which both head coaches played in the game themselves .
Egypt also hosts an unknown number of refugees and asylum seekers , estimated to be between 500,000 and 3 million . There are some 70,000 Palestinian refugees , and about 150,000 recently arrived Iraqi refugees , but the number of the largest group , the Sudanese , is contested . [ nb 1 ] The once-vibrant and ancient Greek and Jewish communities in Egypt have almost disappeared , with only a small number remaining in the country , but many Egyptian Jews visit on religious or other occasions and tourism . Several important Jewish archaeological and historical sites are found in Cairo , Alexandria and other cities .
A pair of overlapping political perspectives arising toward the end of the 20th century are republicanism ( or neo- or civic-republicanism ) and the capability approach . The resurgent republican movement aims to provide an alternate definition of liberty from Isaiah Berlin 's positive and negative forms of liberty , namely " liberty as non-domination . " Unlike liberals who understand liberty as " non-interference , " " non-domination " entails individuals not being subject to the arbitrary will of anyother person . To a liberal , a slave who is not interfered with may be free , yet to a republican the mere status as a slave , regardless of how that slave is treated , is objectionable . Prominent republicans include historian Quentin Skinner , jurist Cass Sunstein , and political philosopher Philip Pettit . The capability approach , pioneered by economists Mahbub ul Haq and Amartya Sen and further developed by legal scholar Martha Nussbaum , understands freedom under allied lines : the real-world ability to act . Both the capability approach and republicanism treat choice as something which must be resourced . In other words , it is not enough to be legally able to do something , but to have the real option of doing it .
Similar alloys with the addition of a small amount of lead can be cold-rolled into sheets . An alloy of 96 % zinc and 4 % aluminium is used to make stamping dies for low production run applications for which ferrous metal dies would be too expensive . In building facades , roofs or other applications in which zinc is used as sheet metal and for methods such as deep drawing , roll forming or bending , zinc alloys with titanium and copper are used . Unalloyed zinc is too brittle for these kinds of manufacturing processes .
Martin Luther ( /ˈluːθər/ or /ˈluːðər/ ; German : [ ˈmaɐ̯tiːn ˈlʊtɐ ] ( listen ) ; 10 November 1483 – 18 February 1546 ) was a German professor of theology , composer , priest , former monk and a seminal figure in the Protestant Reformation . Luther came to reject several teachings and practices of the Late Medieval Catholic Church . He strongly disputed the claim that freedom from God 's punishment for sin could be purchased with money . He proposed an academic discussion of the power and usefulness of indulgences in his Ninety-Five Theses of 1517 . His refusal to retract all of his writings at the demand of Pope Leo X in 1520 and the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V at the Diet of Worms in 1521 resulted in his excommunication by the Pope and condemnation as an outlaw by the Emperor .
Despite his victory in Wittenberg , Luther was unable to stifle radicalism further afield . Preachers such as Zwickau prophet Nicholas Storch and Thomas Müntzer helped instigate the German Peasants ' War of 1524–25 , during which many atrocities were committed , often in Luther 's name . There had been revolts by the peasantry on a smaller scale since the 15th century . Luther 's pamphlets against the Church and the hierarchy , often worded with " liberal " phraseology , now led many peasants to believe he would support an attack on the upper classes in general . Revolts broke out in Franconia , Swabia , and Thuringia in 1524 , even drawing support from disaffected nobles , many of whom were in debt . Gaining momentum under the leadership of radicals such as Müntzer in Thuringia and Michael Gaismair in Tyrol , the revolts turned into war .
The annual NFL Experience was held at the Moscone Center in San Francisco . In addition , " Super Bowl City " opened on January 30 at Justin Herman Plaza on The Embarcadero , featuring games and activities that will highlight the Bay Area 's technology , culinary creations , and cultural diversity . More than 1 million people are expected to attend the festivities in San Francisco during Super Bowl Week . San Francisco mayor Ed Lee said of the highly visible homeless presence in this area " they are going to have to leave " . San Francisco city supervisor Jane Kim unsuccessfully lobbied for the NFL to reimburse San Francisco for city services in the amount of $ 5 million .
The Aeneid is widely considered Virgil 's finest work and one of the most important poems in the history of western literature . Virgil worked on the Aeneid during the last eleven years of his life ( 29–19 BC ) , commissioned , according to Propertius , by Augustus . The epic poem consists of 12 books in dactylic hexameter verse which describe the journey of Aeneas , a warrior fleeing the sack of Troy , to Italy , his battle with the Italian prince Turnus , and the foundation of a city from which Rome would emerge . The Aeneid 's first six books describe the journey of Aeneas from Troy to Rome . Virgil made use of several models in the composition of his epic ; Homer , the preeminent author of classical epic , is everywhere present , but Virgil also makes special use of the Latin poet Ennius and the Hellenistic poet Apollonius of Rhodes among the various other writers to which he alludes . Although the Aeneid casts itself firmly into the epic mode , it often seeks to expand the genre by including elements of other genres such as tragedy and aetiological poetry . Ancient commentators noted that Virgil seems to divide the Aeneid into two sections based on the poetry of Homer ; the first six books were viewed as employing the Odyssey as a model while the last six were connected to the Iliad .
In Bern , about 50,418 or ( 39.2 % ) of the population have completed non-mandatory upper secondary education , and 24,311 or ( 18.9 % ) have completed additional higher education ( either university or a Fachhochschule ) . Of the 24,311 who completed tertiary schooling , 51.6 % were Swiss men , 33.0 % were Swiss women , 8.9 % were non-Swiss men and 6.5 % were non-Swiss women .
ARC was acquired in 1938 by the Columbia Broadcasting System ( CBS , which , in turn , had been formed by the Columbia Phonograph Company , but then sold off ) . ARC was renamed Columbia Recording Corporation . The Columbia Phonograph Company had international subsidiaries and affiliates such as the Columbia Graphophone Company in the United Kingdom , but they were sold off prior to CBS acquiring American Columbia . RCA Victor Records executive Ted Wallerstein convinced CBS head William S. Paley to buy ARC and Paley made Wallerstein head of the newly acquired record company . The renamed company made Columbia its flagship label with Okeh its subsidiary label while deemphasizing ARC 's other labels . This allowed ARC 's leased labels Brunswick Records and Vocalion Records to revert to former owner Warner Bros. which sold the labels to Decca Records . Columbia kept the Brunswick catalogue recorded from December 1931 onward which was reissued on the Columbia label as well as the Vocalion label material from the same time period which was reissued on the Okeh label . Wallerstein , who was promoted at the end of 1947 from president to chairman of the record company , restored Columbia 's status as a leading record company and spearheaded the successful introduction of the long playing ( LP ) record before he retired as Columbia 's chairman in 1951 . James Conkling then became head of Columbia Records . Also in 1951 , Columbia severed its ties with the EMI-owned record label of the same name and began a UK distribution deal with Philips Records , whereas Okeh Records continued to be distributed by EMI on the Columbia label .
The Broncos defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers in the divisional round , 23–16 , by scoring 11 points in the final three minutes of the game . They then beat the defending Super Bowl XLIX champion New England Patriots in the AFC Championship Game , 20–18 , by intercepting a pass on New England 's 2-point conversion attempt with 17 seconds left on the clock . Despite Manning 's problems with interceptions during the season , he did n't throw any in their two playoff games .
In the United States , the game was televised by CBS , as part of a cycle between the three main broadcast television partners of the NFL . The network 's lead broadcast team of Jim Nantz and Phil Simms called the contest , with Tracy Wolfson and Evan Washburn on the sidelines . CBS introduced new features during the telecast , including pylon cameras and microphones along with EyeVision 360—an array of 36 cameras along the upper deck that can be used to provide a 360-degree view of plays and " bullet time " effects . ( An earlier version of EyeVision was last used in Super Bowl XXXV ; for Super Bowl 50 , the cameras were upgraded to 5K resolution . )
These patterns of discrimination against non-whites have led some academic and other activists to advocate for use of the Portuguese term negro to encompass all African-descended people , in order to stimulate a " black " consciousness and identity . This proposal has been criticized since the term pardo is considered to include a wide range of multiracial people , such as caboclos ( mestizos ) , assimilated Amerindians and tri-racials , not only people of partial African and European descent . Trying to identify this entire group as " black " would be a false imposition of a different identity from outside the culture and deny people their other , equally valid , ancestries and cultures . It seems a one-drop rule in reverse .
As of 2000 [ update ] , there were 67,115 private households in the municipality , and an average of 1.8 persons per household .

The game 's media day , which was typically held on the Tuesday afternoon prior to the game , was moved to the Monday evening and re-branded as Super Bowl Opening Night . The event was held on February 1 , 2016 at SAP Center in San Jose . Alongside the traditional media availabilities , the event featured an opening ceremony with player introductions on a replica of the Golden Gate Bridge .
In 525 BC , the powerful Achaemenid Persians , led by Cambyses II , began their conquest of Egypt , eventually capturing the pharaoh Psamtik III at the battle of Pelusium . Cambyses II then assumed the formal title of pharaoh , but ruled Egypt from his home of Susa in Persia ( modern Iran ) , leaving Egypt under the control of a satrapy . The entire Twenty-seventh Dynasty of Egypt , from 525 BC to 402 BC , save for Petubastis III , was an entirely Persian ruled period , with the Achaemenid kings all being granted the title of pharaoh . A few temporarily successful revolts against the Persians marked the fifth century BC , but Egypt was never able to permanently overthrow the Persians .

The Panthers used the San Jose State practice facility and stayed at the San Jose Marriott . The Broncos practiced at Stanford University and stayed at the Santa Clara Marriott .
The Suez Canal , built in partnership with the French , was completed in 1869 . Its construction led to enormous debt to European banks , and caused popular discontent because of the onerous taxation it required . In 1875 Ismail was forced to sell Egypt 's share in the canal to the British Government . Within three years this led to the imposition of British and French controllers who sat in the Egyptian cabinet , and , " with the financial power of the bondholders behind them , were the real power in the Government . "
Some priests and former religious had already married , including Andreas Karlstadt and Justus Jonas , but Luther 's wedding set the seal of approval on clerical marriage . He had long condemned vows of celibacy on Biblical grounds , but his decision to marry surprised many , not least Melanchthon , who called it reckless . Luther had written to George Spalatin on 30 November 1524 , " I shall never take a wife , as I feel at present . Not that I am insensible to my flesh or sex ( for I am neither wood nor stone ) ; but my mind is averse to wedlock because I daily expect the death of a heretic . " Before marrying , Luther had been living on the plainest food , and , as he admitted himself , his mildewed bed was not properly made for months at a time .
Modern Egypt is considered to be a regional and middle power , with significant cultural , political , and military influence in North Africa , the Middle East and the Muslim world . Its economy is one of the largest and most diversified in the Middle East , with sectors such as tourism , agriculture , industry and services at almost equal production levels . In 2011 , longtime President Hosni Mubarak stepped down amid mass protests . Later elections saw the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood , which was ousted by the army a year later amid mass protests .
As the designated home team in the annual rotation between AFC and NFC teams , the Broncos elected to wear their road white jerseys with matching white pants . Elway stated , " We 've had Super Bowl success in our white uniforms . " The Broncos last wore matching white jerseys and pants in the Super Bowl in Super Bowl XXXIII , Elway 's last game as Denver QB , when they defeated the Atlanta Falcons 34–19 . In their only other Super Bowl win in Super Bowl XXXII , Denver wore blue jerseys , which was their primary color at the time . They also lost Super Bowl XXI when they wore white jerseys , but they are 0-4 in Super Bowls when wearing orange jerseys , losing in Super Bowl XII , XXII , XXIV , and XLVIII . The only other AFC champion team to have worn white as the designated home team in the Super Bowl was the Pittsburgh Steelers ; they defeated the Seattle Seahawks 21–10 in Super Bowl XL 10 seasons prior . The Broncos ' decision to wear white meant the Panthers would wear their standard home uniform : black jerseys with silver pants .
Laing 's definition of identity closely follows Erikson 's , in emphasising the past , present and future components of the experienced self . He also develops the concept of the " metaperspective of self " , i.e . the self 's perception of the other 's view of self , which has been found to be extremely important in clinical contexts such as anorexia nervosa . ( Saunderson and O'Kane , 2005 ) . Harré also conceptualises components of self/identity – the " person " ( the unique being I am to myself and others ) along with aspects of self ( including a totality of attributes including beliefs about one 's characteristics including life history ) , and the personal characteristics displayed to others .
CBS provided digital streams of the game via CBSSports.com , and the CBS Sports apps on tablets , Windows 10 , Xbox One and other digital media players ( such as Chromecast and Roku ) . Due to Verizon Communications exclusivity , streaming on smartphones was only provided to Verizon Wireless customers via the NFL Mobile service . The ESPN Deportes Spanish broadcast was made available through WatchESPN .
In response to demands for a German liturgy , Luther wrote a German Mass , which he published in early 1526 . He did not intend it as a replacement for his 1523 adaptation of the Latin Mass but as an alternative for the " simple people " , a " public stimulation for people to believe and become Christians . " Luther based his order on the Catholic service but omitted " everything that smacks of sacrifice " ; and the Mass became a celebration where everyone received the wine as well as the bread . He retained the elevation of the host and chalice , while trappings such as the Mass vestments , altar , and candles were made optional , allowing freedom of ceremony . Some reformers , including followers of Huldrych Zwingli , considered Luther 's service too papistic ; and modern scholars note the conservatism of his alternative to the Catholic mass . Luther 's service , however , included congregational singing of hymns and psalms in German , as well as of parts of the liturgy , including Luther 's unison setting of the Creed . To reach the simple people and the young , Luther incorporated religious instruction into the weekday services in the form of the catechism . He also provided simplified versions of the baptism and marriage services .
Drinking water supply and sanitation in Egypt is characterised by both achievements and challenges . Among the achievements are an increase of piped water supply between 1990 and 2010 from 89 % to 100 % in urban areas and from 39 % to 93 % in rural areas despite rapid population growth , the elimination of open defecation in rural areas during the same period , and in general a relatively high level of investment in infrastructure . Access to an improved water source in Egypt is now practically universal with a rate of 99 % . About one half of the population is connected to sanitary sewers .
Publius Vergilius Maro ( Classical Latin : [ ˈpuː.blɪ.ʊs wɛrˈɡɪ.lɪ.ʊs ˈma.roː ] ; October 15 , 70 BC – September 21 , 19 BC ) , usually called Virgil or Vergil /ˈvɜːrdʒᵻl/ in English , was an ancient Roman poet of the Augustan period . He is known for three major works of Latin literature , the Eclogues ( or Bucolics ) , the Georgics , and the epic Aeneid . A number of minor poems , collected in the Appendix Vergiliana , are sometimes attributed to him .
Beginning with the Paris Exposition of 1878 , the instrument 's popularity rebounded . The Exposition was one of many stops for a popular new performing group the Estudiantes Españoles ( Spanish Students ) . They danced and played guitars , violins and the bandurria , which became confused with the mandolin . Along with the energy and awareness created by the day 's hit sensation , a wave of Italian mandolinists travelled Europe in the 1880s and 1890s and in the United States by the mid-1880s , playing and teaching their instrument . The instrument 's popularity continued to increase during the 1890s and mandolin popularity was at its height in " early years of the 20th century . " Thousands were taking up the instrument as a pastime , and it became an instrument of society , taken up by young men and women . Mandolin orchestras were formed worldwide , incorporating not only the mandolin family of instruments , but also guitars , double basses and zithers .
Zinc is more reactive than iron or steel and thus will attract almost all local oxidation until it completely corrodes away . A protective surface layer of oxide and carbonate ( Zn 5 ( OH ) 6 ( CO 3 ) 2 ) forms as the zinc corrodes . This protection lasts even after the zinc layer is scratched but degrades through time as the zinc corrodes away . The zinc is applied electrochemically or as molten zinc by hot-dip galvanizing or spraying . Galvanization is used on chain-link fencing , guard rails , suspension bridges , lightposts , metal roofs , heat exchangers , and car bodies .
After a punt from both teams , Carolina got on track with a 9-play , 73-yard scoring drive . Newton completed 4 of 4 passes for 51 yards and rushed twice for 25 yards , while Jonathan Stewart finished the drive with a 1-yard touchdown run , cutting the score to 10–7 with 11:28 left in the second quarter . Later on , Broncos receiver Jordan Norwood received Brad Nortman 's short 28-yard punt surrounded by Panthers players , but none of them attempted to make a tackle , apparently thinking Norwood had called a fair catch . Norwood had not done so , and with no resistance around him , he took off for a Super Bowl record 61-yard return before Mario Addison dragged him down on the Panthers 14-yard line . Despite Denver 's excellent field position , they could not get the ball into the end zone , so McManus kicked a 33-yard field goal that increased their lead to 13–7 .
UNFPA works in partnership with governments , along with other United Nations agencies , communities , NGOs , foundations and the private sector , to raise awareness and mobilize the support and resources needed to achieve its mission to promote the rights and health of women and young people .
When in choir dress , a Latin-rite cardinal wears scarlet garments — the blood-like red symbolizes a cardinal 's willingness to die for his faith . Excluding the rochet — which is always white — the scarlet garments include the cassock , mozzetta , and biretta ( over the usual scarlet zucchetto ) . The biretta of a cardinal is distinctive not merely for its scarlet color , but also for the fact that it does not have a pompon or tassel on the top as do the birettas of other prelates . Until the 1460s , it was customary for cardinals to wear a violet or blue cape unless granted the privilege of wearing red when acting on papal business . His normal-wear cassock is black but has scarlet piping and a scarlet fascia ( sash ) . Occasionally , a cardinal wears a scarlet ferraiolo which is a cape worn over the shoulders , tied at the neck in a bow by narrow strips of cloth in the front , without any 'trim ' or piping on it . It is because of the scarlet color of cardinals ' vesture that the bird of the same name has become known as such . [ citation needed ]
The U.S. census race definitions says a " black " is a person having origins in any of the black ( sub-Saharan ) racial groups of Africa . It includes people who indicate their race as " Black , African Am. , or Negro " or who provide written entries such as African American , Afro-American , Kenyan , Nigerian , or Haitian . The Census Bureau notes that these classifications are socio-political constructs and should not be interpreted as scientific or anthropological . Most African Americans also have European ancestry in varying amounts ; a lesser proportion have some Native American ancestry . For instance , genetic studies of African Americans show an ancestry that is on average 17–18 % European .

Luther came to reject several teachings and practices of the Late Medieval Catholic Church . He strongly disputed the claim that freedom from God 's punishment for sin could be purchased with money . He proposed an academic discussion of the power and usefulness of indulgences in his Ninety-Five Theses of 1517 . His refusal to retract all of his writings at the demand of Pope Leo X in 1520 and the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V at the Diet of Worms in 1521 resulted in his excommunication by the Pope and condemnation as an outlaw by the Emperor .
Manning finished the game 13 of 23 for 141 yards with one interception and zero touchdowns . Sanders was his top receiver with six receptions for 83 yards . Anderson was the game 's leading rusher with 90 yards and a touchdown , along with four receptions for 10 yards . Miller had six total tackles ( five solo ) , 2½ sacks , and two forced fumbles . Ware had five total tackles and two sacks . Ward had seven total tackles , a fumble recovery , and an interception . McManus made all four of his field goals , making him perfect on all 11 attempts during the post-season . Newton completed 18 of 41 passes for 265 yards , with one interception . He was also the team 's leading rusher with 45 yards on six carries . Brown caught four passes for 80 yards , while Ginn had four receptions for 74 . Ealy was the top defensive performer for Carolina with four total tackles , three sacks , a forced fumble , a fumble recovery , and an interception . Defensive End Charles Johnson had four total tackles , a sack , and a forced fumble . Linebacker Luke Kuechly had 11 total tackles , while Thomas Davis had seven , despite playing just two weeks after breaking his right arm in the NFC title game .
According to the Office for National Statistics , at the 2001 census there were over a million black people in the United Kingdom ; 1 % of the total population described themselves as " Black Caribbean " , 0.8 % as " Black African " , and 0.2 % as " Black other " . Britain encouraged the immigration of workers from the Caribbean after World War II ; the first symbolic movement was those who came on the ship the Empire Windrush . The preferred official umbrella term is " black and minority ethnic " ( BME ) , but sometimes the term " black " is used on its own , to express unified opposition to racism , as in the Southall Black Sisters , which started with a mainly British Asian constituency , and the National Black Police Association , which has a membership of " African , African-Caribbean and Asian origin " .
Luther was a prolific hymn-writer , authoring hymns such as " Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott " ( " A Mighty Fortress Is Our God " ) , based on Psalm 46 , and " Vom Himmel hoch , da komm ich her " ( " From Heaven Above to Earth I Come " ) , based on Luke 2:11–12 . Luther connected high art and folk music , also all classes , clergy and laity , men , women and children . His tool of choice for this connection was the singing of German hymns in connection with worship , school , home , and the public arena . He often accompanied the sung hymns with a lute , later recreated as the waldzither that became a national instrument of Germany in the 20th century .
Pennies and other small coins are sometimes ingested by dogs , resulting in the need for medical treatment to remove the foreign body . The zinc content of some coins can cause zinc toxicity , which is commonly fatal in dogs , where it causes a severe hemolytic anemia , and also liver or kidney damage ; vomiting and diarrhea are possible symptoms . Zinc is highly toxic in parrots and poisoning can often be fatal . The consumption of fruit juices stored in galvanized cans has resulted in mass parrot poisonings with zinc .
Others have rejected that the doctrine of Immaculate Conception exists in Islam , the Quranic account does not confirm the Immaculate Conception exclusively for Mary as in Islam every human child is born pure and immaculate , her sinless birth is thus independent of the Christian docrtrine of original sin as no such doctrine exists in Islam . Moreover , Hannah 's prayer in the Quran for her child to remain protected from Satan ( Shayṭān ) was said after it had already been born , not before and expresses a natural concern any righteous parent would have . The Muslim tradition or hadith , which states that the only children born without the " touch of Satan , " were Mary and Jesus . should therefore not be taken in isolation from the Quran , and is to be interpreted within the specific context of exonerating Mary and her child from the charges that were made against them and is not a general statement . The specific mention of Mary and Jesus in this hadith may also be taken to represent a class of people , in keeping with the Arabic language and the Quranic verse [ O Satan ] surely thou shalt have no power over My servants , except such of the erring ones as choose to follow thee ( 15:42 )
In 1523 , Luther wrote that Jesus Christ was born a Jew which discouraged mistreatment of the Jews and advocated their conversion by proving that the Old Testament could be shown to speak of Jesus Christ . However , as the Reformation continued , Luther began to lose hope in large-scale Jewish conversion to Christianity . In his later years , Luther grew more hostile toward the Jews , writing against them with the kind of venom he had already unleashed on the Anabaptists , Zwinglianism , and the papacy . His 1543 treatise Von den Juden und ihren Lügen ( On the Jews and Their Lies ) took its place among other anti-Jewish literature of the times , although historians acknowledge that this treatise was particularly extreme , even by the standards of sixteenth century Europe . In it , he takes a hardline against Judaism , writing that synagogues and Jewish homes should be destroyed , their money confiscated , and liberty curtailed . These statements and their influence on antisemitism have contributed to his controversial status .
The agreements include fixed annual carriage fees of £30m for the channels with both channel suppliers able to secure additional capped payments if their channels meet certain performance-related targets . Currently there is no indication as to whether the new deal includes the additional Video On Demand and High Definition content which had previously been offered by BSkyB . As part of the agreements , both BSkyB and Virgin Media agreed to terminate all High Court proceedings against each other relating to the carriage of their respective basic channels .
Hard rock entered the 1990s as one of the dominant forms of commercial music . The multi-platinum releases of AC/DC 's The Razors Edge ( 1990 ) , Guns N ' Roses ' Use Your Illusion I and Use Your Illusion II ( both in 1991 ) , Ozzy Osbourne 's No More Tears ( 1991 ) , and Van Halen 's For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge ( 1991 ) showcased this popularity . Additionally , The Black Crowes released their debut album , Shake Your Money Maker ( 1990 ) , which contained a bluesy classic rock sound and sold five million copies . In 1992 , Def Leppard followed up 1987 's Hysteria with Adrenalize , which went multi-platinum , spawned four Top 40 singles and held the number one spot on the US album chart for five weeks .
Drinking water supply and sanitation in Egypt is characterised by both achievements and challenges . Among the achievements are an increase of piped water supply between 1990 and 2010 from 89 % to 100 % in urban areas and from 39 % to 93 % in rural areas despite rapid population growth , the elimination of open defecation in rural areas during the same period , and in general a relatively high level of investment in infrastructure . Access to an improved water source in Egypt is now practically universal with a rate of 99 % . About one half of the population is connected to sanitary sewers .
In America , nonprofit organizations like Friends of UNFPA ( formerly Americans for UNFPA ) worked to compensate for the loss of United States federal funding by raising private donations .
However , the formation of one 's identity occurs through one 's identifications with significant others ( primarily with parents and other individuals during one 's biographical experiences , and also with " groups " as they are perceived ) . These others may be benign - such that one aspires to their characteristics , values and beliefs ( a process of idealistic-identification ) , or malign - when one wishes to dissociate from their characteristics ( a process of defensive contra-identification ) ( Weinreich & Saunderson 2003 , Chapter 1 , pp 54–61 ) .

In addition , there are $ 2 million worth of other ancillary events , including a week-long event at the Santa Clara Convention Center , a beer , wine and food festival at Bellomy Field at Santa Clara University , and a pep rally . A professional fundraiser will aid in finding business sponsors and individual donors , but still may need the city council to help fund the event . Additional funding will be provided by the city council , which has announced plans to set aside seed funding for the event .
Egypt has a wide range of beaches situated on the Mediterranean and the Red Sea that extend to over 3,000 km . The Red Sea has serene waters , coloured coral reefs , rare fish and beautiful mountains . The Akba Gulf beaches also provide facilities for practising sea sports . Safaga tops the Red Sea zone with its beautiful location on the Suez Gulf . Last but not least , Sharm el-Sheikh ( or City of Peace ) , Hurghada , Luxor ( known as world 's greatest open-air museum/ or City of the ⅓ of world monuments ) , Dahab , Ras Sidr , Marsa Alam , Safaga and the northern coast of the Mediterranean are major tourist 's destinations of the recreational tourism .
When Cowan Powers and his family recorded their old-time music from 1924-1926 , his daughter Orpha Powers was one of the earliest known southern-music artists to record with the mandolin . By the 1930s , single mandolins were becoming more commonly used in southern string band music , most notably by brother duets such as the sedate Blue Sky Boys ( Bill Bolick and Earl Bolick ) and the more hard-driving Monroe Brothers ( Bill Monroe and Charlie Monroe ) . However , the mandolin 's modern popularity in country music can be directly traced to one man : Bill Monroe , the father of bluegrass music . After the Monroe Brothers broke up in 1939 , Bill Monroe formed his own group , after a brief time called the Blue Grass Boys , and completed the transition of mandolin styles from a " parlor " sound typical of brother duets to the modern " bluegrass " style . He joined the Grand Ole Opry in 1939 and its powerful clear-channel broadcast signal on WSM-AM spread his style throughout the South , directly inspiring many musicians to take up the mandolin . Monroe famously played Gibson F-5 mandolin , signed and dated July 9 , 1923 , by Lloyd Loar , chief acoustic engineer at Gibson . The F-5 has since become the most imitated tonally and aesthetically by modern builders .
Luther 's 1524 creedal hymn " Wir glauben all an einen Gott " ( " We All Believe in One True God " ) is a three-stanza confession of faith prefiguring Luther 's 1529 three-part explanation of the Apostles ' Creed in the Small Catechism . Luther 's hymn , adapted and expanded from an earlier German creedal hymn , gained widespread use in vernacular Lutheran liturgies as early as 1525 . Sixteenth-century Lutheran hymnals also included " Wir glauben all " among the catechetical hymns , although 18th-century hymnals tended to label the hymn as Trinitarian rather than catechetical , and 20th-century Lutherans rarely use the hymn because of the perceived difficulty of its tune .
Several dozen radioisotopes have been characterized . 65Zn , which has a half-life of 243.66 days , is the most long-lived radioisotope , followed by 72Zn with a half-life of 46.5 hours . Zinc has 10 nuclear isomers . 69mZn has the longest half-life , 13.76 h. The superscript m indicates a metastable isotope . The nucleus of a metastable isotope is in an excited state and will return to the ground state by emitting a photon in the form of a gamma ray . 61Zn has three excited states and 73Zn has two . The isotopes 65Zn , 71Zn , 77Zn and 78Zn each have only one excited state .
As opposed to broadcasts of primetime series , CBS broadcast special episodes of its late night talk shows as its lead-out programs for Super Bowl 50 , beginning with a special episode of The Late Show with Stephen Colbert following the game . Following a break for late local programming , CBS also aired a special episode of The Late Late Show with James Corden .
For the first time , the Super Bowl 50 Host Committee and the NFL have openly sought disabled veteran and lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender-owned businesses in Business Connect , the Super Bowl program that provides local companies with contracting opportunities in and around the Super Bowl . The host committee has already raised over $ 40 million through sponsors including Apple , Google , Yahoo ! , Intel , Gap , Chevron , and Dignity Health .
In mid May 1967 , the Soviet Union issued warnings to Nasser of an impending Israeli attack on Syria . Although the chief of staff Mohamed Fawzi verified them as " baseless " , Nasser took three successive steps that made the war virtually inevitable : On 14 May he deployed his troops in Sinai near the border with Israel , on 19 May he expelled the UN peacekeepers stationed in the Sinai Peninsula border with Israel , and on 23 May he closed the Straits of Tiran to Israeli shipping . On 26 May Nasser declared , " The battle will be a general one and our basic objective will be to destroy Israel " .
The " Neo-Eriksonian " identity status paradigm emerged in later years [ when ? ] , driven largely by the work of James Marcia . This paradigm focuses upon the twin concepts of exploration and commitment . The central idea is that any individual 's sense of identity is determined in large part by the explorations and commitments that he or she makes regarding certain personal and social traits . It follows that the core of the research in this paradigm investigates the degrees to which a person has made certain explorations , and the degree to which he or she displays a commitment to those explorations .
Zinc metal is produced using extractive metallurgy . After grinding the ore , froth flotation , which selectively separates minerals from gangue by taking advantage of differences in their hydrophobicity , is used to get an ore concentrate . This concentrate consists of about 50 % zinc with the rest being sulfur ( 32 % ) , iron ( 13 % ) , and SiO 2 ( 5 % ) . The composition of this is normally zinc sulfide ( 80 % to 85 % ) , iron sulfide ( 7.0 % to 12 % ) , lead sulfide ( 3.0 % to 5.0 % ) silica ( 2.5 % to 3.5 % ) , and cadmium sulfide ( 0.35 % to 0.41 % ) .
In the United States , macabre-rock pioneer Alice Cooper achieved mainstream success with the top ten album School 's Out ( 1972 ) . In the following year blues rockers ZZ Top released their classic album Tres Hombres and Aerosmith produced their eponymous début , as did Southern rockers Lynyrd Skynyrd and proto-punk outfit New York Dolls , demonstrating the diverse directions being pursued in the genre . Montrose , including the instrumental talent of Ronnie Montrose and vocals of Sammy Hagar and arguably the first all American hard rock band to challenge the British dominance of the genre , released their first album in 1973 . Kiss built on the theatrics of Alice Cooper and the look of the New York Dolls to produce a unique band persona , achieving their commercial breakthrough with the double live album Alive ! in 1975 and helping to take hard rock into the stadium rock era . In the mid-1970s Aerosmith achieved their commercial and artistic breakthrough with Toys in the Attic ( 1975 ) , which reached number 11 in the American album chart , and Rocks ( 1976 ) , which peaked at number three . Blue Öyster Cult , formed in the late 60s , picked up on some of the elements introduced by Black Sabbath with their breakthrough live gold album On Your Feet or on Your Knees ( 1975 ) , followed by their first platinum album , Agents of Fortune ( 1976 ) , containing the hit single " ( Do n't Fear ) The Reaper " , which reached number 12 on the Billboard charts . Journey released their eponymous debut in 1975 and the next year Boston released their highly successful début album . In the same year , hard rock bands featuring women saw commercial success as Heart released Dreamboat Annie and The Runaways débuted with their self-titled album . While Heart had a more folk-oriented hard rock sound , the Runaways leaned more towards a mix of punk-influenced music and hard rock . The Amboy Dukes , having emerged from the Detroit garage rock scene and most famous for their Top 20 psychedelic hit " Journey to the Center of the Mind " ( 1968 ) , were dissolved by their guitarist Ted Nugent , who embarked on a solo career that resulted in four successive multi-platinum albums between Ted Nugent ( 1975 ) and his best selling Double Live Gonzo ( 1978 ) .
In the Late Empire and Middle Ages Vergilius was spelled Virgilius . Two explanations are commonly given for this alteration . One deduces a false etymology associated with the word virgo ( " maiden " in Latin ) due to Virgil 's excessive , " maiden " -like modesty . Alternatively , some argue that Vergilius was altered to Virgilius by analogy with the Latin virga ( " wand " ) due to the magical or prophetic powers attributed to Virgil in the Middle Ages ( this explanation is found in only a handful of manuscripts , however , and was probably not widespread ) . In Norman schools ( following the French practice ) , the habit was to anglicize Latin names by dropping their Latin endings , hence Virgil . In the 19th century , some German-trained classicists in the United States suggested modification to Vergil , as it is closer to his original name , and is also the traditional German spelling . [ citation needed ] Modern usage permits both , though the Oxford guide to style recommends Vergilius to avoid confusion with the 8th-century grammarian Virgilius Maro Grammaticus . Some post-Renaissance writers liked to affect the sobriquet " The Swan of Mantua " . [ citation needed ]
Luther sympathised with some of the peasants ' grievances , as he showed in his response to the Twelve Articles in May 1525 , but he reminded the aggrieved to obey the temporal authorities . During a tour of Thuringia , he became enraged at the widespread burning of convents , monasteries , bishops ' palaces , and libraries . In Against the Murderous , Thieving Hordes of Peasants , written on his return to Wittenberg , he gave his interpretation of the Gospel teaching on wealth , condemned the violence as the devil 's work , and called for the nobles to put down the rebels like mad dogs :
In the summer of 1521 , Luther widened his target from individual pieties like indulgences and pilgrimages to doctrines at the heart of Church practices . In On the Abrogation of the Private Mass , he condemned as idolatry the idea that the mass is a sacrifice , asserting instead that it is a gift , to be received with thanksgiving by the whole congregation . His essay On Confession , Whether the Pope has the Power to Require It rejected compulsory confession and encouraged private confession and absolution , since " every Christian is a confessor . " In November , Luther wrote The Judgement of Martin Luther on Monastic Vows . He assured monks and nuns that they could break their vows without sin , because vows were an illegitimate and vain attempt to win salvation .
Samuel Adelstein described the Lombardi mandolin in 1893 as wider and shorter than the Neapolitan mandolin , with a shallower back and a shorter and wider neck , with six single strings to the regular mandolin 's set of 4 . The Lombardi was tuned C , D , A , E , B , G. The strings were fastened to the bridge like a guitar 's . There were 20 frets , covering three octaves , with an additional 5 notes . When Adelstein wrote , there were no nylon strings , and the gut and single strings " do not vibrate so clearly and sweetly as the double steel string of the Neapolitan . "
Though Brazilians of at least partial African heritage make up a large percentage of the population , few blacks have been elected as politicians . The city of Salvador , Bahia , for instance , is 80 % people of color , but voters have not elected a mayor of color . Journalists like to say that US cities with black majorities , such as Detroit and New Orleans , have not elected white mayors since after the civil rights movement , when the Voting Rights Act of 1965 protected the franchise for minorities , and blacks in the South regained the power to vote for the first time since the turn of the 20th century . New Orleans elected its first black mayor in the 1970s . New Orleans elected a white mayor after the widescale disruption and damage of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 .
Luther 's final journey , to Mansfeld , was taken because of his concern for his siblings ' families continuing in their father Hans Luther 's copper mining trade . Their livelihood was threatened by Count Albrecht of Mansfeld bringing the industry under his own control . The controversy that ensued involved all four Mansfeld counts : Albrecht , Philip , John George , and Gerhard . Luther journeyed to Mansfeld twice in late 1545 to participate in the negotiations for a settlement , and a third visit was needed in early 1546 for their completion .
The etymology of the name Bern is uncertain . According to the local legend , based on folk etymology , Berchtold V , Duke of Zähringen , the founder of the city of Bern , vowed to name the city after the first animal he met on the hunt , and this turned out to be a bear . It has long been considered likely that the city was named after the Italian city of Verona , which at the time was known as Bern in Middle High German . As a result of the find of the Bern zinc tablet in the 1980s , it is now more common to assume that the city was named after a pre-existing toponym of Celtic origin , possibly *berna " cleft " . The bear was the heraldic animal of the seal and coat of arms of Bern from at least the 1220s . The earliest reference to the keeping of live bears in the Bärengraben dates to the 1440s .
In late November 2015 , reports surfaced stating that " multiple acts " would perform during the halftime show . On December 3 , the league confirmed that the show would be headlined by the British rock group Coldplay . On January 7 , 2016 , Pepsi confirmed to the Associated Press that Beyoncé , who headlined the Super Bowl XLVII halftime show and collaborated with Coldplay on the single " Hymn for the Weekend " , would be making an appearance . Bruno Mars , who headlined the Super Bowl XLVIII halftime show , and Mark Ronson also performed .

Cardinal priests are the most numerous of the three orders of cardinals in the Catholic Church , ranking above the cardinal deacons and below the cardinal bishops . Those who are named cardinal priests today are generally bishops of important dioceses throughout the world , though some hold Curial positions .
Bern was the site of the 1954 Football ( Soccer ) World Cup Final , a huge upset for the Hungarian Golden Team , who were beaten 3–2 by West Germany . The football team BSC Young Boys is based in Bern at the Stade de Suisse Wankdorf , which also was one of the venues for the European football championship 2008 in which it hosted 3 matches .
It includes the entire Old Town , which is also a UNESCO World Heritage Site , and many sites within and around it . Some of the most notable in the Old Town include the Cathedral which was started in 1421 and is the tallest cathedral in Switzerland , the Zytglogge and Käfigturm towers , which mark two successive expansions of the Old Town , and the Holy Ghost Church , which is one of the largest Swiss Reformed churches in Switzerland . Within the Old Town , there are eleven 16th century fountains , most attributed to Hans Gieng , that are on the list .
In cities other than Rome , the name cardinal began to be applied to certain church men as a mark of honour . The earliest example of this occurs in a letter sent by Pope Zacharias in 747 to Pippin III ( the Short ) , ruler of the Franks , in which Zacharias applied the title to the priests of Paris to distinguish them from country clergy . This meaning of the word spread rapidly , and from the 9th century various episcopal cities had a special class among the clergy known as cardinals . The use of the title was reserved for the cardinals of Rome in 1567 by Pius V .
The term " Moors " has been used in Europe in a broader , somewhat derogatory sense to refer to Muslims , especially those of Arab or Berber descent , whether living in North Africa or Iberia . Moors were not a distinct or self-defined people . Medieval and early modern Europeans applied the name to Muslim Arabs , Berbers , Black Africans and Europeans alike .
On 15 June 1520 , the Pope warned Luther with the papal bull ( edict ) Exsurge Domine that he risked excommunication unless he recanted 41 sentences drawn from his writings , including the 95 Theses , within 60 days . That autumn , Johann Eck proclaimed the bull in Meissen and other towns . Karl von Miltitz , a papal nuncio , attempted to broker a solution , but Luther , who had sent the Pope a copy of On the Freedom of a Christian in October , publicly set fire to the bull and decretals at Wittenberg on 10 December 1520 , an act he defended in Why the Pope and his Recent Book are Burned and Assertions Concerning All Articles . As a consequence , Luther was excommunicated by Pope Leo X on 3 January 1521 , in the bull Decet Romanum Pontificem .

The Suez Canal , built in partnership with the French , was completed in 1869 . Its construction led to enormous debt to European banks , and caused popular discontent because of the onerous taxation it required . In 1875 Ismail was forced to sell Egypt 's share in the canal to the British Government . Within three years this led to the imposition of British and French controllers who sat in the Egyptian cabinet , and , " with the financial power of the bondholders behind them , were the real power in the Government . "
Prior to the Golden Age of Mandolins , France had a history with the mandolin , with mandolinists playing in Paris until the Napoleonic Wars . The players , teachers and composers included Giovanni Fouchetti , Eduardo Mezzacapo , Gabriele Leon , and Gervasio . During the Golden age itself ( 1880s-1920s ) , the mandolin had a strong presence in France . Prominent mandolin players or composers included Jules Cottin and his sister Madeleine Cottin , Jean Pietrapertosa , and Edgar Bara . Paris had dozens of " estudiantina " mandolin orchestras in the early 1900s . Mandolin magazines included L'Estudiantina , Le Plectre , École de la mandolie .
The game 's media day , which was typically held on the Tuesday afternoon prior to the game , was moved to the Monday evening and re-branded as Super Bowl Opening Night . The event was held on February 1 , 2016 at SAP Center in San Jose . Alongside the traditional media availabilities , the event featured an opening ceremony with player introductions on a replica of the Golden Gate Bridge .
Political and economic relations were drastically influenced by these theories as the concept of the guild was subordinated to the theory of free trade , and Roman Catholic dominance of theology was increasingly challenged by Protestant churches subordinate to each nation-state , which also ( in a fashion the Roman Catholic Church often decried angrily ) preached in the vulgar or native language of each region . However , the enlightenment was an outright attack on religion , particularly Christianity . The most outspoken critic of the church in France was François Marie Arouet de Voltaire , a representative figure of the enlightenment . After Voltaire , religion would never be the same again in France .
It is admitted that the doctrine as defined by Pius IX was not explicitly mooted before the 12th century . It is also agreed that " no direct or categorical and stringent proof of the dogma can be brought forward from Scripture " . But it is claimed that the doctrine is implicitly contained in the teaching of the Fathers . Their expressions on the subject of the sinlessness of Mary are , it is pointed out , so ample and so absolute that they must be taken to include original sin as well as actual . Thus in the first five centuries such epithets as " in every respect holy " , " in all things unstained " , " super-innocent " , and " singularly holy " are applied to her ; she is compared to Eve before the fall , as ancestress of a redeemed people ; she is " the earth before it was accursed " . The well-known words of St. Augustine ( d. 430 ) may be cited : " As regards the mother of God , " he says , " I will not allow any question whatever of sin . " It is true that he is here speaking directly of actual or personal sin . But his argument is that all men are sinners ; that they are so through original depravity ; that this original depravity may be overcome by the grace of God , and he adds that he does not know but that Mary may have had sufficient grace to overcome sin " of every sort " ( omni ex parte ) .
Most of Egypt 's rain falls in the winter months . South of Cairo , rainfall averages only around 2 to 5 mm ( 0.1 to 0.2 in ) per year and at intervals of many years . On a very thin strip of the northern coast the rainfall can be as high as 410 mm ( 16.1 in ) , mostly between October and March . Snow falls on Sinai 's mountains and some of the north coastal cities such as Damietta , Baltim , Sidi Barrany , etc . and rarely in Alexandria . A very small amount of snow fell on Cairo on 13 December 2013 , the first time Cairo received snowfall in many decades . Frost is also known in mid-Sinai and mid-Egypt . Egypt is the driest and the sunniest country in the world , and most of its land surface is desert .
CBS set the base rate for a 30-second advertisement at $ 5,000,000 , a record high price for a Super Bowl ad . As of January 26 , the advertisements had not yet sold out . CBS mandated that all advertisers purchase a package covering time on both the television and digital broadcasts of the game , meaning that for the first time , digital streams of the game would carry all national advertising in pattern with the television broadcast . This would be the final year in a multi-year contract with Anheuser-Busch InBev that allowed the beer manufacturer to air multiple advertisements during the game at a steep discount . It was also the final year that Doritos , a longtime sponsor of the game , held its " Crash the Super Bowl " contest that allowed viewers to create their own Doritos ads for a chance to have it aired during the game . Nintendo and The Pokémon Company also made their Super Bowl debut , promoting the 20th anniversary of the Pokémon video game and media franchise .
In 2007 , BSkyB and Virgin Media became involved in a dispute over the carriage of Sky channels on cable TV . The failure to renew the existing carriage agreements negotiated with NTL and Telewest resulted in Virgin Media removing the basic channels from the network on 1 March 2007 . Virgin Media claimed that BSkyB had substantially increased the asking price for the channels , a claim which BSkyB denied , on the basis that their new deal offered " substantially more value " by including HD channels and Video On Demand content which was not previously carried by cable .
On June 4 , 2014 , the NFL announced that the practice of branding Super Bowl games with Roman numerals , a practice established at Super Bowl V , would be temporarily suspended , and that the game would be named using Arabic numerals as Super Bowl 50 as opposed to Super Bowl L. The use of Roman numerals will be reinstated for Super Bowl LI . Jaime Weston , the league 's vice president of brand and creative , explained that a primary reason for the change was the difficulty of designing an aesthetically pleasing logo with the letter " L " using the standardized logo template introduced at Super Bowl XLV . The logo also deviates from the template by featuring large numerals , colored in gold , behind the Vince Lombardi Trophy , instead of underneath and in silver as in the standard logo .
Zinc is a bluish-white , lustrous , diamagnetic metal , though most common commercial grades of the metal have a dull finish . It is somewhat less dense than iron and has a hexagonal crystal structure , with a distorted form of hexagonal close packing , in which each atom has six nearest neighbors ( at 265.9 pm ) in its own plane and six others at a greater distance of 290.6 pm . The metal is hard and brittle at most temperatures but becomes malleable between 100 and 150 °C . Above 210 °C , the metal becomes brittle again and can be pulverized by beating . Zinc is a fair conductor of electricity . For a metal , zinc has relatively low melting ( 419.5 °C ) and boiling points ( 907 °C ) . Its melting point is the lowest of all the transition metals aside from mercury and cadmium .
In July 2013 , the English High Court of Justice found that Microsoft ’ s use of the term " SkyDrive " infringed on Sky ’ s right to the " Sky " trademark . On 31 July 2013 , BSkyB and Microsoft announced their settlement , in which Microsoft will not appeal the ruling , and will rename its SkyDrive cloud storage service after an unspecified " reasonable period of time to allow for an orderly transition to a new brand , " plus " financial and other terms , the details of which are confidential " . On 27 January 2014 , Microsoft announced " that SkyDrive will soon become OneDrive " and " SkyDrive Pro " becomes " OneDrive for Business " .
The U.S. census race definitions says a " black " is a person having origins in any of the black ( sub-Saharan ) racial groups of Africa . It includes people who indicate their race as " Black , African Am. , or Negro " or who provide written entries such as African American , Afro-American , Kenyan , Nigerian , or Haitian . The Census Bureau notes that these classifications are socio-political constructs and should not be interpreted as scientific or anthropological . Most African Americans also have European ancestry in varying amounts ; a lesser proportion have some Native American ancestry . For instance , genetic studies of African Americans show an ancestry that is on average 17–18 % European .
This nationwide acceptance and recognition of Aboriginal people led to a significant increase in the number of people self-identifying as Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander . The reappropriation of the term " black " with a positive and more inclusive meaning has resulted in its widespread use in mainstream Australian culture , including public media outlets , government agencies , and private companies . In 2012 , a number of high-profile cases highlighted the legal and community attitude that identifying as Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander is not dependent on skin colour , with a well-known boxer Anthony Mundine being widely criticised for questioning the " blackness " of another boxer and journalist Andrew Bolt being successfully sued for publishing discriminatory comments about Aboriginals with light skin .
The Romans interacted with and later conquered parts of Mauretania , an early state that covered modern Morocco , western Algeria , and the Spanish cities Ceuta and Melilla during the classical period . The people of the region were noted in Classical literature as Mauri , which was subsequently rendered as Moors in English .
A few hard rock bands from the 1970s and 1980s managed to sustain highly successful recording careers . Bon Jovi were still able to achieve a commercial hit with " It 's My Life " from their double platinum-certified album Crush ( 2000 ) . and AC/DC released the platinum-certified Stiff Upper Lip ( 2000 ) Aerosmith released a number two platinum album , Just Push Play ( 2001 ) , which saw the band foray further into pop with the Top 10 hit " Jaded " , and a blues cover album , Honkin ' on Bobo , which reached number five in 2004 . Heart achieved their first Top 10 album since the early 90s with Red Velvet Car in 2010 , becoming the first female-led hard rock band to earn Top 10 albums spanning five decades . There were reunions and subsequent tours from Van Halen ( with Hagar in 2004 and then Roth in 2007 ) , The Who ( delayed in 2002 by the death of bassist John Entwistle until 2006 ) and Black Sabbath ( with Osbourne 1997–2006 and Dio 2006–2010 ) and even a one off performance by Led Zeppelin ( 2007 ) , renewing the interest in previous eras . Additionally , hard rock supergroups , such as Audioslave ( with former members of Rage Against the Machine and Soundgarden ) and Velvet Revolver ( with former members of Guns N ' Roses , punk band Wasted Youth and Stone Temple Pilots singer Scott Weiland ) , emerged and experienced some success . However , these bands were short-lived , ending in 2007 and 2008 , respectively . The long awaited Guns N ' Roses album Chinese Democracy was finally released in 2008 , but only went platinum and failed to come close to the success of the band 's late 1980s and early 1990s material . More successfully , AC/DC released the double platinum-certified Black Ice ( 2008 ) . Bon Jovi continued to enjoy success , branching into country music with " Who Says You Ca n't Go Home " , which reached number one on the Hot Country Singles chart in 2006 , and the rock/country album Lost Highway , which reached number one in 2007 . In 2009 , Bon Jovi released another number one album , The Circle , which marked a return to their hard rock sound .

Most of Egypt 's rain falls in the winter months . South of Cairo , rainfall averages only around 2 to 5 mm ( 0.1 to 0.2 in ) per year and at intervals of many years . On a very thin strip of the northern coast the rainfall can be as high as 410 mm ( 16.1 in ) , mostly between October and March . Snow falls on Sinai 's mountains and some of the north coastal cities such as Damietta , Baltim , Sidi Barrany , etc . and rarely in Alexandria . A very small amount of snow fell on Cairo on 13 December 2013 , the first time Cairo received snowfall in many decades . Frost is also known in mid-Sinai and mid-Egypt . Egypt is the driest and the sunniest country in the world , and most of its land surface is desert .
According to the tradition , Virgil traveled to Greece in about 19 BC to revise the Aeneid . After meeting Augustus in Athens and deciding to return home , Virgil caught a fever while visiting a town near Megara . After crossing to Italy by ship , weakened with disease , Virgil died in Brundisium harbor on September 21 , 19 BC . Augustus ordered Virgil 's literary executors , Lucius Varius Rufus and Plotius Tucca , to disregard Virgil 's own wish that the poem be burned , instead ordering it published with as few editorial changes as possible . As a result , the text of the Aeneid that exists may contain faults which Virgil was planning to correct before publication . However , the only obvious imperfections are a few lines of verse that are metrically unfinished ( i.e . not a complete line of dactylic hexameter ) . Some scholars have argued that Virgil deliberately left these metrically incomplete lines for dramatic effect . Other alleged imperfections are subject to scholarly debate .
Although Foo Fighters continued to be one of the most successful rock acts , with albums like In Your Honor ( 2005 ) reaching number two in the US and UK , many of the first wave of post-grunge bands began to fade in popularity . Acts like Creed , Staind , Puddle of Mudd and Nickelback took the genre into the 2000s with considerable commercial success , abandoning most of the angst and anger of the original movement for more conventional anthems , narratives and romantic songs . They were followed in this vein by new acts including Shinedown and Seether . Acts with more conventional hard rock sounds included Andrew W.K. , Beautiful Creatures and Buckcherry , whose breakthrough album 15 ( 2006 ) went platinum and spawned the single " Sorry " ( 2007 ) , which made the Top 10 of the Billboard 100 . These were joined by bands with hard rock leanings that emerged in the mid-2000s from the garage rock or post punk revival , including Black Rebel Motorcycle Club and Kings of Leon , and Queens of the Stone Age from the US , Three Days Grace from Canada , Jet from Australia and The Datsuns from New Zealand . In 2009 Them Crooked Vultures , a supergroup that brought together Foo Fighters ' Dave Grohl , Queens of the Stone Age 's Josh Homme and Led Zeppelin bass player John Paul Jones attracted attention as a live act and released a self-titled debut album that reached the top 20 in the US and UK and the top ten in several other countries .
Super Bowl 50 featured numerous records from individuals and teams . Denver won despite being massively outgained in total yards ( 315 to 194 ) and first downs ( 21 to 11 ) . Their 194 yards and 11 first downs were both the lowest totals ever by a Super Bowl winning team . The previous record was 244 yards by the Baltimore Ravens in Super Bowl XXXV . Only seven other teams had ever gained less than 200 yards in a Super Bowl , and all of them had lost . The Broncos ' seven sacks tied a Super Bowl record set by the Chicago Bears in Super Bowl XX . Kony Ealy tied a Super Bowl record with three sacks . Jordan Norwood 's 61-yard punt return set a new record , surpassing the old record of 45 yards set by John Taylor in Super Bowl XXIII . Denver was just 1-of-14 on third down , while Carolina was barely better at 3-of-15 . The two teams ' combined third down conversion percentage of 13.8 was a Super Bowl low . Manning and Newton had quarterback passer ratings of 56.6 and 55.4 , respectively , and their added total of 112 is a record lowest aggregate passer rating for a Super Bowl . Manning became the oldest quarterback ever to win a Super Bowl at age 39 , and the first quarterback ever to win a Super Bowl with two different teams , while Gary Kubiak became the first head coach to win a Super Bowl with the same franchise he went to the Super Bowl with as a player .
Sony renamed the record company Sony Music Entertainment ( SME ) on January 1 , 1991 , fulfilling the terms set under the 1988 buyout , which granted only a transitional license to the CBS trademark . The CBS Associated label was renamed Epic Associated . Also on January 1 , 1991 , to replace the CBS label , Sony reintroduced the Columbia label worldwide , which it previously held in the United States and Canada only , after it acquired the international rights to the trademark from EMI in 1990 . Japan is the only country where Sony does not have rights to the Columbia name as it is controlled by Nippon Columbia , an unrelated company . Thus , until this day , Sony Music Entertainment Japan does not use the Columbia trademark for Columbia label recordings from outside Japan which are issued in Japan . The Columbia Records trademark 's rightsholder in Spain was Bertelsmann Music Group , Germany , which Sony Music subsequently subsumed via a 2004 merger , followed by a 2008 buyout .
The annual NFL Experience was held at the Moscone Center in San Francisco . In addition , " Super Bowl City " opened on January 30 at Justin Herman Plaza on The Embarcadero , featuring games and activities that will highlight the Bay Area 's technology , culinary creations , and cultural diversity . More than 1 million people are expected to attend the festivities in San Francisco during Super Bowl Week . San Francisco mayor Ed Lee said of the highly visible homeless presence in this area " they are going to have to leave " . San Francisco city supervisor Jane Kim unsuccessfully lobbied for the NFL to reimburse San Francisco for city services in the amount of $ 5 million .
In October 1529 , Philip I , Landgrave of Hesse , convoked an assembly of German and Swiss theologians at the Marburg Colloquy , to establish doctrinal unity in the emerging Protestant states . Agreement was achieved on fourteen points out of fifteen , the exception being the nature of the Eucharist – the sacrament of the Lord 's Supper—an issue crucial to Luther .
Egypt ( i/ˈiːdʒɪpt/ ; Arabic : مِصر‎ Miṣr , Egyptian Arabic : مَصر Maṣr , Coptic : Ⲭⲏⲙⲓ Khemi ) , officially the Arab Republic of Egypt , is a transcontinental country spanning the northeast corner of Africa and southwest corner of Asia , via a land bridge formed by the Sinai Peninsula . It is the world 's only contiguous Eurafrasian nation . Most of Egypt 's territory of 1,010,408 square kilometres ( 390,000 sq mi ) lies within the Nile Valley . Egypt is a Mediterranean country . It is bordered by the Gaza Strip and Israel to the northeast , the Gulf of Aqaba to the east , the Red Sea to the east and south , Sudan to the south and Libya to the west .
Luther 's hymns were frequently evoked by particular events in his life and the unfolding Reformation . This behavior started with his learning of the execution of Johann Esch and Heinrich Voes , the first individuals to be martyred by the Roman Catholic Church for Lutheran views , prompting Luther to write the hymn " Ein neues Lied wir heben an " ( " A new song we raise " ) , which is generally known in English by John C. Messenger 's translation by the title and first line " Flung to the Heedless Winds " and sung to the tune Ibstone composed in 1875 by Maria C. Tiddeman .
Following the 1973 war and the subsequent peace treaty , Egypt became the first Arab nation to establish diplomatic relations with Israel . Despite that , Israel is still widely considered as a hostile state by the majority of Egyptians . Egypt has played a historical role as a mediator in resolving various disputes in the Middle East , most notably its handling of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the peace process . Egypt 's ceasefire and truce brokering efforts in Gaza have hardly been challenged following Israel 's evacuation of its settlements from the strip in 2005 , despite increasing animosity towards the Hamas government in Gaza following the ouster of Mohamed Morsi , and despite recent attempts by countries like Turkey and Qatar to take over this role .
There are many styles of mandolin , but four are common , the Neapolitan or round-backed mandolin , the carved-top mandolin and the flat-backed mandolin . The round-back has a deep bottom , constructed of strips of wood , glued together into a bowl . The carved-top or arch-top mandolin has a much shallower , arched back , and an arched top—both carved out of wood . The flat-backed mandolin uses thin sheets of wood for the body , braced on the inside for strength in a similar manner to a guitar . Each style of instrument has its own sound quality and is associated with particular forms of music . Neapolitan mandolins feature prominently in European classical music and traditional music . Carved-top instruments are common in American folk music and bluegrass music . Flat-backed instruments are commonly used in Irish , British and Brazilian folk music . Some modern Brazilian instruments feature an extra fifth course tuned a fifth lower than the standard fourth course .
Bern was the site of the 1954 Football ( Soccer ) World Cup Final , a huge upset for the Hungarian Golden Team , who were beaten 3–2 by West Germany . The football team BSC Young Boys is based in Bern at the Stade de Suisse Wankdorf , which also was one of the venues for the European football championship 2008 in which it hosted 3 matches .
In 1542 , Luther read a Latin translation of the Qur'an . He went on to produce several critical pamphlets on Islam , which he called " Mohammedanism " or " the Turk " . Though Luther saw the Muslim faith as a tool of the devil , he was indifferent to its practice : " Let the Turk believe and live as he will , just as one lets the papacy and other false Christians live . " He opposed banning the publication of the Qur'an , wanting it exposed to scrutiny .
Egypt 's most prominent multinational companies are the Orascom Group and Raya Contact Center . The information technology ( IT ) sector has expanded rapidly in the past few years , with many start-ups selling outsourcing services to North America and Europe , operating with companies such as Microsoft , Oracle and other major corporations , as well as many small and medium size enterprises . Some of these companies are the Xceed Contact Center , Raya , E Group Connections and C3 . The IT sector has been stimulated by new Egyptian entrepreneurs with government encouragement .

BSkyB 's direct-to-home satellite service became available in 10 million homes in 2010 , Europe 's first pay-TV platform in to achieve that milestone . Confirming it had reached its target , the broadcaster said its reach into 36 % of households in the UK represented an audience of more than 25m people . The target was first announced in August 2004 , since then an additional 2.4m customers had subscribed to BSkyB 's direct-to-home service . Media commentators had debated whether the figure could be reached as the growth in subscriber numbers elsewhere in Europe flattened .
The Federal Palace ( Bundeshaus ) , built from 1857 to 1902 , which houses the national parliament , government and part of the federal administration , can also be visited .
Other sources include fortified food and dietary supplements , which come in various forms . A 1998 review concluded that zinc oxide , one of the most common supplements in the United States , and zinc carbonate are nearly insoluble and poorly absorbed in the body . This review cited studies which found low plasma zinc concentrations after zinc oxide and zinc carbonate were consumed compared with those seen after consumption of zinc acetate and sulfate salts . However , harmful excessive supplementation is a problem among the relatively affluent , and should probably not exceed 20 mg/day in healthy people , although the U.S. National Research Council set a Tolerable Upper Intake of 40 mg/day .
In honor of the 50th Super Bowl , the pregame ceremony featured the on-field introduction of 39 of the 43 previous Super Bowl Most Valuable Players . Bart Starr ( MVP of Super Bowls I and II ) and Chuck Howley ( MVP of Super Bowl V ) appeared via video , while Peyton Manning ( MVP of Super Bowl XLI and current Broncos quarterback ) was shown in the locker room preparing for the game . No plans were announced regarding the recognition of Harvey Martin , co-MVP of Super Bowl XII , who died in 2001 .

Formed in November 1990 by the equal merger of Sky Television and British Satellite Broadcasting , BSkyB became the UK 's largest digital subscription television company . Following BSkyB 's 2014 acquisition of Sky Italia and a majority 90.04 % interest in Sky Deutschland in November 2014 , its holding company British Sky Broadcasting Group plc changed its name to Sky plc . The United Kingdom operations also changed the company name from British Sky Broadcasting Limited to Sky UK Limited , still trading as Sky .
The Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life ranks Egypt as the fifth worst country in the world for religious freedom . The United States Commission on International Religious Freedom , a bipartisan independent agency of the US government , has placed Egypt on its watch list of countries that require close monitoring due to the nature and extent of violations of religious freedom engaged in or tolerated by the government . According to a 2010 Pew Global Attitudes survey , 84 % of Egyptians polled supported the death penalty for those who leave Islam ; 77 % supported whippings and cutting off of hands for theft and robbery ; and 82 % support stoning a person who commits adultery .
Luther next set about reversing or modifying the new church practices . By working alongside the authorities to restore public order , he signalled his reinvention as a conservative force within the Reformation . After banishing the Zwickau prophets , he now faced a battle against not only the established Church but also the radical reformers who threatened the new order by fomenting social unrest and violence .
Luther came to understand justification as entirely the work of God . This teaching by Luther was clearly expressed in his 1525 publication On the Bondage of the Will , which was written in response to On Free Will by Desiderius Erasmus ( 1524 ) . Luther based his position on predestination on St. Paul 's epistle to the Ephesians 2:8–10 . Against the teaching of his day that the righteous acts of believers are performed in cooperation with God , Luther wrote that Christians receive such righteousness entirely from outside themselves ; that righteousness not only comes from Christ but actually is the righteousness of Christ , imputed to Christians ( rather than infused into them ) through faith . " That is why faith alone makes someone just and fulfills the law , " he wrote . " Faith is that which brings the Holy Spirit through the merits of Christ . " Faith , for Luther , was a gift from God ; the experience of being justified by faith was " as though I had been born again . " His entry into Paradise , no less , was a discovery about " the righteousness of God " – a discovery that " the just person " of whom the Bible speaks ( as in Romans 1:17 ) lives by faith . He explained his concept of " justification " in the Smalcald Articles :

Luther 's disappearance during his return trip back to Wittenberg was planned . Frederick III had him intercepted on his way home in the forest near Wittenberg by masked horsemen who were made to appear as armed highwaymen . They escorted Luther to the security of the Wartburg Castle at Eisenach . During his stay at Wartburg , which he referred to as " my Patmos " , Luther translated the New Testament from Greek into German and poured out doctrinal and polemical writings . These included a renewed attack on Archbishop Albrecht of Mainz , whom he shamed into halting the sale of indulgences in his episcopates , and a " Refutation of the Argument of Latomus , " in which he expounded the principle of justification to Jacobus Latomus , an orthodox theologian from Louvain .
The concept of blackness in the United States has been described as the degree to which one associates themselves with mainstream African-American culture , politics , and values . To a certain extent , this concept is not so much about race but more about political orientation , culture and behavior . Blackness can be contrasted with " acting white " , where black Americans are said to behave with assumed characteristics of stereotypical white Americans with regard to fashion , dialect , taste in music , and possibly , from the perspective of a significant number of black youth , academic achievement .
The description or representation of individual and group identity is a central task for psychologists , sociologists and anthropologists and those of other disciplines where " identity " needs to be mapped and defined . How should one describe the identity of another , in ways which encompass both their idiosyncratic qualities and their group memberships or identifications , both of which can shift according to circumstance ? Following on from the work of Kelly , Erikson , Tajfel and others Weinreich 's Identity Structure Analysis ( ISA ) , is " a structural representation of the individual 's existential experience , in which the relationships between self and other agents are organised in relatively stable structures over time … with the emphasis on the socio-cultural milieu in which self relates to other agents and institutions " ( Weinreich and Saunderson , ( eds ) 2003 , p1 ) . Using constructs drawn from the salient discourses of the individual , the group and cultural norms , the practical operationalisation of ISA provides a methodology that maps how these are used by the individual , applied across time and milieus by the " situated self " to appraise self and other agents and institutions ( for example , resulting in the individual 's evaluation of self and significant others and institutions ) .

During the apartheid era , those classed as " Coloured " were oppressed and discriminated against . But , they had limited rights and overall had slightly better socioeconomic conditions than those classed as " Black " . The government required that Blacks and Coloureds live in areas separate from Whites , creating large townships located away from the cities as areas for Blacks .
By about 6000 BC , a Neolithic culture rooted in the Nile Valley . During the Neolithic era , several predynastic cultures developed independently in Upper and Lower Egypt . The Badarian culture and the successor Naqada series are generally regarded as precursors to dynastic Egypt . The earliest known Lower Egyptian site , Merimda , predates the Badarian by about seven hundred years . Contemporaneous Lower Egyptian communities coexisted with their southern counterparts for more than two thousand years , remaining culturally distinct , but maintaining frequent contact through trade . The earliest known evidence of Egyptian hieroglyphic inscriptions appeared during the predynastic period on Naqada III pottery vessels , dated to about 3200 BC .
As African states became independent in the 1960s , the Soviet Union offered many of their citizens the chance to study in Russia . Over a period of 40 years , about 400,000 African students from various countries moved to Russia to pursue higher studies , including many Black Africans . This extended beyond the Soviet Union to many countries of the Eastern bloc .
However , according to then-Secretary of State Colin Powell , the UNFPA contributed vehicles and computers to the Chinese to carry out their population control policies . However , both the Washington Post and the Washington Times reported that Powell simply fell in line , signing a brief written by someone else .
When Cowan Powers and his family recorded their old-time music from 1924-1926 , his daughter Orpha Powers was one of the earliest known southern-music artists to record with the mandolin . By the 1930s , single mandolins were becoming more commonly used in southern string band music , most notably by brother duets such as the sedate Blue Sky Boys ( Bill Bolick and Earl Bolick ) and the more hard-driving Monroe Brothers ( Bill Monroe and Charlie Monroe ) . However , the mandolin 's modern popularity in country music can be directly traced to one man : Bill Monroe , the father of bluegrass music . After the Monroe Brothers broke up in 1939 , Bill Monroe formed his own group , after a brief time called the Blue Grass Boys , and completed the transition of mandolin styles from a " parlor " sound typical of brother duets to the modern " bluegrass " style . He joined the Grand Ole Opry in 1939 and its powerful clear-channel broadcast signal on WSM-AM spread his style throughout the South , directly inspiring many musicians to take up the mandolin . Monroe famously played Gibson F-5 mandolin , signed and dated July 9 , 1923 , by Lloyd Loar , chief acoustic engineer at Gibson . The F-5 has since become the most imitated tonally and aesthetically by modern builders .
For the first time , the Super Bowl 50 Host Committee and the NFL have openly sought disabled veteran and lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender-owned businesses in Business Connect , the Super Bowl program that provides local companies with contracting opportunities in and around the Super Bowl . The host committee has already raised over $ 40 million through sponsors including Apple , Google , Yahoo ! , Intel , Gap , Chevron , and Dignity Health .
There are seven suburbicarian sees : Ostia , Albano , Porto and Santa Rufina , Palestrina , Sabina and Mentana , Frascati and Velletri . Velletri was united with Ostia from 1150 until 1914 , when Pope Pius X separated them again , but decreed that whatever cardinal bishop became Dean of the College of Cardinals would keep the suburbicarian see he already held , adding to it that of Ostia , with the result that there continued to be only six cardinal bishops .

Mandolin awareness in the United States blossomed in the 1880s , as the instrument became part of a fad that continued into the mid-1920s . According to Clarence L. Partee , the first mandolin made in the United States was made in 1883 or 1884 by Joseph Bohmann , who was an established maker of violins in Chicago . Partee characterized the early instrument as being larger than the European instruments he was used to , with a " peculiar shape " and " crude construction , " and said that the quality improved , until American instruments were " superior " to imported instruments . At the time , Partee was using an imported French-made mandolin .
On 18 January 2014 , the interim government successfully institutionalised a more secular constitution . The president is elected to a four-year term and may serve 2 terms . The parliament may impeach the president . Under the constitution , there is a guarantee of gender equality and absolute freedom of thought . The military retains the ability to appoint the national Minister of Defence for the next 8 years . Under the constitution , political parties may not be based on " religion , race , gender or geography " .
In 1988 , the civil rights leader Jesse Jackson urged Americans to use instead the term " African American " because it had a historical cultural base and was a construction similar to terms used by European descendants , such as German American , Italian American , etc . Since then , African American and black have often had parallel status . However , controversy continues over which if any of the two terms is more appropriate . Maulana Karenga argues that the term African-American is more appropriate because it accurately articulates their geographical and historical origin . [ citation needed ] Others have argued that " black " is a better term because " African " suggests foreignness , although Black Americans helped found the United States . Still others believe that the term black is inaccurate because African Americans have a variety of skin tones . Some surveys suggest that the majority of Black Americans have no preference for " African American " or " Black " , although they have a slight preference for " black " in personal settings and " African American " in more formal settings .

The legend of Virgil in his Basket arose in the Middle Ages , and is often seen in art and mentioned in literature as part of the Power of Women literary topos , demonstrating the disruptive force of female attractiveness on men . In this story Virgil became enamoured of a beautiful woman , sometimes described as the emperor 's daughter or mistress and called Lucretia . She played him along and agreed to an assignation at her house , which he was to sneak into at night by climbing into a large basket let down from a window . When he did so he was only hoisted halfway up the wall and then left him trapped there into the next day , exposed to public ridicule . The story paralleled that of Phyllis riding Aristotle . Among other artists depicting the scene , Lucas van Leyden made a woodcut and later an engraving .
In accordance with his father 's wishes , Luther enrolled in law school at the same university that year but dropped out almost immediately , believing that law represented uncertainty . Luther sought assurances about life and was drawn to theology and philosophy , expressing particular interest in Aristotle , William of Ockham , and Gabriel Biel . He was deeply influenced by two tutors , Bartholomaeus Arnoldi von Usingen and Jodocus Trutfetter , who taught him to be suspicious of even the greatest thinkers and to test everything himself by experience . Philosophy proved to be unsatisfying , offering assurance about the use of reason but none about loving God , which to Luther was more important . Reason could not lead men to God , he felt , and he thereafter developed a love-hate relationship with Aristotle over the latter 's emphasis on reason . For Luther , reason could be used to question men and institutions , but not God . Human beings could learn about God only through divine revelation , he believed , and Scripture therefore became increasingly important to him .
The element was probably named by the alchemist Paracelsus after the German word Zinke ( prong , tooth ) . German chemist Andreas Sigismund Marggraf is credited with discovering pure metallic zinc in 1746 . Work by Luigi Galvani and Alessandro Volta uncovered the electrochemical properties of zinc by 1800 . Corrosion-resistant zinc plating of iron ( hot-dip galvanizing ) is the major application for zinc . Other applications are in batteries , small non-structural castings , and alloys , such as brass . A variety of zinc compounds are commonly used , such as zinc carbonate and zinc gluconate ( as dietary supplements ) , zinc chloride ( in deodorants ) , zinc pyrithione ( anti-dandruff shampoos ) , zinc sulfide ( in luminescent paints ) , and zinc methyl or zinc diethyl in the organic laboratory .
Egyptian President Anwar Sadat had a mother who was a dark-skinned Nubian Sudanese woman and a father who was a lighter-skinned Egyptian . In response to an advertisement for an acting position , as a young man he said , " I am not white but I am not exactly black either . My blackness is tending to reddish " .
Critics of the Aeneid focus on a variety of issues . The tone of the poem as a whole is a particular matter of debate ; some see the poem as ultimately pessimistic and politically subversive to the Augustan regime , while others view it as a celebration of the new imperial dynasty . Virgil makes use of the symbolism of the Augustan regime , and some scholars see strong associations between Augustus and Aeneas , the one as founder and the other as re-founder of Rome . A strong teleology , or drive towards a climax , has been detected in the poem . The Aeneid is full of prophecies about the future of Rome , the deeds of Augustus , his ancestors , and famous Romans , and the Carthaginian Wars ; the shield of Aeneas even depicts Augustus ' victory at Actium against Mark Antony and Cleopatra VII in 31 BC . A further focus of study is the character of Aeneas . As the protagonist of the poem , Aeneas seems to waver constantly between his emotions and commitment to his prophetic duty to found Rome ; critics note the breakdown of Aeneas ' emotional control in the last sections of the poem where the " pious " and " righteous " Aeneas mercilessly slaughters Turnus .
Bon Jovi 's third album , Slippery When Wet ( 1986 ) , mixed hard rock with a pop sensitivity and spent a total of 8 weeks at the top of the Billboard 200 album chart , selling 12 million copies in the US while becoming the first hard rock album to spawn three top 10 singles — two of which reached number one . The album has been credited with widening the audiences for the genre , particularly by appealing to women as well as the traditional male dominated audience , and opening the door to MTV and commercial success for other bands at the end of the decade . The anthemic The Final Countdown ( 1986 ) by Swedish group Europe was an international hit , reaching number eight on the US charts while hitting the top 10 in nine other countries . This era also saw more glam-infused American hard rock bands come to the forefront , with both Poison and Cinderella releasing their multi-platinum début albums in 1986 . Van Halen released 5150 ( 1986 ) , their first album with Sammy Hagar on lead vocals , which was number one in the US for three weeks and sold over 6 million copies . By the second half of the decade , hard rock had become the most reliable form of commercial popular music in the United States .
President Bush denied funding to the UNFPA . Over the course of the Bush Administration , a total of $ 244 million in Congressionally approved funding was blocked by the Executive Branch .
Luther 's 1524 creedal hymn " Wir glauben all an einen Gott " ( " We All Believe in One True God " ) is a three-stanza confession of faith prefiguring Luther 's 1529 three-part explanation of the Apostles ' Creed in the Small Catechism . Luther 's hymn , adapted and expanded from an earlier German creedal hymn , gained widespread use in vernacular Lutheran liturgies as early as 1525 . Sixteenth-century Lutheran hymnals also included " Wir glauben all " among the catechetical hymns , although 18th-century hymnals tended to label the hymn as Trinitarian rather than catechetical , and 20th-century Lutherans rarely use the hymn because of the perceived difficulty of its tune .
Six-time Grammy winner and Academy Award nominee Lady Gaga performed the national anthem , while Academy Award winner Marlee Matlin provided American Sign Language ( ASL ) translation .
The Panthers seemed primed to score on their opening drive of the second half when Newton completed a 45-yard pass to Ted Ginn Jr. on the Denver 35-yard line on their second offensive play . But the Broncos defense halted the drive on the 26-yard line , and it ended with no points when Graham Gano hit the uprights on a 44-yard field goal attempt . After the miss , Manning completed a pair of passes to Emmanuel Sanders for gains of 25 and 22 yards , setting up McManus ' 33-yard field goal that gave the Broncos a 16–7 lead . Carolina got off to another strong start after the kickoff , with Newton completing a 42-yard pass to Corey Brown . But once again they came up empty , this time as a result of a Newton pass that bounced off the hands of Ginn and was intercepted by safety T. J . Ward . Ward fumbled the ball during the return , but Trevathan recovered it to enable Denver to keep possession .
The Broncos ' defense ranked first in the NFL yards allowed ( 4,530 ) for the first time in franchise history , and fourth in points allowed ( 296 ) . Defensive ends Derek Wolfe and Malik Jackson each had 5½ sacks . Pro Bowl linebacker Von Miller led the team with 11 sacks , forced four fumbles , and recovered three . Linebacker DeMarcus Ware was selected to play in the Pro Bowl for the ninth time in his career , ranking second on the team with 7½ sacks . Linebacker Brandon Marshall led the team in total tackles with 109 , while Danny Trevathan ranked second with 102 . Cornerbacks Aqib Talib ( three interceptions ) and Chris Harris , Jr. ( two interceptions ) were the other two Pro Bowl selections from the defense .
In the United States , macabre-rock pioneer Alice Cooper achieved mainstream success with the top ten album School 's Out ( 1972 ) . In the following year blues rockers ZZ Top released their classic album Tres Hombres and Aerosmith produced their eponymous début , as did Southern rockers Lynyrd Skynyrd and proto-punk outfit New York Dolls , demonstrating the diverse directions being pursued in the genre . Montrose , including the instrumental talent of Ronnie Montrose and vocals of Sammy Hagar and arguably the first all American hard rock band to challenge the British dominance of the genre , released their first album in 1973 . Kiss built on the theatrics of Alice Cooper and the look of the New York Dolls to produce a unique band persona , achieving their commercial breakthrough with the double live album Alive ! in 1975 and helping to take hard rock into the stadium rock era . In the mid-1970s Aerosmith achieved their commercial and artistic breakthrough with Toys in the Attic ( 1975 ) , which reached number 11 in the American album chart , and Rocks ( 1976 ) , which peaked at number three . Blue Öyster Cult , formed in the late 60s , picked up on some of the elements introduced by Black Sabbath with their breakthrough live gold album On Your Feet or on Your Knees ( 1975 ) , followed by their first platinum album , Agents of Fortune ( 1976 ) , containing the hit single " ( Do n't Fear ) The Reaper " , which reached number 12 on the Billboard charts . Journey released their eponymous debut in 1975 and the next year Boston released their highly successful début album . In the same year , hard rock bands featuring women saw commercial success as Heart released Dreamboat Annie and The Runaways débuted with their self-titled album . While Heart had a more folk-oriented hard rock sound , the Runaways leaned more towards a mix of punk-influenced music and hard rock . The Amboy Dukes , having emerged from the Detroit garage rock scene and most famous for their Top 20 psychedelic hit " Journey to the Center of the Mind " ( 1968 ) , were dissolved by their guitarist Ted Nugent , who embarked on a solo career that resulted in four successive multi-platinum albums between Ted Nugent ( 1975 ) and his best selling Double Live Gonzo ( 1978 ) .
William Champion 's brother , John , patented a process in 1758 for calcining zinc sulfide into an oxide usable in the retort process . Prior to this , only calamine could be used to produce zinc . In 1798 , Johann Christian Ruberg improved on the smelting process by building the first horizontal retort smelter . Jean-Jacques Daniel Dony built a different kind of horizontal zinc smelter in Belgium , which processed even more zinc . Italian doctor Luigi Galvani discovered in 1780 that connecting the spinal cord of a freshly dissected frog to an iron rail attached by a brass hook caused the frog 's leg to twitch . He incorrectly thought he had discovered an ability of nerves and muscles to create electricity and called the effect " animal electricity " . The galvanic cell and the process of galvanization were both named for Luigi Galvani and these discoveries paved the way for electrical batteries , galvanization and cathodic protection .
There would be no more scoring in the third quarter , but early in the fourth , the Broncos drove to the Panthers 41-yard line . On the next play , Ealy knocked the ball out of Manning 's hand as he was winding up for a pass , and then recovered it for Carolina on the 50-yard line . A 16-yard reception by Devin Funchess and a 12-yard run by Stewart then set up Gano 's 39-yard field goal , cutting the Panthers deficit to one score at 16–10 . The next three drives of the game would end in punts .
The description or representation of individual and group identity is a central task for psychologists , sociologists and anthropologists and those of other disciplines where " identity " needs to be mapped and defined . How should one describe the identity of another , in ways which encompass both their idiosyncratic qualities and their group memberships or identifications , both of which can shift according to circumstance ? Following on from the work of Kelly , Erikson , Tajfel and others Weinreich 's Identity Structure Analysis ( ISA ) , is " a structural representation of the individual 's existential experience , in which the relationships between self and other agents are organised in relatively stable structures over time … with the emphasis on the socio-cultural milieu in which self relates to other agents and institutions " ( Weinreich and Saunderson , ( eds ) 2003 , p1 ) . Using constructs drawn from the salient discourses of the individual , the group and cultural norms , the practical operationalisation of ISA provides a methodology that maps how these are used by the individual , applied across time and milieus by the " situated self " to appraise self and other agents and institutions ( for example , resulting in the individual 's evaluation of self and significant others and institutions ) .

From the 2000 census [ update ] , 60,455 or 47.0 % belonged to the Swiss Reformed Church , while 31,510 or 24.5 % were Roman Catholic . Of the rest of the population , there were 1,874 members of an Orthodox church ( or about 1.46 % of the population ) , there were 229 persons ( or about 0.18 % of the population ) who belonged to the Christian Catholic Church , and there were 5,531 persons ( or about 4.30 % of the population ) who belonged to another Christian church . There were 324 persons ( or about 0.25 % of the population ) who were Jewish , and 4,907 ( or about 3.81 % of the population ) who were Muslim . There were 629 persons who were Buddhist , 1,430 persons who were Hindu and 177 persons who belonged to another church . 16,363 ( or about 12.72 % of the population ) belonged to no church , are agnostic or atheist , and 7,855 persons ( or about 6.11 % of the population ) did not answer the question . On 14 December 2014 the Haus der Religionen was inaugurated .

Zinc metal is produced using extractive metallurgy . After grinding the ore , froth flotation , which selectively separates minerals from gangue by taking advantage of differences in their hydrophobicity , is used to get an ore concentrate . This concentrate consists of about 50 % zinc with the rest being sulfur ( 32 % ) , iron ( 13 % ) , and SiO 2 ( 5 % ) . The composition of this is normally zinc sulfide ( 80 % to 85 % ) , iron sulfide ( 7.0 % to 12 % ) , lead sulfide ( 3.0 % to 5.0 % ) silica ( 2.5 % to 3.5 % ) , and cadmium sulfide ( 0.35 % to 0.41 % ) .
Since 1962 , the cardinal bishops have only a titular relationship with the suburbicarian sees , with no powers of governance over them . Each see has its own bishop , with the exception of Ostia , in which the Cardinal Vicar of the see of Rome is apostolic administrator .

When in choir dress , a Latin-rite cardinal wears scarlet garments — the blood-like red symbolizes a cardinal 's willingness to die for his faith . Excluding the rochet — which is always white — the scarlet garments include the cassock , mozzetta , and biretta ( over the usual scarlet zucchetto ) . The biretta of a cardinal is distinctive not merely for its scarlet color , but also for the fact that it does not have a pompon or tassel on the top as do the birettas of other prelates . Until the 1460s , it was customary for cardinals to wear a violet or blue cape unless granted the privilege of wearing red when acting on papal business . His normal-wear cassock is black but has scarlet piping and a scarlet fascia ( sash ) . Occasionally , a cardinal wears a scarlet ferraiolo which is a cape worn over the shoulders , tied at the neck in a bow by narrow strips of cloth in the front , without any 'trim ' or piping on it . It is because of the scarlet color of cardinals ' vesture that the bird of the same name has become known as such . [ citation needed ]
The Egyptians were one of the first major civilisations to codify design elements in art and architecture . Egyptian blue , also known as calcium copper silicate is a pigment used by Egyptians for thousands of years . It is considered to be the first synthetic pigment . The wall paintings done in the service of the Pharaohs followed a rigid code of visual rules and meanings . Egyptian civilisation is renowned for its colossal pyramids , temples and monumental tombs . Well-known examples are the Pyramid of Djoser designed by ancient architect and engineer Imhotep , the Sphinx , and the temple of Abu Simbel . Modern and contemporary Egyptian art can be as diverse as any works in the world art scene , from the vernacular architecture of Hassan Fathy and Ramses Wissa Wassef , to Mahmoud Mokhtar 's sculptures , to the distinctive Coptic iconography of Isaac Fanous . The Cairo Opera House serves as the main performing arts venue in the Egyptian capital .
Zinc chemistry is similar to the chemistry of the late first-row transition metals nickel and copper , though it has a filled d-shell , so its compounds are diamagnetic and mostly colorless . The ionic radii of zinc and magnesium happen to be nearly identical . Because of this some of their salts have the same crystal structure and in circumstances where ionic radius is a determining factor zinc and magnesium chemistries have much in common . Otherwise there is little similarity . Zinc tends to form bonds with a greater degree of covalency and it forms much more stable complexes with N- and S- donors . Complexes of zinc are mostly 4- or 6- coordinate although 5-coordinate complexes are known .
Another misunderstanding is that , by her immaculate conception , Mary did not need a saviour . When defining the dogma in Ineffabilis Deus , Pope Pius IX explicitly affirmed that Mary was redeemed in a manner more sublime . He stated that Mary , rather than being cleansed after sin , was completely prevented from contracting Original Sin in view of the foreseen merits of Jesus Christ , the Savior of the human race . In Luke 1:47 , Mary proclaims : " My spirit has rejoiced in God my Saviour . " This is referred to as Mary 's pre-redemption by Christ . Since the Second Council of Orange against semi-pelagianism , the Catholic Church has taught that even had man never sinned in the Garden of Eden and was sinless , he would still require God 's grace to remain sinless .
During the apartheid era , those classed as " Coloured " were oppressed and discriminated against . But , they had limited rights and overall had slightly better socioeconomic conditions than those classed as " Black " . The government required that Blacks and Coloureds live in areas separate from Whites , creating large townships located away from the cities as areas for Blacks .
The official language of Bern is ( the Swiss variety of Standard ) German , but the main spoken language is the Alemannic Swiss German dialect called Bernese German .
After a punt from both teams , Carolina got on track with a 9-play , 73-yard scoring drive . Newton completed 4 of 4 passes for 51 yards and rushed twice for 25 yards , while Jonathan Stewart finished the drive with a 1-yard touchdown run , cutting the score to 10–7 with 11:28 left in the second quarter . Later on , Broncos receiver Jordan Norwood received Brad Nortman 's short 28-yard punt surrounded by Panthers players , but none of them attempted to make a tackle , apparently thinking Norwood had called a fair catch . Norwood had not done so , and with no resistance around him , he took off for a Super Bowl record 61-yard return before Mario Addison dragged him down on the Panthers 14-yard line . Despite Denver 's excellent field position , they could not get the ball into the end zone , so McManus kicked a 33-yard field goal that increased their lead to 13–7 .
The theologians , including Zwingli , Melanchthon , Martin Bucer , and Johannes Oecolampadius , differed on the significance of the words spoken by Jesus at the Last Supper : " This is my body which is for you " and " This cup is the new covenant in my blood " ( 1 Corinthians 11:23–26 ) . Luther insisted on the Real Presence of the body and blood of Christ in the consecrated bread and wine , which he called the sacramental union , while his opponents believed God to be only spiritually or symbolically present . Zwingli , for example , denied Jesus ' ability to be in more than one place at a time but Luther stressed the omnipresence of his human nature . According to transcripts , the debate sometimes became confrontational . Citing Jesus ' words " The flesh profiteth nothing " ( John 6.63 ) , Zwingli said , " This passage breaks your neck " . " Do n't be too proud , " Luther retorted , " German necks do n't break that easily . This is Hesse , not Switzerland . " On his table Luther wrote the words " Hoc est corpus meum " ( " This is my body " ) in chalk , to continually indicate his firm stance .
Despite his victory in Wittenberg , Luther was unable to stifle radicalism further afield . Preachers such as Zwickau prophet Nicholas Storch and Thomas Müntzer helped instigate the German Peasants ' War of 1524–25 , during which many atrocities were committed , often in Luther 's name . There had been revolts by the peasantry on a smaller scale since the 15th century . Luther 's pamphlets against the Church and the hierarchy , often worded with " liberal " phraseology , now led many peasants to believe he would support an attack on the upper classes in general . Revolts broke out in Franconia , Swabia , and Thuringia in 1524 , even drawing support from disaffected nobles , many of whom were in debt . Gaining momentum under the leadership of radicals such as Müntzer in Thuringia and Michael Gaismair in Tyrol , the revolts turned into war .
In response to demands for a German liturgy , Luther wrote a German Mass , which he published in early 1526 . He did not intend it as a replacement for his 1523 adaptation of the Latin Mass but as an alternative for the " simple people " , a " public stimulation for people to believe and become Christians . " Luther based his order on the Catholic service but omitted " everything that smacks of sacrifice " ; and the Mass became a celebration where everyone received the wine as well as the bread . He retained the elevation of the host and chalice , while trappings such as the Mass vestments , altar , and candles were made optional , allowing freedom of ceremony . Some reformers , including followers of Huldrych Zwingli , considered Luther 's service too papistic ; and modern scholars note the conservatism of his alternative to the Catholic mass . Luther 's service , however , included congregational singing of hymns and psalms in German , as well as of parts of the liturgy , including Luther 's unison setting of the Creed . To reach the simple people and the young , Luther incorporated religious instruction into the weekday services in the form of the catechism . He also provided simplified versions of the baptism and marriage services .
In 2000 [ update ] , there were 94,367 workers who commuted into the municipality and 16,424 workers who commuted away . The municipality is a net importer of workers , with about 5.7 workers entering the municipality for every one leaving . Of the working population , 50.6 % used public transport to get to work , and 20.6 % used a private car .

Anthropologists have contributed to the debate by shifting the focus of research : One of the first challenges for the researcher wishing to carry out empirical research in this area is to identify an appropriate analytical tool . The concept of boundaries is useful here for demonstrating how identity works . In the same way as Barth , in his approach to ethnicity , advocated the critical focus for investigation as being " the ethnic boundary that defines the group rather than the cultural stuff that it encloses " ( 1969:15 ) , social anthropologists such as Cohen and Bray have shifted the focus of analytical study from identity to the boundaries that are used for purposes of identification . If identity is a kind of virtual site in which the dynamic processes and markers used for identification are made apparent , boundaries provide the framework on which this virtual site is built . They concentrated on how the idea of community belonging is differently constructed by individual members and how individuals within the group conceive ethnic boundaries .
The Egyptian military has dozens of factories manufacturing weapons as well as consumer goods . The Armed Forces ' inventory includes equipment from different countries around the world . Equipment from the former Soviet Union is being progressively replaced by more modern US , French , and British equipment , a significant portion of which is built under license in Egypt , such as the M1 Abrams tank . [ citation needed ] Relations with Russia have improved significantly following Mohamed Morsi 's removal and both countries have worked since then to strengthen military and trade ties among other aspects of bilateral co-operation . Relations with China have also improved considerably . In 2014 , Egypt and China have established a bilateral " comprehensive strategic partnership " .
BSkyB initially charged additional subscription fees for using a Sky+ PVR with their service ; waiving the charge for subscribers whose package included two or more premium channels . This changed as from 1 July 2007 , and now customers that have Sky+ and subscribe to any BSkyB subscription package get Sky+ included at no extra charge . Customers that do not subscribe to BSkyB 's channels can still pay a monthly fee to enable Sky+ functions . In January 2010 BSkyB discontinued the Sky+ Box , limited the standard Sky Box to Multiroom upgrade only and started to issue the Sky+HD Box as standard , thus giving all new subscribers the functions of Sky+ . In February 2011 BSkyB discontinued the non-HD variant of its Multiroom box , offering a smaller version of the SkyHD box without Sky+ functionality . In September 2007 , Sky launched a new TV advertising campaign targeting Sky+ at women . As of 31 March 2008 , Sky had 3,393,000 Sky+ users .
Luther 's Commentary on Genesis contains a passage which concludes that " the soul does not sleep ( anima non sic dormit ) , but wakes ( sed vigilat ) and experiences visions " . Francis Blackburne in 1765 argued that John Jortin misread this and other passages from Luther , while Gottfried Fritschel pointed out in 1867 that it actually refers to the soul of a man " in this life " ( homo enim in hac vita ) tired from his daily labour ( defatigus diurno labore ) who at night enters his bedchamber ( sub noctem intrat in cubiculum suum ) and whose sleep is interrupted by dreams .
Concerns were raised over whether Levi 's Stadium 's field was of a high enough quality to host a Super Bowl ; during the inaugural season , the field had to be re-sodded multiple times due to various issues , and during a week 6 game earlier in the 2015 season , a portion of the turf collapsed under Baltimore Ravens kicker Justin Tucker , causing him to slip and miss a field goal , although the field has not had any major issues since . As is customary for Super Bowl games played at natural grass stadiums , the NFL re-sodded the field with a new playing surface ; a hybrid Bermuda 419 turf . NFL and Atlanta Braves field director Ed Mangan stated that the field was in " great shape " for gameday . However , the turf showed problem throughout the game , with a number of players needing to change their cleats during the game and player slipping during plays all throughout the game .
Manning finished the year with a career-low 67.9 passer rating , throwing for 2,249 yards and nine touchdowns , with 17 interceptions . In contrast , Osweiler threw for 1,967 yards , 10 touchdowns and six interceptions for a rating of 86.4 . Veteran receiver Demaryius Thomas led the team with 105 receptions for 1,304 yards and six touchdowns , while Emmanuel Sanders caught 76 passes for 1,135 yards and six scores , while adding another 106 yards returning punts . Tight end Owen Daniels was also a big element of the passing game with 46 receptions for 517 yards . Running back C. J. Anderson was the team 's leading rusher 863 yards and seven touchdowns , while also catching 25 passes for 183 yards . Running back Ronnie Hillman also made a big impact with 720 yards , five touchdowns , 24 receptions , and a 4.7 yards per carry average . Overall , the offense ranked 19th in scoring with 355 points and did not have any Pro Bowl selections .
Zinc is an essential mineral perceived by the public today as being of " exceptional biologic and public health importance " , especially regarding prenatal and postnatal development . Zinc deficiency affects about two billion people in the developing world and is associated with many diseases . In children it causes growth retardation , delayed sexual maturation , infection susceptibility , and diarrhea . Enzymes with a zinc atom in the reactive center are widespread in biochemistry , such as alcohol dehydrogenase in humans . Consumption of excess zinc can cause ataxia , lethargy and copper deficiency .
With 4:51 left in regulation , Carolina got the ball on their own 24-yard line with a chance to mount a game-winning drive , and soon faced 3rd-and-9 . On the next play , Miller stripped the ball away from Newton , and after several players dove for it , it took a long bounce backwards and was recovered by Ward , who returned it five yards to the Panthers 4-yard line . Although several players dove into the pile to attempt to recover it , Newton did not and his lack of aggression later earned him heavy criticism . Meanwhile , Denver 's offense was kept out of the end zone for three plays , but a holding penalty on cornerback Josh Norman gave the Broncos a new set of downs . Then Anderson scored on a 2-yard touchdown run and Manning completed a pass to Bennie Fowler for a 2-point conversion , giving Denver a 24–10 lead with 3:08 left and essentially putting the game away . Carolina had two more drives , but failed to get a first down on each one .
In the US , African Americans , who include multiracial people , earn 75 % of what white people earn . In Brazil , people of color earn less than 50 % of what whites earn . Some have posited that the facts of lower socioeconomic status for people of color suggest that Brazil practices a kind of one-drop rule , or discrimination against people who are not visibly European in ancestry . The gap in income between blacks and other non-whites is relatively small compared to the large gap between whites and all people of color . Other social factors , such as illiteracy and education levels , show the same patterns of disadvantage for people of color . Some commentators observe that the United States practice of segregation and white supremacy in the South , and discrimination in many areas outside that region , forced many African Americans to unite in the civil rights struggle . They suggest that the fluid nature of race in Brazil has divided individuals of African descent , between those with more or less ancestry . As a result , they have not united for a stronger civil rights movement . [ citation needed ]

Lewinter previously served as chairman and CEO of Universal Motown Republic Group . In January 2012 , Dennis Kooker was named President of Global Digital Business and US Sales .
Over the next five days , private conferences were held to determine Luther 's fate . The Emperor presented the final draft of the Edict of Worms on 25 May 1521 , declaring Luther an outlaw , banning his literature , and requiring his arrest : " We want him to be apprehended and punished as a notorious heretic . " It also made it a crime for anyone in Germany to give Luther food or shelter . It permitted anyone to kill Luther without legal consequence .
BSkyB initially charged additional subscription fees for using a Sky+ PVR with their service ; waiving the charge for subscribers whose package included two or more premium channels . This changed as from 1 July 2007 , and now customers that have Sky+ and subscribe to any BSkyB subscription package get Sky+ included at no extra charge . Customers that do not subscribe to BSkyB 's channels can still pay a monthly fee to enable Sky+ functions . In January 2010 BSkyB discontinued the Sky+ Box , limited the standard Sky Box to Multiroom upgrade only and started to issue the Sky+HD Box as standard , thus giving all new subscribers the functions of Sky+ . In February 2011 BSkyB discontinued the non-HD variant of its Multiroom box , offering a smaller version of the SkyHD box without Sky+ functionality . In September 2007 , Sky launched a new TV advertising campaign targeting Sky+ at women . As of 31 March 2008 , Sky had 3,393,000 Sky+ users .

Despite some concerns , western vegetarians and vegans have not been found to suffer from overt zinc deficiencies any more than meat-eaters . Major plant sources of zinc include cooked dried beans , sea vegetables , fortified cereals , soyfoods , nuts , peas , and seeds . However , phytates in many whole-grains and fiber in many foods may interfere with zinc absorption and marginal zinc intake has poorly understood effects . The zinc chelator phytate , found in seeds and cereal bran , can contribute to zinc malabsorption . There is some evidence to suggest that more than the US RDA ( 15 mg ) of zinc daily may be needed in those whose diet is high in phytates , such as some vegetarians . These considerations must be balanced against the fact that there is a paucity of adequate zinc biomarkers , and the most widely used indicator , plasma zinc , has poor sensitivity and specificity . Diagnosing zinc deficiency is a persistent challenge .
In early times , the privilege of papal election was not reserved to the cardinals , and for centuries the person elected was customarily a Roman priest and never a bishop from elsewhere . To preserve apostolic succession the rite of consecrating him a bishop had to be performed by someone who was already a bishop . The rule remains that , if the person elected Pope is not yet a bishop , he is consecrated by the Dean of the College of Cardinals , the Cardinal Bishop of Ostia .
On 18 January 2014 , the interim government instituted a new constitution following a referendum in which 98.1 % of voters were supportive . Participation was low with only 38.6 % of registered voters participating although this was higher than the 33 % who voted in a referendum during Morsi 's tenure . On 26 March 2014 Abdel Fattah el-Sisi the head of the Egyptian Armed Forces , who at this time was in control of the country , resigned from the military , announcing he would stand as a candidate in the 2014 presidential election . The poll , held between 26 and 28 May 2014 , resulted in a landslide victory for el-Sisi . Sisi was sworn into office as President of Egypt on 8 June 2014 . The Muslim Brotherhood and some liberal and secular activist groups boycotted the vote . Even though the military-backed authorities extended voting to a third day , the 46 % turnout was lower than the 52 % turnout in the 2012 election .
A psychological identity relates to self-image ( one 's mental model of oneself ) , self-esteem , and individuality . Consequently , Weinreich gives the definition " A person 's identity is defined as the totality of one 's self-construal , in which how one construes oneself in the present expresses the continuity between how one construes oneself as one was in the past and how one construes oneself as one aspires to be in the future " ; this allows for definitions of aspects of identity , such as : " One 's ethnic identity is defined as that part of the totality of one 's self-construal made up of those dimensions that express the continuity between one 's construal of past ancestry and one 's future aspirations in relation to ethnicity " ( Weinreich , 1986a ) .
In Latin , on the other hand , the [ First name ] Cardinal [ Surname ] order is used in the proclamation of the election of a new pope by the cardinal protodeacon : " Annuntio vobis gaudium magnum ; habemus Papam : Eminentissimum ac Reverendissimum Dominum , Dominum ( first name ) Sanctae Romanae Ecclesiae Cardinalem ( last name ) , ... " ( Meaning : " I announce to you a great joy ; we have a Pope : The Most Eminent and Most Reverend Lord , Lord ( first name ) Cardinal of the Holy Roman Church ( last name ) , ... " ) This assumes that the new pope had been a cardinal just before becoming pope ; the most recent election of a non-cardinal as pope was in 1378 .
Zinc chemistry is similar to the chemistry of the late first-row transition metals nickel and copper , though it has a filled d-shell , so its compounds are diamagnetic and mostly colorless . The ionic radii of zinc and magnesium happen to be nearly identical . Because of this some of their salts have the same crystal structure and in circumstances where ionic radius is a determining factor zinc and magnesium chemistries have much in common . Otherwise there is little similarity . Zinc tends to form bonds with a greater degree of covalency and it forms much more stable complexes with N- and S- donors . Complexes of zinc are mostly 4- or 6- coordinate although 5-coordinate complexes are known .
The official policy became one of biological and cultural assimilation : " Eliminate the full-blood and permit the white admixture to half-castes and eventually the race will become white " . This led to different treatment for " black " and " half-caste " individuals , with lighter-skinned individuals targeted for removal from their families to be raised as " white " people , restricted from speaking their native language and practising traditional customs , a process now known as the Stolen Generation .
From outside the United Kingdom and the United States , the Canadian trio Rush released three distinctively hard rock albums in 1974–75 ( Rush , Fly by Night and Caress of Steel ) before moving toward a more progressive sound with the 1976 album 2112 . The Irish band Thin Lizzy , which had formed in the late 1960s , made their most substantial commercial breakthrough in 1976 with the hard rock album Jailbreak and their worldwide hit " The Boys Are Back in Town " , which reached number 8 in the UK and number 12 in the US . Their style , consisting of two duelling guitarists often playing leads in harmony , proved itself to be a large influence on later bands . They reached their commercial , and arguably their artistic peak with Black Rose : A Rock Legend ( 1979 ) . The arrival of Scorpions from Germany marked the geographical expansion of the subgenre . Australian-formed AC/DC , with a stripped back , riff heavy and abrasive style that also appealed to the punk generation , began to gain international attention from 1976 , culminating in the release of their multi-platinum albums Let There Be Rock ( 1977 ) and Highway to Hell ( 1979 ) . Also influenced by a punk ethos were heavy metal bands like Motörhead , while Judas Priest abandoned the remaining elements of the blues in their music , further differentiating the hard rock and heavy metal styles and helping to create the New Wave of British Heavy Metal which was pursued by bands like Iron Maiden , Saxon and Venom .
A few hard rock bands from the 1970s and 1980s managed to sustain highly successful recording careers . Bon Jovi were still able to achieve a commercial hit with " It 's My Life " from their double platinum-certified album Crush ( 2000 ) . and AC/DC released the platinum-certified Stiff Upper Lip ( 2000 ) Aerosmith released a number two platinum album , Just Push Play ( 2001 ) , which saw the band foray further into pop with the Top 10 hit " Jaded " , and a blues cover album , Honkin ' on Bobo , which reached number five in 2004 . Heart achieved their first Top 10 album since the early 90s with Red Velvet Car in 2010 , becoming the first female-led hard rock band to earn Top 10 albums spanning five decades . There were reunions and subsequent tours from Van Halen ( with Hagar in 2004 and then Roth in 2007 ) , The Who ( delayed in 2002 by the death of bassist John Entwistle until 2006 ) and Black Sabbath ( with Osbourne 1997–2006 and Dio 2006–2010 ) and even a one off performance by Led Zeppelin ( 2007 ) , renewing the interest in previous eras . Additionally , hard rock supergroups , such as Audioslave ( with former members of Rage Against the Machine and Soundgarden ) and Velvet Revolver ( with former members of Guns N ' Roses , punk band Wasted Youth and Stone Temple Pilots singer Scott Weiland ) , emerged and experienced some success . However , these bands were short-lived , ending in 2007 and 2008 , respectively . The long awaited Guns N ' Roses album Chinese Democracy was finally released in 2008 , but only went platinum and failed to come close to the success of the band 's late 1980s and early 1990s material . More successfully , AC/DC released the double platinum-certified Black Ice ( 2008 ) . Bon Jovi continued to enjoy success , branching into country music with " Who Says You Ca n't Go Home " , which reached number one on the Hot Country Singles chart in 2006 , and the rock/country album Lost Highway , which reached number one in 2007 . In 2009 , Bon Jovi released another number one album , The Circle , which marked a return to their hard rock sound .
The Egyptian military has dozens of factories manufacturing weapons as well as consumer goods . The Armed Forces ' inventory includes equipment from different countries around the world . Equipment from the former Soviet Union is being progressively replaced by more modern US , French , and British equipment , a significant portion of which is built under license in Egypt , such as the M1 Abrams tank . [ citation needed ] Relations with Russia have improved significantly following Mohamed Morsi 's removal and both countries have worked since then to strengthen military and trade ties among other aspects of bilateral co-operation . Relations with China have also improved considerably . In 2014 , Egypt and China have established a bilateral " comprehensive strategic partnership " .
The Panthers defense gave up just 308 points , ranking sixth in the league , while also leading the NFL in interceptions with 24 and boasting four Pro Bowl selections . Pro Bowl defensive tackle Kawann Short led the team in sacks with 11 , while also forcing three fumbles and recovering two . Fellow lineman Mario Addison added 6½ sacks . The Panthers line also featured veteran defensive end Jared Allen , a 5-time pro bowler who was the NFL 's active career sack leader with 136 , along with defensive end Kony Ealy , who had 5 sacks in just 9 starts . Behind them , two of the Panthers three starting linebackers were also selected to play in the Pro Bowl : Thomas Davis and Luke Kuechly . Davis compiled 5½ sacks , four forced fumbles , and four interceptions , while Kuechly led the team in tackles ( 118 ) forced two fumbles , and intercepted four passes of his own . Carolina 's secondary featured Pro Bowl safety Kurt Coleman , who led the team with a career high seven interceptions , while also racking up 88 tackles and Pro Bowl cornerback Josh Norman , who developed into a shutdown corner during the season and had four interceptions , two of which were returned for touchdowns .
Constitutional changes voted on 19 March 2007 prohibited parties from using religion as a basis for political activity , allowed the drafting of a new anti-terrorism law , authorised broad police powers of arrest and surveillance , and gave the president power to dissolve parliament and end judicial election monitoring . In 2009 , Dr. Ali El Deen Hilal Dessouki , Media Secretary of the National Democratic Party ( NDP ) , described Egypt as a " pharaonic " political system , and democracy as a " long-term goal " . Dessouki also stated that " the real center of power in Egypt is the military " .
Various gold-themed promotions and initiatives were held throughout the 2015 NFL season to tie into the " Golden Super Bowl " ; gold-tinted logos were implemented across the NFL 's properties and painted on fields , the numbering of the 50-yard line on fields was colored gold , and beginning on week 7 , all sideline jackets and hats featured gold-trimmed logos . Gold footballs were given to each high school that has had a player or coach appear in the Super Bowl , and " homecoming " events were also held by Super Bowl-winning teams at games .
Kenneth Gergen formulated additional classifications , which include the strategic manipulator , the pastiche personality , and the relational self . The strategic manipulator is a person who begins to regard all senses of identity merely as role-playing exercises , and who gradually becomes alienated from his or her social " self " . The pastiche personality abandons all aspirations toward a true or " essential " identity , instead viewing social interactions as opportunities to play out , and hence become , the roles they play . Finally , the relational self is a perspective by which persons abandon all sense of exclusive self , and view all sense of identity in terms of social engagement with others . For Gergen , these strategies follow one another in phases , and they are linked to the increase in popularity of postmodern culture and the rise of telecommunications technology .
For the first time , the Super Bowl 50 Host Committee and the NFL have openly sought disabled veteran and lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender-owned businesses in Business Connect , the Super Bowl program that provides local companies with contracting opportunities in and around the Super Bowl . The host committee has already raised over $ 40 million through sponsors including Apple , Google , Yahoo ! , Intel , Gap , Chevron , and Dignity Health .
The opening years of the 1980s saw a number of changes in personnel and direction of established hard rock acts , including the deaths of Bon Scott , the lead singer of AC/DC , and John Bonham , drummer with Led Zeppelin . Whereas Zeppelin broke up almost immediately afterwards , AC/DC pressed on , recording the album Back in Black ( 1980 ) with their new lead singer , Brian Johnson . It became the fifth-highest-selling album of all time in the US and the second-highest-selling album in the world . Black Sabbath had split with original singer Ozzy Osbourne in 1979 and replaced him with Ronnie James Dio , formerly of Rainbow , giving the band a new sound and a period of creativity and popularity beginning with Heaven and Hell ( 1980 ) . Osbourne embarked on a solo career with Blizzard of Ozz ( 1980 ) , featuring American guitarist Randy Rhoads . Some bands , such as Queen , moved away from their hard rock roots and more towards pop rock , while others , including Rush with Moving Pictures ( 1981 ) , began to return to a hard rock sound . The creation of thrash metal , which mixed heavy metal with elements of hardcore punk from about 1982 , particularly by Metallica , Anthrax , Megadeth and Slayer , helped to create extreme metal and further remove the style from hard rock , although a number of these bands or their members would continue to record some songs closer to a hard rock sound . Kiss moved away from their hard rock roots toward pop metal : firstly removing their makeup in 1983 for their Lick It Up album , and then adopting the visual and sound of glam metal for their 1984 release , Animalize , both of which marked a return to commercial success . Pat Benatar was one of the first women to achieve commercial success in hard rock , with three successive Top 5 albums between 1980 and 1982 .
Egypt has one of the longest histories of any modern country , arising in the tenth millennium BC as one of the world 's first nation states . Considered a cradle of civilisation , Ancient Egypt experienced some of the earliest developments of writing , agriculture , urbanisation , organised religion and central government . Iconic monuments such as the Giza Necropolis and its Great Sphinx , as well the ruins of Memphis , Thebes , Karnak , and the Valley of the Kings , reflect this legacy and remain a significant focus of archaeological study and popular interest worldwide . Egypt 's rich cultural heritage is an integral part of its national identity , having endured , and at times assimilated , various foreign influences , including Greek , Persian , Roman , Arab , Ottoman , and European . Although Christianised in the first century of the Common Era , it was subsequently Islamised due to the Islamic conquests of the seventh century .
There are many styles of mandolin , but four are common , the Neapolitan or round-backed mandolin , the carved-top mandolin and the flat-backed mandolin . The round-back has a deep bottom , constructed of strips of wood , glued together into a bowl . The carved-top or arch-top mandolin has a much shallower , arched back , and an arched top—both carved out of wood . The flat-backed mandolin uses thin sheets of wood for the body , braced on the inside for strength in a similar manner to a guitar . Each style of instrument has its own sound quality and is associated with particular forms of music . Neapolitan mandolins feature prominently in European classical music and traditional music . Carved-top instruments are common in American folk music and bluegrass music . Flat-backed instruments are commonly used in Irish , British and Brazilian folk music . Some modern Brazilian instruments feature an extra fifth course tuned a fifth lower than the standard fourth course .
Egyptian President Anwar Sadat had a mother who was a dark-skinned Nubian Sudanese woman and a father who was a lighter-skinned Egyptian . In response to an advertisement for an acting position , as a young man he said , " I am not white but I am not exactly black either . My blackness is tending to reddish " .
The structure of Bern 's city centre is largely medieval and has been recognised by UNESCO as a Cultural World Heritage Site . Perhaps its most famous sight is the Zytglogge ( Bernese German for " Time Bell " ) , an elaborate medieval clock tower with moving puppets . It also has an impressive 15th century Gothic cathedral , the Münster , and a 15th-century town hall . Thanks to 6 kilometres ( 4 miles ) of arcades , the old town boasts one of the longest covered shopping promenades in Europe .
Archbishop Albrecht of Mainz and Magdeburg did not reply to Luther 's letter containing the 95 Theses . He had the theses checked for heresy and in December 1517 forwarded them to Rome . He needed the revenue from the indulgences to pay off a papal dispensation for his tenure of more than one bishopric . As Luther later noted , " the pope had a finger in the pie as well , because one half was to go to the building of St Peter 's Church in Rome " .
CBS set the base rate for a 30-second advertisement at $ 5,000,000 , a record high price for a Super Bowl ad . As of January 26 , the advertisements had not yet sold out . CBS mandated that all advertisers purchase a package covering time on both the television and digital broadcasts of the game , meaning that for the first time , digital streams of the game would carry all national advertising in pattern with the television broadcast . This would be the final year in a multi-year contract with Anheuser-Busch InBev that allowed the beer manufacturer to air multiple advertisements during the game at a steep discount . It was also the final year that Doritos , a longtime sponsor of the game , held its " Crash the Super Bowl " contest that allowed viewers to create their own Doritos ads for a chance to have it aired during the game . Nintendo and The Pokémon Company also made their Super Bowl debut , promoting the 20th anniversary of the Pokémon video game and media franchise .
Egypt has one of the oldest civilisations in the world . It has been in contact with many other civilisations and nations and has been through so many eras , starting from prehistoric age to the modern age , passing through so many ages such as ; Pharonic , Roman , Greek , Islamic and many other ages . Because of this wide variation of ages , the continuous contact with other nations and the big number of conflicts Egypt had been through , at least 60 museums may be found in Egypt , mainly covering a wide area of these ages and conflicts .
Additionally , there are around 60,000 non-Jewish African immigrants in Israel , some of whom have sought asylum . Most of the migrants are from communities in Sudan and Eritrea , particularly the Niger-Congo-speaking Nuba groups of the southern Nuba Mountains ; some are illegal immigrants .
Groups that emerged from the American psychedelic scene about the same time included Iron Butterfly , MC5 , Blue Cheer and Vanilla Fudge . San Francisco band Blue Cheer released a crude and distorted cover of Eddie Cochran 's classic " Summertime Blues " , from their 1968 debut album Vincebus Eruptum , that outlined much of the later hard rock and heavy metal sound . The same month , Steppenwolf released its self-titled debut album , including " Born to Be Wild " , which contained the first lyrical reference to heavy metal and helped popularise the style when it was used in the film Easy Rider ( 1969 ) . Iron Butterfly 's In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida ( 1968 ) , with its 17-minute-long title track , using organs and with a lengthy drum solo , also prefigured later elements of the sound .
An apoplectic stroke deprived him of his speech , and he died shortly afterwards at 2:45 a.m. on 18 February 1546 , aged 62 , in Eisleben , the city of his birth . He was buried in the Castle Church in Wittenberg , beneath the pulpit . The funeral was held by his friends Johannes Bugenhagen and Philipp Melanchthon . A year later , troops of Luther 's adversary Charles V , Holy Roman Emperor entered the town , but were ordered by Charles not to disturb the grave .
Prior to the Golden Age of Mandolins , France had a history with the mandolin , with mandolinists playing in Paris until the Napoleonic Wars . The players , teachers and composers included Giovanni Fouchetti , Eduardo Mezzacapo , Gabriele Leon , and Gervasio . During the Golden age itself ( 1880s-1920s ) , the mandolin had a strong presence in France . Prominent mandolin players or composers included Jules Cottin and his sister Madeleine Cottin , Jean Pietrapertosa , and Edgar Bara . Paris had dozens of " estudiantina " mandolin orchestras in the early 1900s . Mandolin magazines included L'Estudiantina , Le Plectre , École de la mandolie .
Although the doctrine of Mary 's Immaculate Conception appears only later among Latin ( and particularly Frankish ) theologians , it became ever more manifest among Byzantine theologians reliant on Gregory Nazianzen 's Mariology in the Medieval or Byzantine East . Although hymnographers and scholars , like the Emperor Justinian I , were accustomed to call Mary " prepurified " in their poetic and credal statements , the first point of departure for more fully commenting on Nazianzen 's meaning occurs in Sophronius of Jerusalem . In other places Sophronius explains that the Theotokos was already immaculate , when she was " purified " at the Annunciation and goes so far as to note that John the Baptist is literally " holier than all 'Men ' born of woman " since Mary 's surpassing holiness signifies that she was holier than even John after his sanctification in utero . Sophronius ' teaching is augmented and incorporated by St. John Damascene ( d. 749/750 ) . John , besides many passages wherein he extolls the Theotokos for her purification at the Annunciation , grants her the unique honor of " purifying the waters of baptism by touching them . " This honor was most famously and firstly attributed to Christ , especially in the legacy of Nazianzen . As such , Nazianzen 's assertion of parallel holiness between the prepurified Mary and purified Jesus of the New Testament is made even more explicit in Damascene in his discourse on Mary 's holiness to also imitate Christ 's baptism at the Jordan . The Damascene 's hymnongraphy and De fide Orthodoxa explicitly use Mary 's " pre purification " as a key to understanding her absolute holiness and unsullied human nature . In fact , Damascene ( along with Nazianzen ) serves as the source for nearly all subsequent promotion of Mary 's complete holiness from her Conception by the " all pure seed " of Joachim and the womb " wider than heaven " of St. Ann .
The term cardinal at one time applied to any priest permanently assigned or incardinated to a church , or specifically to the senior priest of an important church , based on the Latin cardo ( hinge ) , meaning " principal " or " chief " . The term was applied in this sense as early as the ninth century to the priests of the tituli ( parishes ) of the diocese of Rome . The Church of England retains an instance of this origin of the title , which is held by the two senior members of the College of Minor Canons of St Paul 's Cathedral .
Coptic Christians face discrimination at multiple levels of the government , ranging from disproportionate representation in government ministries to laws that limit their ability to build or repair churches . Intolerance of Bahá'ís and non-orthodox Muslim sects , such as Sufis , Shi'a and Ahmadis , also remains a problem . When the government moved to computerise identification cards , members of religious minorities , such as Bahá'ís , could not obtain identification documents . An Egyptian court ruled in early 2008 that members of other faiths may obtain identity cards without listing their faiths , and without becoming officially recognised .
On 17 December 1941 , seven Protestant regional church confederations issued a statement agreeing with the policy of forcing Jews to wear the yellow badge , " since after his bitter experience Luther had already suggested preventive measures against the Jews and their expulsion from German territory . " According to Daniel Goldhagen , Bishop Martin Sasse , a leading Protestant churchman , published a compendium of Luther 's writings shortly after Kristallnacht , for which Diarmaid MacCulloch , Professor of the History of the Church in the University of Oxford argued that Luther 's writing was a " blueprint . " Sasse applauded the burning of the synagogues and the coincidence of the day , writing in the introduction , " On 10 November 1938 , on Luther 's birthday , the synagogues are burning in Germany . " The German people , he urged , ought to heed these words " of the greatest antisemite of his time , the warner of his people against the Jews . "
Luther justified his opposition to the rebels on three grounds . First , in choosing violence over lawful submission to the secular government , they were ignoring Christ 's counsel to " Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar 's " ; St. Paul had written in his epistle to the Romans 13:1–7 that all authorities are appointed by God and therefore should not be resisted . This reference from the Bible forms the foundation for the doctrine known as the Divine Right of Kings , or , in the German case , the divine right of the princes . Second , the violent actions of rebelling , robbing , and plundering placed the peasants " outside the law of God and Empire " , so they deserved " death in body and soul , if only as highwaymen and murderers . " Lastly , Luther charged the rebels with blasphemy for calling themselves " Christian brethren " and committing their sinful acts under the banner of the Gospel .
In addition to the Vince Lombardi Trophy that all Super Bowl champions receive , the winner of Super Bowl 50 will also receive a large , 18-karat gold-plated " 50 " . Each digit will weigh 33 lb ( 15 kg ) for a total of 66 lb ( 30 kg ) . Like the Lombardi Trophy , the " 50 " will be designed by Tiffany & Co .
To symbolize their bond with the papacy , the pope gives each newly appointed cardinal a gold ring , which is traditionally kissed by Catholics when greeting a cardinal ( as with a bishop 's episcopal ring ) . The pope chooses the image on the outside : under Pope Benedict XVI it was a modern depiction of the crucifixion of Jesus , with Mary and John to each side . The ring includes the pope 's coat of arms on the inside . [ citation needed ]
The Daily Mail newspaper reported in 2012 that the UK government 's benefits agency was checking claimants ' " Sky TV bills to establish if a woman in receipt of benefits as a single mother is wrongly claiming to be living alone " – as , it claimed , subscription to sports channels would betray a man 's presence in the household . In December , the UK ’ s parliament heard a claim that a subscription to BSkyB was ‘ often damaging ’ , along with alcohol , tobacco and gambling . Conservative MP Alec Shelbrooke was proposing the payments of benefits and tax credits on a " Welfare Cash Card " , in the style of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program , that could be used to buy only " essentials " .
The annual NFL Experience was held at the Moscone Center in San Francisco . In addition , " Super Bowl City " opened on January 30 at Justin Herman Plaza on The Embarcadero , featuring games and activities that will highlight the Bay Area 's technology , culinary creations , and cultural diversity . More than 1 million people are expected to attend the festivities in San Francisco during Super Bowl Week . San Francisco mayor Ed Lee said of the highly visible homeless presence in this area " they are going to have to leave " . San Francisco city supervisor Jane Kim unsuccessfully lobbied for the NFL to reimburse San Francisco for city services in the amount of $ 5 million .
Some rock musicians today use mandolins , often single-stringed electric models rather than double-stringed acoustic mandolins . One example is Tim Brennan of the Irish-American punk rock band Dropkick Murphys . In addition to electric guitar , bass , and drums , the band uses several instruments associated with traditional Celtic music , including mandolin , tin whistle , and Great Highland bagpipes . The band explains that these instruments accentuate the growling sound they favor . The 1991 R.E.M . hit " Losing My Religion " was driven by a few simple mandolin licks played by guitarist Peter Buck , who also played the mandolin in nearly a dozen other songs . The single peaked at No . 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart ( # 1 on the rock and alternative charts ) , Luther Dickinson of North Mississippi Allstars and The Black Crowes has made frequent use of the mandolin , most notably on the Black Crowes song " Locust Street . " Armenian American rock group System of A Down makes extensive use of the mandolin on their 2005 double album Mezmerize/Hypnotize . Pop punk band Green Day has used a mandolin in several occasions , especially on their 2000 album , Warning . Boyd Tinsley , violin player of the Dave Matthews Band has been using an electric mandolin since 2005 . Frontman Colin Meloy and guitarist Chris Funk of The Decemberists regularly employ the mandolin in the band 's music . Nancy Wilson , rhythm guitarist of Heart , uses a mandolin in Heart 's song " Dream of the Archer " from the album Little Queen , as well as in Heart 's cover of Led Zeppelin 's song " The Battle of Evermore . " " Show Me Heaven " by Maria McKee , the theme song to the film Days of Thunder , prominently features a mandolin .
Zinc is a chemical element with symbol Zn and atomic number 30 . It is the first element of group 12 of the periodic table . In some respects zinc is chemically similar to magnesium : its ion is of similar size and its only common oxidation state is +2 . Zinc is the 24th most abundant element in Earth 's crust and has five stable isotopes . The most common zinc ore is sphalerite ( zinc blende ) , a zinc sulfide mineral . The largest mineable amounts are found in Australia , Asia , and the United States . Zinc production includes froth flotation of the ore , roasting , and final extraction using electricity ( electrowinning ) .
The official policy became one of biological and cultural assimilation : " Eliminate the full-blood and permit the white admixture to half-castes and eventually the race will become white " . This led to different treatment for " black " and " half-caste " individuals , with lighter-skinned individuals targeted for removal from their families to be raised as " white " people , restricted from speaking their native language and practising traditional customs , a process now known as the Stolen Generation .
Football is the most popular national sport of Egypt . The Cairo Derby is one of the fiercest derbies in Africa , and the BBC picked it as one of the 7 toughest derbies in the world . Al Ahly is the most successful club of the 20th century in the African continent according to CAF , closely followed by their rivals Zamalek SC . Al Ahly was named in 2000 by the Confederation of African Football as the " African Club of the Century " . With twenty titles , Al Ahly is currently the world 's most successful club in terms of international trophies , surpassing Italy 's A.C. Milan and Argentina 's Boca Juniors , both having eighteen .
Many adaptations of the instrument have been done to cater to the special needs of Indian Carnatic music . In Indian classical music and Indian light music , the mandolin , which bears little resemblance to the European mandolin , is usually tuned E-B-E-B . As there is no concept of absolute pitch in Indian classical music , any convenient tuning maintaining these relative pitch intervals between the strings can be used . Another prevalent tuning with these intervals is C-G-C-G , which corresponds to Sa-Pa-Sa-Pa in the Indian carnatic classical music style . This tuning corresponds to the way violins are tuned for carnatic classical music . This type of mandolin is also used in Bhangra , dance music popular in Punjabi culture .
Luther taught that salvation and subsequently eternal life is not earned by good deeds but is received only as a free gift of God 's grace through faith in Jesus Christ as redeemer from sin . His theology challenged the authority and office of the Pope by teaching that the Bible is the only source of divinely revealed knowledge from God and opposed sacerdotalism by considering all baptized Christians to be a holy priesthood . Those who identify with these , and all of Luther 's wider teachings , are called Lutherans even though Luther insisted on Christian or Evangelical as the only acceptable names for individuals who professed Christ .
In July 2012 , Ancestry.com reported on historic and DNA research by its staff that discovered that Obama is likely a descendant through his mother of John Punch , considered by some historians to be the first African slave in the Virginia colony . An indentured servant , he was " bound for life " in 1640 after trying to escape . The story of him and his descendants is that of multi-racial America since it appeared he and his sons married or had unions with white women , likely indentured servants and working-class like them . Their multi-racial children were free because they were born to free English women . Over time , Obama 's line of the Bunch family ( as they became known ) were property owners and continued to " marry white " ; they became part of white society , likely by the early to mid-18th century .
As opposed to broadcasts of primetime series , CBS broadcast special episodes of its late night talk shows as its lead-out programs for Super Bowl 50 , beginning with a special episode of The Late Show with Stephen Colbert following the game . Following a break for late local programming , CBS also aired a special episode of The Late Late Show with James Corden .
UNFPA 's connection to China 's administration of forced abortions was refuted by investigations carried out by various US , UK , and UN teams sent to examine UNFPA activities in China . Specifically , a three-person U.S State Department fact-finding team was sent on a two-week tour throughout China . It wrote in a report to the State Department that it found " no evidence that UNFPA has supported or participated in the management of a program of coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization in China , " as has been charged by critics .
Cardinal priests are the most numerous of the three orders of cardinals in the Catholic Church , ranking above the cardinal deacons and below the cardinal bishops . Those who are named cardinal priests today are generally bishops of important dioceses throughout the world , though some hold Curial positions .

There are eleven Renaissance allegorical statues on public fountains in the Old Town . Nearly all the 16th century fountains , except the Zähringer fountain which was created by Hans Hiltbrand , are the work of the Fribourg master Hans Gieng . One of the more interesting fountains is the Kindlifresserbrunnen ( Bernese German : Child Eater Fountain but often translated Ogre Fountain ) which is claimed to represent a Jew , the Greek god Chronos or a Fastnacht figure that scares disobedient children .
Much of mandolin development revolved around the soundboard ( the top ) . Pre-mandolin instruments were quiet instruments , strung with as many as six courses of gut strings , and were plucked with the fingers or with a quill . However , modern instruments are louder—using four courses of metal strings , which exert more pressure than the gut strings . The modern soundboard is designed to withstand the pressure of metal strings that would break earlier instruments . The soundboard comes in many shapes—but generally round or teardrop-shaped , sometimes with scrolls or other projections . There is usually one or more sound holes in the soundboard , either round , oval , or shaped like a calligraphic F ( f-hole ) . A round or oval sound hole may be covered or bordered with decorative rosettes or purfling .
The Charaka Samhita , thought to have been written between 300 and 500 AD , mentions a metal which , when oxidized , produces pushpanjan , thought to be zinc oxide . Zinc mines at Zawar , near Udaipur in India , have been active since the Mauryan period . The smelting of metallic zinc here , however , appears to have begun around the 12th century AD . One estimate is that this location produced an estimated million tonnes of metallic zinc and zinc oxide from the 12th to 16th centuries . Another estimate gives a total production of 60,000 tonnes of metallic zinc over this period . The Rasaratna Samuccaya , written in approximately the 13th century AD , mentions two types of zinc-containing ores : one used for metal extraction and another used for medicinal purposes .
Since the 16th century , the city has had a bear pit , the Bärengraben , at the far end of the Nydeggbrücke to house its heraldic animals . The currently four bears are now kept in an open-air enclosure nearby , and two other young bears , a present by the Russian president , are kept in Dählhölzli zoo .
The city of Bern or Berne ( German : Bern , pronounced [ bɛrn ] ( listen ) ; French : Berne [ bɛʁn ] ; Italian : Berna [ ˈbɛrna ] ; Romansh : Berna [ ˈbɛrnɐ ] ( help·info ) ; Bernese German : Bärn [ b̥æːrn ] ) is the de facto capital of Switzerland , referred to by the Swiss as their ( e.g . in German ) Bundesstadt , or " federal city " . [ note 1 ] With a population of 140,634 ( November 2015 ) , Bern is the fifth most populous city in Switzerland . The Bern agglomeration , which includes 36 municipalities , had a population of 406,900 in 2014 . The metropolitan area had a population of 660,000 in 2000 . Bern is also the capital of the Canton of Bern , the second most populous of Switzerland 's cantons .
The Dean of the College of Cardinals in addition to such a titular church also receives the titular bishopric of Ostia , the primary suburbicarian see . Cardinals governing a particular Church retain that church .
Zinc metal is produced using extractive metallurgy . After grinding the ore , froth flotation , which selectively separates minerals from gangue by taking advantage of differences in their hydrophobicity , is used to get an ore concentrate . This concentrate consists of about 50 % zinc with the rest being sulfur ( 32 % ) , iron ( 13 % ) , and SiO 2 ( 5 % ) . The composition of this is normally zinc sulfide ( 80 % to 85 % ) , iron sulfide ( 7.0 % to 12 % ) , lead sulfide ( 3.0 % to 5.0 % ) silica ( 2.5 % to 3.5 % ) , and cadmium sulfide ( 0.35 % to 0.41 % ) .
In response , the EU decided to fill the gap left behind by the US under the Sandbaek report . According to its Annual Report for 2008 , the UNFPA received its funding mainly from European Governments : Of the total income of M845.3 M , $ 118 was donated by the Netherlands , $ 67 M by Sweden , $ 62 M by Norway , $ 54 M by Denmark , $ 53 M by the UK , $ 52 M by Spain , $ 19 M by Luxembourg . The European Commission donated further $ 36 M. The most important non-European donor State was Japan ( $ 36 M ) . The number of donors exceeded 180 in one year .
Some consider koshari ( a mixture of rice , lentils , and macaroni ) to be the national dish . Fried onions can be also added to koshari . In addition , ful medames ( mashed fava beans ) is one of the most popular dishes . Fava bean is also used in making falafel ( also known as " ta'meyya " ) , which may have originated in Egypt and spread to other parts of the Middle East . Garlic fried with coriander is added to mulukhiyya , a popular green soup made from finely chopped jute leaves , sometimes with chicken or rabbit .
In 1501 , at the age of 19 , he entered the University of Erfurt , which he later described as a beerhouse and whorehouse . He was made to wake at four every morning for what has been described as " a day of rote learning and often wearying spiritual exercises . " He received his master 's degree in 1505 .
Luther dedicated himself to the Augustinian order , devoting himself to fasting , long hours in prayer , pilgrimage , and frequent confession . Luther described this period of his life as one of deep spiritual despair . He said , " I lost touch with Christ the Savior and Comforter , and made of him the jailer and hangman of my poor soul . " Johann von Staupitz , his superior , pointed Luther 's mind away from continual reflection upon his sins toward the merits of Christ . He taught that true repentance does not involve self-inflicted penances and punishments but rather a change of heart .
The name of the metal was probably first documented by Paracelsus , a Swiss-born German alchemist , who referred to the metal as " zincum " or " zinken " in his book Liber Mineralium II , in the 16th century . The word is probably derived from the German zinke , and supposedly meant " tooth-like , pointed or jagged " ( metallic zinc crystals have a needle-like appearance ) . Zink could also imply " tin-like " because of its relation to German zinn meaning tin . Yet another possibility is that the word is derived from the Persian word سنگ seng meaning stone . The metal was also called Indian tin , tutanego , calamine , and spinter .
In Bern , about 50,418 or ( 39.2 % ) of the population have completed non-mandatory upper secondary education , and 24,311 or ( 18.9 % ) have completed additional higher education ( either university or a Fachhochschule ) . Of the 24,311 who completed tertiary schooling , 51.6 % were Swiss men , 33.0 % were Swiss women , 8.9 % were non-Swiss men and 6.5 % were non-Swiss women .
In 1986 , CBS sold its music publishing arm , CBS Songs , to Stephen Swid , Martin Bandier , and Charles Koppelman for $ 125 million making it the foundation of their SBK Entertainment .
Because of the acceptance of miscegenation , Brazil has avoided the binary polarization of society into black and white . In addition , it abolished slavery without a civil war . The bitter and sometimes violent racial tensions that have divided the US are notably absent in Brazil . According to the 2010 census , 6.7 % of Brazilians said they were black , compared with 6.2 % in 2000 , and 43.1 % said they were racially mixed , up from 38.5 % . In 2010 , Elio Ferreira de Araujo , Brazil 's minister for racial equality , attributed the increases to growing pride among his country 's black and indigenous communities .
On November 17 , 1987 , SCA acquired CBS Records , which hosted such acts as Michael Jackson , for US $ 2 billion . CBS Inc. , now CBS Corporation , retained the rights to the CBS name for music recordings but granted Sony a temporary license to use the CBS name . CBS Corporation founded a new CBS Records in 2006 , which is distributed by Sony through its RED subsidiary .
With 4:51 left in regulation , Carolina got the ball on their own 24-yard line with a chance to mount a game-winning drive , and soon faced 3rd-and-9 . On the next play , Miller stripped the ball away from Newton , and after several players dove for it , it took a long bounce backwards and was recovered by Ward , who returned it five yards to the Panthers 4-yard line . Although several players dove into the pile to attempt to recover it , Newton did not and his lack of aggression later earned him heavy criticism . Meanwhile , Denver 's offense was kept out of the end zone for three plays , but a holding penalty on cornerback Josh Norman gave the Broncos a new set of downs . Then Anderson scored on a 2-yard touchdown run and Manning completed a pass to Bennie Fowler for a 2-point conversion , giving Denver a 24–10 lead with 3:08 left and essentially putting the game away . Carolina had two more drives , but failed to get a first down on each one .
Numerous modern mandolin makers build instruments that largely replicate the Gibson F-5 Artist models built in the early 1920s under the supervision of Gibson acoustician Lloyd Loar . Original Loar-signed instruments are sought after and extremely valuable . Other makers from the Loar period and earlier include Lyon and Healy , Vega and Larson Brothers . Some notable modern American carved mandolin manufacturers include , in addition to Kay , Gibson , Weber , Monteleone and Collings . Mandolins from other countries include The Loar ( China ) , Santa , Rosa ( China ) , Michael Kelly ( Korea ) , Eastman ( China ) , Kentucky ( China ) , Heiden ( Canada ) , Gilchrist ( Australia ) and Morgan Monroe ( China ) .
In 2008 , the High Court in South Africa ruled that Chinese South Africans who were residents during the apartheid era ( and their descendants ) are to be reclassified as " Black people , " solely for the purposes of accessing affirmative action benefits , because they were also " disadvantaged " by racial discrimination . Chinese people who arrived in the country after the end of apartheid do not qualify for such benefits .
In 1839 Mariano Spada ( 1796 - 1872 ) , professor of theology at the Roman College of Saint Thomas , published Esame Critico sulla dottrina dell ’ Angelico Dottore S. Tommaso di Aquino circa il Peccato originale , relativamente alla Beatissima Vergine Maria [ A critical examination of the doctrine of St. Thomas Aquinas , the Angelic Doctor , regarding original sin with respect to the Most Blessed Virgin Mary ] , in which Aquinas is interpreted not as treating the question of the Immaculate Conception later formulated in the papal bull Ineffabilis Deus but rather the sanctification of the fetus within Mary 's womb . Spada furnished an interpretation whereby Pius IX was relieved of the problem of seeming to foster a doctrine not in agreement with the Aquinas ' teaching . Pope Pius IX would later appoint Spada Master of the Sacred Palace in 1867 .
Genetic studies have found significant African female-mediated gene flow in Arab communities in the Arabian Peninsula and neighboring countries , with an average of 38 % of maternal lineages in Yemen are of direct African descent , 16 % in Oman-Qatar , and 10 % in Saudi Arabia-United Arab Emirates .
American University economist George Ayittey accused the Arab government of Sudan of practicing acts of racism against black citizens . According to Ayittey , " In Sudan ... the Arabs monopolized power and excluded blacks – Arab apartheid . " Many African commentators joined Ayittey in accusing Sudan of practising Arab apartheid .
The new government drafted and implemented a constitution in 1923 based on a parliamentary system . Saad Zaghlul was popularly elected as Prime Minister of Egypt in 1924 . In 1936 , the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty was concluded . Continued instability due to remaining British influence and increasing political involvement by the king led to the dissolution of the parliament in a military coup d'état known as the 1952 Revolution . The Free Officers Movement forced King Farouk to abdicate in support of his son Fuad . British military presence in Egypt lasted until 1954 .
Critics of the Aeneid focus on a variety of issues . The tone of the poem as a whole is a particular matter of debate ; some see the poem as ultimately pessimistic and politically subversive to the Augustan regime , while others view it as a celebration of the new imperial dynasty . Virgil makes use of the symbolism of the Augustan regime , and some scholars see strong associations between Augustus and Aeneas , the one as founder and the other as re-founder of Rome . A strong teleology , or drive towards a climax , has been detected in the poem . The Aeneid is full of prophecies about the future of Rome , the deeds of Augustus , his ancestors , and famous Romans , and the Carthaginian Wars ; the shield of Aeneas even depicts Augustus ' victory at Actium against Mark Antony and Cleopatra VII in 31 BC . A further focus of study is the character of Aeneas . As the protagonist of the poem , Aeneas seems to waver constantly between his emotions and commitment to his prophetic duty to found Rome ; critics note the breakdown of Aeneas ' emotional control in the last sections of the poem where the " pious " and " righteous " Aeneas mercilessly slaughters Turnus .
The Georgics ' tone wavers between optimism and pessimism , sparking critical debate on the poet 's intentions , but the work lays the foundations for later didactic poetry . Virgil and Maecenas are said to have taken turns reading the Georgics to Octavian upon his return from defeating Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC .
Luther had published his German translation of the New Testament in 1522 , and he and his collaborators completed the translation of the Old Testament in 1534 , when the whole Bible was published . He continued to work on refining the translation until the end of his life . Others had translated the Bible into German , but Luther tailored his translation to his own doctrine . When he was criticised for inserting the word " alone " after " faith " in Romans 3:28 , he replied in part : " [ T ] he text itself and the meaning of St. Paul urgently require and demand it . For in that very passage he is dealing with the main point of Christian doctrine , namely , that we are justified by faith in Christ without any works of the Law . ... But when works are so completely cut away – and that must mean that faith alone justifies – whoever would speak plainly and clearly about this cutting away of works will have to say , 'Faith alone justifies us , and not works ' . "
In March 2010 , Sony Corp has partnered with The Michael Jackson Company with a contract of more than $ 250 million , the largest deal in recorded music history .
The Aeneid is widely considered Virgil 's finest work and one of the most important poems in the history of western literature . Virgil worked on the Aeneid during the last eleven years of his life ( 29–19 BC ) , commissioned , according to Propertius , by Augustus . The epic poem consists of 12 books in dactylic hexameter verse which describe the journey of Aeneas , a warrior fleeing the sack of Troy , to Italy , his battle with the Italian prince Turnus , and the foundation of a city from which Rome would emerge . The Aeneid 's first six books describe the journey of Aeneas from Troy to Rome . Virgil made use of several models in the composition of his epic ; Homer , the preeminent author of classical epic , is everywhere present , but Virgil also makes special use of the Latin poet Ennius and the Hellenistic poet Apollonius of Rhodes among the various other writers to which he alludes . Although the Aeneid casts itself firmly into the epic mode , it often seeks to expand the genre by including elements of other genres such as tragedy and aetiological poetry . Ancient commentators noted that Virgil seems to divide the Aeneid into two sections based on the poetry of Homer ; the first six books were viewed as employing the Odyssey as a model while the last six were connected to the Iliad .
About 150,000 East African and black people live in Israel , amounting to just over 2 % of the nation 's population . The vast majority of these , some 120,000 , are Beta Israel , most of whom are recent immigrants who came during the 1980s and 1990s from Ethiopia . In addition , Israel is home to over 5,000 members of the African Hebrew Israelites of Jerusalem movement that are descendants of African Americans who emigrated to Israel in the 20th century , and who reside mainly in a distinct neighborhood in the Negev town of Dimona . Unknown numbers of black converts to Judaism reside in Israel , most of them converts from the United Kingdom , Canada , and the United States .
A mandolin ( Italian : mandolino pronounced [ mandoˈliːno ] ; literally " small mandola " ) is a musical instrument in the lute family and is usually plucked with a plectrum or " pick " . It commonly has four courses of doubled metal strings tuned in unison ( 8 strings ) , although five ( 10 strings ) and six ( 12 strings ) course versions also exist . The courses are normally tuned in a succession of perfect fifths . It is the soprano member of a family that includes the mandola , octave mandolin , mandocello and mandobass .

Symptoms of mild zinc deficiency are diverse . Clinical outcomes include depressed growth , diarrhea , impotence and delayed sexual maturation , alopecia , eye and skin lesions , impaired appetite , altered cognition , impaired host defense properties , defects in carbohydrate utilization , and reproductive teratogenesis . Mild zinc deficiency depresses immunity , although excessive zinc does also . Animals with a diet deficient in zinc require twice as much food in order to attain the same weight gain as animals given sufficient zinc .

From 1510 to 1520 , Luther lectured on the Psalms , the books of Hebrews , Romans , and Galatians . As he studied these portions of the Bible , he came to view the use of terms such as penance and righteousness by the Catholic Church in new ways . He became convinced that the church was corrupt in its ways and had lost sight of what he saw as several of the central truths of Christianity . The most important for Luther was the doctrine of justification – God 's act of declaring a sinner righteous – by faith alone through God 's grace . He began to teach that salvation or redemption is a gift of God 's grace , attainable only through faith in Jesus as the Messiah . " This one and firm rock , which we call the doctrine of justification , " he wrote , " is the chief article of the whole Christian doctrine , which comprehends the understanding of all godliness . "
Distinctive and self-identified black communities have been reported in countries such as Iraq , with a reported 1.2 million black people , and they attest to a history of discrimination . African-Iraquis have sought minority status from the government , which would reserve some seats in Parliament for representatives of their population . According to Alamin M. Mazrui et al. , generally in the Arabian Peninsula and neighboring countries , most of those of visible African descent are still classified and identify as Arab , not black .
Peyton Manning became the first quarterback ever to lead two different teams to multiple Super Bowls . He is also the oldest quarterback ever to play in a Super Bowl at age 39 . The past record was held by John Elway , who led the Broncos to victory in Super Bowl XXXIII at age 38 and is currently Denver 's Executive Vice President of Football Operations and General Manager .
Luther wrote about the Jews throughout his career , though only a few of his works dealt with them directly . Luther rarely encountered Jews during his life , but his attitudes reflected a theological and cultural tradition which saw Jews as a rejected people guilty of the murder of Christ , and he lived within a local community that had expelled Jews some ninety years earlier . He considered the Jews blasphemers and liars because they rejected the divinity of Jesus , whereas Christians believed Jesus was the Messiah . But Luther believed that all human beings who set themselves against God were equally guilty . As early as 1516 , he wrote that many people " are proud with marvelous stupidity when they call the Jews dogs , evildoers , or whatever they like , while they too , and equally , do not realize who or what they are in the sight of God " . In 1523 , Luther advised kindness toward the Jews in That Jesus Christ was Born a Jew and also aimed to convert them to Christianity . When his efforts at conversion failed , he grew increasingly bitter toward them . In his 2010 book Bonhoeffer : Pastor , Martyr , Prophet , Spy , Christian author Eric Metaxas claimed that Luther 's attitude towards Jews " unraveled along with his health . "
The House of Representatives , whose members are elected to serve five-year terms , specialises in legislation . Elections were last held between November 2011 and January 2012 which was later dissolved . The next parliamentary election will be held within 6 months of the constitution 's ratification on 18 January 2014 . Originally , the parliament was to be formed before the president was elected , but interim president Adly Mansour pushed the date . The Egyptian presidential election , 2014 , took place on 26–28 May 2014 . Official figures showed a turnout of 25,578,233 or 47.5 % , with Abdel Fattah el-Sisi winning with 23.78 million votes , or 96.91 % compared to 757,511 ( 3.09 % ) for Hamdeen Sabahi .
To fill this gap in the literature , mandolin orchestras have traditionally played many arrangements of music written for regular orchestras or other ensembles . Some players have sought out contemporary composers to solicit new works . Traditional mandolin orchestras remain especially popular in Japan and Germany , but also exist throughout the United States , Europe and the rest of the world . They perform works composed for mandolin family instruments , or re-orchestrations of traditional pieces . The structure of a contemporary traditional mandolin orchestra consists of : first and second mandolins , mandolas ( either octave mandolas , tuned an octave below the mandolin , or tenor mandolas , tuned like the viola ) , mandocellos ( tuned like the cello ) , and bass instruments ( conventional string bass or , rarely , mandobasses ) . Smaller ensembles , such as quartets composed of two mandolins , mandola , and mandocello , may also be found .
Several dozen radioisotopes have been characterized . 65Zn , which has a half-life of 243.66 days , is the most long-lived radioisotope , followed by 72Zn with a half-life of 46.5 hours . Zinc has 10 nuclear isomers . 69mZn has the longest half-life , 13.76 h. The superscript m indicates a metastable isotope . The nucleus of a metastable isotope is in an excited state and will return to the ground state by emitting a photon in the form of a gamma ray . 61Zn has three excited states and 73Zn has two . The isotopes 65Zn , 71Zn , 77Zn and 78Zn each have only one excited state .
The flagship stations of each station in the markets of each team will carry their local play-by-play calls . In Denver , KOA ( 850 AM ) and KRFX ( 103.5 FM ) will carry the game , with Dave Logan on play-by-play and Ed McCaffrey on color commentary . In North Carolina , WBT ( 1110 AM ) will carry the game , with Mick Mixon on play-by-play and Eugene Robinson and Jim Szoke on color commentary . WBT will also simulcast the game on its sister station WBT-FM ( 99.3 FM ) , which is based in Chester , South Carolina . As KOA and WBT are both clear-channel stations , the local broadcasts will be audible over much of the western United States after sunset ( for Denver ) and the eastern United States throughout the game ( for Carolina ) . In accordance with contractual rules , the rest of the stations in the Broncos and Panthers radio networks will either carry the Westwood One feed or not carry the game at all .
In accordance with tradition , they sign by placing the title " Cardinal " ( abbreviated Card . ) after their personal name and before their surname as , for instance , " John Card ( inal ) Doe " or , in Latin , " Ioannes Card ( inalis ) Cognomen " . Some writers , such as James-Charles Noonan , hold that , in the case of cardinals , the form used for signatures should be used also when referring to them in English . Official sources such as the Archdiocese of Milwaukee and Catholic News Service say that the correct form for referring to a cardinal in English is normally as " Cardinal [ First name ] [ Surname ] " . This is the rule given also in stylebooks not associated with the Catholic Church . This style is also generally followed on the websites of the Holy See and episcopal conferences . Oriental Patriarchs who are created Cardinals customarily use " Sanctae Ecclesiae Cardinalis " as their full title , probably because they do not belong to the Roman clergy .
Due to the often political and cultural contours of blackness in the United States , the notion of blackness can also be extended to non-black people . Toni Morrison once described Bill Clinton as the first black President of the United States , because , as she put it , he displayed " almost every trope of blackness " . Christopher Hitchens was offended by the notion of Clinton as the first black president , noting , " Mr Clinton , according to Toni Morrison , the Nobel Prize-winning novelist , is our first black President , the first to come from the broken home , the alcoholic mother , the under-the-bridge shadows of our ranking systems . Thus , we may have lost the mystical power to divine diabolism , but we can still divine blackness by the following symptoms : broken homes , alcoholic mothers , under-the-bridge habits and ( presumable from the rest of [ Arthur ] Miller 's senescent musings ) the tendency to sexual predation and to shameless perjury about same . " Some black activists were also offended , claiming that Clinton used his knowledge of black culture to exploit black people for political gain as no other president had before , while not serving black interests . They cite the lack of action during the Rwandan Genocide and his welfare reform , which Larry Roberts said had led to the worst child poverty since the 1960s . Others cited that the number of black people in jail increased during his administration .
In the year 1563 the influential Ecumenical Council of Trent , headed by Pope Pius IV , wrote about the importance of selecting good Cardinals . According to this historic council " nothing is more necessary to the Church of God than that the holy Roman pontiff apply that solicitude which by the duty of his office he owes the universal Church in a very special way by associating with himself as cardinals the most select persons only , and appoint to each church most eminently upright and competent shepherds ; and this the more so , because our Lord Jesus Christ will require at his hands the blood of the sheep of Christ that perish through the evil government of shepherds who are negligent and forgetful of their office . "
The US racial or ethnic classification " black " refers to people with all possible kinds of skin pigmentation , from the darkest through to the very lightest skin colors , including albinos , if they are believed by others to have West African ancestry ( in any discernible percentage ) , or to exhibit cultural traits associated with being " African American " . As a result , in the United States the term " black people " is not an indicator of skin color or ethnic origin but is instead a socially based racial classification related to being African American , with a family history associated with institutionalized slavery . Relatively dark-skinned people can be classified as white if they fulfill other social criteria of " whiteness " , and relatively light-skinned people can be classified as black if they fulfill the social criteria for " blackness " in a particular setting .
On Carolina 's next possession fullback Mike Tolbert lost a fumble while being tackled by safety Darian Stewart , which linebacker Danny Trevathan recovered on the Broncos 40-yard line . However , the Panthers soon took the ball back when defensive end Kony Ealy tipped a Manning pass to himself and then intercepted it , returning the ball 19 yards to the Panthers 39-yard line with 1:55 left on the clock . The Panthers could not gain any yards with their possession and had to punt . After a Denver punt , Carolina drove to the Broncos 45-yard line . But with 11 seconds left , Newton was sacked by DeMarcus Ware as time expired in the half .
Egypt 's economy depends mainly on agriculture , media , petroleum imports , natural gas , and tourism ; there are also more than three million Egyptians working abroad , mainly in Saudi Arabia , the Persian Gulf and Europe . The completion of the Aswan High Dam in 1970 and the resultant Lake Nasser have altered the time-honored place of the Nile River in the agriculture and ecology of Egypt . A rapidly growing population , limited arable land , and dependence on the Nile all continue to overtax resources and stress the economy .
On December 28 , 2015 , ESPN Deportes announced that they had reached an agreement with CBS and the NFL to be the exclusive Spanish-language broadcaster of the game , marking the third dedicated Spanish-language broadcast of the Super Bowl . Unlike NBC and Fox , CBS does not have a Spanish-language outlet of its own that could broadcast the game ( though per league policy , a separate Spanish play-by-play call was carried on CBS 's second audio program channel for over-the-air viewers ) . The game was called by ESPN Deportes ' Monday Night Football commentary crew of Alvaro Martin and Raul Allegre , and sideline reporter John Sutcliffe . ESPN Deportes broadcast pre-game and post-game coverage , while Martin , Allegre , and Sutcliffe contributed English-language reports for ESPN 's SportsCenter and Mike & Mike .
CBS provided digital streams of the game via CBSSports.com , and the CBS Sports apps on tablets , Windows 10 , Xbox One and other digital media players ( such as Chromecast and Roku ) . Due to Verizon Communications exclusivity , streaming on smartphones was only provided to Verizon Wireless customers via the NFL Mobile service . The ESPN Deportes Spanish broadcast was made available through WatchESPN .
Without Luther 's backing for the uprising , many rebels laid down their weapons ; others felt betrayed . Their defeat by the Swabian League at the Battle of Frankenhausen on 15 May 1525 , followed by Müntzer 's execution , brought the revolutionary stage of the Reformation to a close . Thereafter , radicalism found a refuge in the anabaptist movement and other religious movements , while Luther 's Reformation flourished under the wing of the secular powers .
Although the self is distinct from identity , the literature of self-psychology can offer some insight into how identity is maintained ( Cote & Levin 2002 , p. 24 ) . From the vantage point of self-psychology , there are two areas of interest : the processes by which a self is formed ( the " I " ) , and the actual content of the schemata which compose the self-concept ( the " Me " ) . In the latter field , theorists have shown interest in relating the self-concept to self-esteem , the differences between complex and simple ways of organizing self-knowledge , and the links between those organizing principles and the processing of information ( Cote & Levin 2002 ) .
At Maecenas ' insistence ( according to the tradition ) Virgil spent the ensuing years ( perhaps 37–29 BC ) on the long didactic hexameter poem called the Georgics ( from Greek , " On Working the Earth " ) which he dedicated to Maecenas . The ostensible theme of the Georgics is instruction in the methods of running a farm . In handling this theme , Virgil follows in the didactic ( " how to " ) tradition of the Greek poet Hesiod 's Works and Days and several works of the later Hellenistic poets . The four books of the Georgics focus respectively on raising crops and trees ( 1 and 2 ) , livestock and horses ( 3 ) , and beekeeping and the qualities of bees ( 4 ) . Well-known passages include the beloved Laus Italiae of Book 2 , the prologue description of the temple in Book 3 , and the description of the plague at the end of Book 3 . Book 4 concludes with a long mythological narrative , in the form of an epyllion which describes vividly the discovery of beekeeping by Aristaeus and the story of Orpheus ' journey to the underworld . Ancient scholars , such as Servius , conjectured that the Aristaeus episode replaced , at the emperor 's request , a long section in praise of Virgil 's friend , the poet Gallus , who was disgraced by Augustus , and who committed suicide in 26 BC .
On 28 February 1476 , Pope Sixtus IV , authorized those dioceses that wished to introduce the feast to do so , and introduced it to his own diocese of Rome in 1477 , with a specially composed Mass and Office of the feast . With his bull Cum praeexcelsa of 28 February 1477 , in which he referred to the feast as that of the Conception of Mary , without using the word " Immaculate " , he granted indulgences to those who would participate in the specially composed Mass or Office on the feast itself or during its octave , and he used the word " immaculate " of Mary , but applied instead the adjective " miraculous " to her conception . On 4 September 1483 , referring to the feast as that of " the Conception of Immaculate Mary ever Virgin " , he condemned both those who called it mortally sinful and heretical to hold that the " glorious and immaculate mother of God was conceived without the stain of original sin " and those who called it mortally sinful and heretical to hold that " the glorious Virgin Mary was conceived with original sin " , since , he said , " up to this time there has been no decision made by the Roman Church and the Apostolic See . " This decree was reaffirmed by the Council of Trent .
In addition to the Vince Lombardi Trophy that all Super Bowl champions receive , the winner of Super Bowl 50 will also receive a large , 18-karat gold-plated " 50 " . Each digit will weigh 33 lb ( 15 kg ) for a total of 66 lb ( 30 kg ) . Like the Lombardi Trophy , the " 50 " will be designed by Tiffany & Co .
Other than by appearance , " Coloureds " can usually be distinguished from " Blacks " by language . Most speak Afrikaans or English as a first language , as opposed to Bantu languages such as Zulu or Xhosa . They also tend to have more European-sounding names than Bantu names .
In the early 1970s the Rolling Stones developed their hard rock sound with Exile on Main St. ( 1972 ) . Initially receiving mixed reviews , according to critic Steve Erlewine it is now " generally regarded as the Rolling Stones ' finest album " . They continued to pursue the riff-heavy sound on albums including It 's Only Rock 'n ' Roll ( 1974 ) and Black and Blue ( 1976 ) . Led Zeppelin began to mix elements of world and folk music into their hard rock from Led Zeppelin III ( 1970 ) and Led Zeppelin IV ( 1971 ) . The latter included the track " Stairway to Heaven " , which would become the most played song in the history of album-oriented radio . Deep Purple continued to define hard rock , particularly with their album Machine Head ( 1972 ) , which included the tracks " Highway Star " and " Smoke on the Water " . In 1975 guitarist Ritchie Blackmore left , going on to form Rainbow and after the break-up of the band the next year , vocalist David Coverdale formed Whitesnake . 1970 saw The Who release Live at Leeds , often seen as the archetypal hard rock live album , and the following year they released their highly acclaimed album Who 's Next , which mixed heavy rock with extensive use of synthesizers . Subsequent albums , including Quadrophenia ( 1973 ) , built on this sound before Who Are You ( 1978 ) , their last album before the death of pioneering rock drummer Keith Moon later that year .
In the United States , the game was televised by CBS , as part of a cycle between the three main broadcast television partners of the NFL . The network 's lead broadcast team of Jim Nantz and Phil Simms called the contest , with Tracy Wolfson and Evan Washburn on the sidelines . CBS introduced new features during the telecast , including pylon cameras and microphones along with EyeVision 360—an array of 36 cameras along the upper deck that can be used to provide a 360-degree view of plays and " bullet time " effects . ( An earlier version of EyeVision was last used in Super Bowl XXXV ; for Super Bowl 50 , the cameras were upgraded to 5K resolution . )
Much of mandolin development revolved around the soundboard ( the top ) . Pre-mandolin instruments were quiet instruments , strung with as many as six courses of gut strings , and were plucked with the fingers or with a quill . However , modern instruments are louder—using four courses of metal strings , which exert more pressure than the gut strings . The modern soundboard is designed to withstand the pressure of metal strings that would break earlier instruments . The soundboard comes in many shapes—but generally round or teardrop-shaped , sometimes with scrolls or other projections . There is usually one or more sound holes in the soundboard , either round , oval , or shaped like a calligraphic F ( f-hole ) . A round or oval sound hole may be covered or bordered with decorative rosettes or purfling .
After the First World War , however , it became apparent that the number of mixed-race people was growing at a faster rate than the white population , and by 1930 fear of the " half-caste menace " undermining the White Australia ideal from within was being taken as a serious concern . Dr. Cecil Cook , the Northern Territory Protector of Natives , noted that :
The early Christian philosophy of Augustine of Hippo was heavily influenced by Plato . A key change brought about by Christian thought was the moderatation of the Stoicism and theory of justice of the Roman world , as well emphasis on the role of the state in applying mercy as a moral example . Augustine also preached that one was not a member of his or her city , but was either a citizen of the City of God ( Civitas Dei ) or the City of Man ( Civitas Terrena ) . Augustine 's City of God is an influential work of this period that attacked the thesis , held by many Christian Romans , that the Christian view could be realized on Earth .
The relative reactivity of zinc and its ability to attract oxidation to itself makes it an efficient sacrificial anode in cathodic protection ( CP ) . For example , cathodic protection of a buried pipeline can be achieved by connecting anodes made from zinc to the pipe . Zinc acts as the anode ( negative terminus ) by slowly corroding away as it passes electric current to the steel pipeline . [ note 2 ] Zinc is also used to cathodically protect metals that are exposed to sea water from corrosion . A zinc disc attached to a ship 's iron rudder will slowly corrode , whereas the rudder stays unattacked . Other similar uses include a plug of zinc attached to a propeller or the metal protective guard for the keel of the ship .
Luther 's writings circulated widely , reaching France , England , and Italy as early as 1519 . Students thronged to Wittenberg to hear Luther speak . He published a short commentary on Galatians and his Work on the Psalms . This early part of Luther 's career was one of his most creative and productive . Three of his best-known works were published in 1520 : To the Christian Nobility of the German Nation , On the Babylonian Captivity of the Church , and On the Freedom of a Christian .
Various gold-themed promotions and initiatives were held throughout the 2015 NFL season to tie into the " Golden Super Bowl " ; gold-tinted logos were implemented across the NFL 's properties and painted on fields , the numbering of the 50-yard line on fields was colored gold , and beginning on week 7 , all sideline jackets and hats featured gold-trimmed logos . Gold footballs were given to each high school that has had a player or coach appear in the Super Bowl , and " homecoming " events were also held by Super Bowl-winning teams at games .
In the Colonial America of 1619 , John Rolfe used negars in describing the slaves who were captured from West Africa and then shipped to the Virginia colony . Later American English spellings , neger and neggar , prevailed in a northern colony , New York under the Dutch , and in metropolitan Philadelphia 's Moravian and Pennsylvania Dutch communities ; the African Burial Ground in New York City originally was known by the Dutch name " Begraafplaats van de Neger " ( Cemetery of the Negro ) ; an early US occurrence of neger in Rhode Island , dates from 1625 . Thomas Jefferson also used the term " black " in his Notes on the State of Virginia in allusion to the slave populations .
In previous times , at the consistory at which the pope named a new cardinal , he would bestow upon him a distinctive wide-brimmed hat called a galero . This custom was discontinued in 1969 and the investiture now takes place with the scarlet biretta . In ecclesiastical heraldry , however , the scarlet galero is still displayed on the cardinal 's coat of arms . Cardinals had the right to display the galero in their cathedral , and when a cardinal died , it would be suspended from the ceiling above his tomb . Some cardinals will still have a galero made , even though it is not officially part of their apparel . [ citation needed ]
In the 18th century , the Moroccan Sultan Moulay Ismail " the Bloodthirsty " ( 1672–1727 ) raised a corps of 150,000 black slaves , called his Black Guard , who coerced the country into submission .
In late November 2015 , reports surfaced stating that " multiple acts " would perform during the halftime show . On December 3 , the league confirmed that the show would be headlined by the British rock group Coldplay . On January 7 , 2016 , Pepsi confirmed to the Associated Press that Beyoncé , who headlined the Super Bowl XLVII halftime show and collaborated with Coldplay on the single " Hymn for the Weekend " , would be making an appearance . Bruno Mars , who headlined the Super Bowl XLVIII halftime show , and Mark Ronson also performed .
Doug Morris , who was head of Warner Music Group , then Universal Music , became chairman and CEO of the company on July 1 , 2011 . Sony Music underwent a restructuring after Morris ' arrival . He was joined by L.A. Reid , who became the chairman and CEO of Epic Records . Under Reid , multiple artists from the Jive half of the former RCA/Jive Label Group moved to Epic . Peter Edge became the new CEO of the RCA Records unit . The RCA Music Group closed down Arista , J Records and Jive Records in October 2011 , with the artists from those labels being moved to RCA Records .

The Panthers beat the Seattle Seahawks in the divisional round , running up a 31–0 halftime lead and then holding off a furious second half comeback attempt to win 31–24 , avenging their elimination from a year earlier . The Panthers then blew out the Arizona Cardinals in the NFC Championship Game , 49–15 , racking up 487 yards and forcing seven turnovers .
Established bands made something of a comeback in the mid-1980s . After an 8-year separation , Deep Purple returned with the classic Machine Head line-up to produce Perfect Strangers ( 1984 ) , which reached number five in the UK , hit the top five in five other countries , and was a platinum-seller in the US . After somewhat slower sales of its fourth album , Fair Warning , Van Halen rebounded with the Top 3 album Diver Down in 1982 , then reached their commercial pinnacle with 1984 . It reached number two on the Billboard album chart and provided the track " Jump " , which reached number one on the singles chart and remained there for several weeks . Heart , after floundering during the first half of the decade , made a comeback with their eponymous ninth studio album which hit number one and contained four Top 10 singles including their first number one hit . The new medium of video channels was used with considerable success by bands formed in previous decades . Among the first were ZZ Top , who mixed hard blues rock with new wave music to produce a series of highly successful singles , beginning with " Gim me All Your Lovin ' " ( 1983 ) , which helped their albums Eliminator ( 1983 ) and Afterburner ( 1985 ) achieve diamond and multi-platinum status respectively . Others found renewed success in the singles charts with power ballads , including REO Speedwagon with " Keep on Loving You " ( 1980 ) and " Ca n't Fight This Feeling " ( 1984 ) , Journey with " Do n't Stop Believin ' " ( 1981 ) and " Open Arms " ( 1982 ) , Foreigner 's " I Want to Know What Love Is " , Scorpions ' " Still Loving You " ( both from 1984 ) , Heart ’ s " What About Love " ( 1985 ) and " These Dreams " ( 1986 ) , and Boston 's " Amanda " ( 1986 ) .
The agreements include fixed annual carriage fees of £30m for the channels with both channel suppliers able to secure additional capped payments if their channels meet certain performance-related targets . Currently there is no indication as to whether the new deal includes the additional Video On Demand and High Definition content which had previously been offered by BSkyB . As part of the agreements , both BSkyB and Virgin Media agreed to terminate all High Court proceedings against each other relating to the carriage of their respective basic channels .
In 1983 the historic old town in the centre of Bern became a UNESCO World Heritage Site . Bern is ranked among the world ’ s top ten cities for the best quality of life ( 2010 ) .
In the Late Empire and Middle Ages Vergilius was spelled Virgilius . Two explanations are commonly given for this alteration . One deduces a false etymology associated with the word virgo ( " maiden " in Latin ) due to Virgil 's excessive , " maiden " -like modesty . Alternatively , some argue that Vergilius was altered to Virgilius by analogy with the Latin virga ( " wand " ) due to the magical or prophetic powers attributed to Virgil in the Middle Ages ( this explanation is found in only a handful of manuscripts , however , and was probably not widespread ) . In Norman schools ( following the French practice ) , the habit was to anglicize Latin names by dropping their Latin endings , hence Virgil . In the 19th century , some German-trained classicists in the United States suggested modification to Vergil , as it is closer to his original name , and is also the traditional German spelling . [ citation needed ] Modern usage permits both , though the Oxford guide to style recommends Vergilius to avoid confusion with the 8th-century grammarian Virgilius Maro Grammaticus . Some post-Renaissance writers liked to affect the sobriquet " The Swan of Mantua " . [ citation needed ]
Partly because of low sanitation coverage about 17,000 children die each year because of diarrhoea . Another challenge is low cost recovery due to water tariffs that are among the lowest in the world . This in turn requires government subsidies even for operating costs , a situation that has been aggravated by salary increases without tariff increases after the Arab Spring . Poor operation of facilities , such as water and wastewater treatment plants , as well as limited government accountability and transparency , are also issues .
It seems to have been St Bernard of Clairvaux who , in the 12th century , explicitly raised the question of the Immaculate Conception . A feast of the Conception of the Blessed Virgin had already begun to be celebrated in some churches of the West . St Bernard blames the canons of the metropolitan church of Lyon for instituting such a festival without the permission of the Holy See . In doing so , he takes occasion to repudiate altogether the view that the conception of Mary was sinless . It is doubtful , however , whether he was using the term " conception " in the same sense in which it is used in the definition of Pope Pius IX . Bernard would seem to have been speaking of conception in the active sense of the mother 's cooperation , for in his argument he says : " How can there be absence of sin where there is concupiscence ( libido ) ? " and stronger expressions follow , showing that he is speaking of the mother and not of the child .
In accordance with tradition , they sign by placing the title " Cardinal " ( abbreviated Card . ) after their personal name and before their surname as , for instance , " John Card ( inal ) Doe " or , in Latin , " Ioannes Card ( inalis ) Cognomen " . Some writers , such as James-Charles Noonan , hold that , in the case of cardinals , the form used for signatures should be used also when referring to them in English . Official sources such as the Archdiocese of Milwaukee and Catholic News Service say that the correct form for referring to a cardinal in English is normally as " Cardinal [ First name ] [ Surname ] " . This is the rule given also in stylebooks not associated with the Catholic Church . This style is also generally followed on the websites of the Holy See and episcopal conferences . Oriental Patriarchs who are created Cardinals customarily use " Sanctae Ecclesiae Cardinalis " as their full title , probably because they do not belong to the Roman clergy .
Popular opinion remained firmly behind the celebration of Mary 's conception . In 1439 , the Council of Basel , which is not reckoned an ecumenical council , stated that belief in the immaculate conception of Mary is in accord with the Catholic faith . By the end of the 15th century the belief was widely professed and taught in many theological faculties , but such was the influence of the Dominicans , and the weight of the arguments of Thomas Aquinas ( who had been canonised in 1323 and declared " Doctor Angelicus " of the Church in 1567 ) that the Council of Trent ( 1545–63 ) —which might have been expected to affirm the doctrine—instead declined to take a position .
The Super Bowl 50 Host Committee has vowed to be " the most giving Super Bowl ever " , and will dedicate 25 percent of all money it raises for philanthropic causes in the Bay Area . The committee created the 50 fund as its philanthropic initiative and focuses on providing grants to aid with youth development , community investment and sustainable environments .
At the time of the fall of the Egyptian monarchy in the early 1950s , less than half a million Egyptians were considered upper class and rich , four million middle class and 17 million lower class and poor . Fewer than half of all primary-school-age children attended school , most of them being boys . Nasser 's policies changed this . Land reform and distribution , the dramatic growth in university education , and government support to national industries greatly improved social mobility and flattened the social curve . From academic year 1953-54 through 1965-66 , overall public school enrolments more than doubled . Millions of previously poor Egyptians , through education and jobs in the public sector , joined the middle class . Doctors , engineers , teachers , lawyers , journalists , constituted the bulk of the swelling middle class in Egypt under Nasser . During the 1960s , the Egyptian economy went from sluggish to the verge of collapse , the society became less free , and Nasser 's appeal waned considerably .
The term cardinal at one time applied to any priest permanently assigned or incardinated to a church , or specifically to the senior priest of an important church , based on the Latin cardo ( hinge ) , meaning " principal " or " chief " . The term was applied in this sense as early as the ninth century to the priests of the tituli ( parishes ) of the diocese of Rome . The Church of England retains an instance of this origin of the title , which is held by the two senior members of the College of Minor Canons of St Paul 's Cathedral .
Zinc is an essential mineral perceived by the public today as being of " exceptional biologic and public health importance " , especially regarding prenatal and postnatal development . Zinc deficiency affects about two billion people in the developing world and is associated with many diseases . In children it causes growth retardation , delayed sexual maturation , infection susceptibility , and diarrhea . Enzymes with a zinc atom in the reactive center are widespread in biochemistry , such as alcohol dehydrogenase in humans . Consumption of excess zinc can cause ataxia , lethargy and copper deficiency .
Luther 's Small Catechism proved especially effective in helping parents teach their children ; likewise the Larger Catechism was effective for pastors . Using the German vernacular , they expressed the Apostles ' Creed in simpler , more personal , Trinitarian language . He rewrote each article of the Creed to express the character of the Father , the Son , or the Holy Spirit . Luther 's goal was to enable the catechumens to see themselves as a personal object of the work of the three persons of the Trinity , each of which works in the catechumen 's life . That is , Luther depicted the Trinity not as a doctrine to be learned , but as persons to be known . The Father creates , the Son redeems , and the Spirit sanctifies , a divine unity with separate personalities . Salvation originates with the Father and draws the believer to the Father . Luther 's treatment of the Apostles ' Creed must be understood in the context of the Decalogue ( the Ten Commandments ) and the Lord 's Prayer , which are also part of the Lutheran catechical teaching .
BSkyB has no veto over the presence of channels on their EPG , with open access being an enforced part of their operating licence from Ofcom . Any channel which can get carriage on a suitable beam of a satellite at 28° East is entitled to access to BSkyB 's EPG for a fee , ranging from £15–100,000 . Third-party channels which opt for encryption receive discounts ranging from reduced price to free EPG entries , free carriage on a BSkyB leased transponder , or actual payment for being carried . However , even in this case , BSkyB does not carry any control over the channel 's content or carriage issues such as picture quality .
The concept of race in Brazil is complex . A Brazilian child was never automatically identified with the racial type of one or both of his or her parents , nor were there only two categories to choose from . Between an individual of unmixed West African descent and a very light mulatto individual , more than a dozen racial categories were acknowledged , based on various combinations of hair color , hair texture , eye color , and skin color . These types grade into each other like the colors of the spectrum , and no one category stands significantly isolated from the rest . In Brazil , people are classified by appearance , not heredity .
In 1507 , he was ordained to the priesthood , and in 1508 , von Staupitz , first dean of the newly founded University of Wittenberg , sent for Luther , to teach theology . He received a bachelor 's degree in Biblical studies on 9 March 1508 , and another bachelor 's degree in the Sentences by Peter Lombard in 1509 .
At a general level , self-psychology is compelled to investigate the question of how the personal self relates to the social environment . To the extent that these theories place themselves in the tradition of " psychological " social psychology , they focus on explaining an individual 's actions within a group in terms of mental events and states . However , some " sociological " social psychology theories go further by attempting to deal with the issue of identity at both the levels of individual cognition and of collective behavior .
In his 1805 mandolin method , Anweisung die Mandoline von selbst zu erlernen nebst einigen Uebungsstucken von Bortolazzi , Bartolomeo Bortolazzi popularised the Cremonese mandolin , which had four single-strings and a fixed bridge , to which the strings were attached . Bortolazzi said in this book that the new wire strung mandolins were uncomfortable to play , when compared with the gut-string instruments . Also , he felt they had a " less pleasing ... hard , zither-like tone " as compared to the gut string 's " softer , full-singing tone . " He favored the four single strings of the Cremonese instrument , which were tuned the same as the Neapolitan .
Dante made Virgil his guide in Hell and the greater part of Purgatory in The Divine Comedy . Dante also mentions Virgil in De vulgari eloquentia , along with Ovid , Lucan and Statius , as one of the four regulati poetae ( ii , vi , 7 ) .
Luther dedicated himself to the Augustinian order , devoting himself to fasting , long hours in prayer , pilgrimage , and frequent confession . Luther described this period of his life as one of deep spiritual despair . He said , " I lost touch with Christ the Savior and Comforter , and made of him the jailer and hangman of my poor soul . " Johann von Staupitz , his superior , pointed Luther 's mind away from continual reflection upon his sins toward the merits of Christ . He taught that true repentance does not involve self-inflicted penances and punishments but rather a change of heart .
Bern is built on very uneven ground . There is an elevation difference of several metres between the inner city districts on the Aare ( Matte , Marzili ) and the higher ones ( Kirchenfeld , Länggasse ) .
Many adaptations of the instrument have been done to cater to the special needs of Indian Carnatic music . In Indian classical music and Indian light music , the mandolin , which bears little resemblance to the European mandolin , is usually tuned E-B-E-B . As there is no concept of absolute pitch in Indian classical music , any convenient tuning maintaining these relative pitch intervals between the strings can be used . Another prevalent tuning with these intervals is C-G-C-G , which corresponds to Sa-Pa-Sa-Pa in the Indian carnatic classical music style . This tuning corresponds to the way violins are tuned for carnatic classical music . This type of mandolin is also used in Bhangra , dance music popular in Punjabi culture .
The Panthers defense gave up just 308 points , ranking sixth in the league , while also leading the NFL in interceptions with 24 and boasting four Pro Bowl selections . Pro Bowl defensive tackle Kawann Short led the team in sacks with 11 , while also forcing three fumbles and recovering two . Fellow lineman Mario Addison added 6½ sacks . The Panthers line also featured veteran defensive end Jared Allen , a 5-time pro bowler who was the NFL 's active career sack leader with 136 , along with defensive end Kony Ealy , who had 5 sacks in just 9 starts . Behind them , two of the Panthers three starting linebackers were also selected to play in the Pro Bowl : Thomas Davis and Luke Kuechly . Davis compiled 5½ sacks , four forced fumbles , and four interceptions , while Kuechly led the team in tackles ( 118 ) forced two fumbles , and intercepted four passes of his own . Carolina 's secondary featured Pro Bowl safety Kurt Coleman , who led the team with a career high seven interceptions , while also racking up 88 tackles and Pro Bowl cornerback Josh Norman , who developed into a shutdown corner during the season and had four interceptions , two of which were returned for touchdowns .
The new government drafted and implemented a constitution in 1923 based on a parliamentary system . Saad Zaghlul was popularly elected as Prime Minister of Egypt in 1924 . In 1936 , the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty was concluded . Continued instability due to remaining British influence and increasing political involvement by the king led to the dissolution of the parliament in a military coup d'état known as the 1952 Revolution . The Free Officers Movement forced King Farouk to abdicate in support of his son Fuad . British military presence in Egypt lasted until 1954 .
As of 2005 , there were over 50 churches recognized as cardinalatial deaconries , though there were only 30 cardinals of the order of deacons . Cardinal deacons have long enjoyed the right to " opt for the order of cardinal priests " ( optazione ) after they have been cardinal deacons for 10 years . They may on such elevation take a vacant " title " ( a church allotted to a cardinal priest as the church in Rome with which he is associated ) or their diaconal church may be temporarily elevated to a cardinal priest 's " title " for that occasion . When elevated to cardinal priests , they take their precedence according to the day they were first made cardinal deacons ( thus ranking above cardinal priests who were elevated to the college after them , regardless of order ) .
The US racial or ethnic classification " black " refers to people with all possible kinds of skin pigmentation , from the darkest through to the very lightest skin colors , including albinos , if they are believed by others to have West African ancestry ( in any discernible percentage ) , or to exhibit cultural traits associated with being " African American " . As a result , in the United States the term " black people " is not an indicator of skin color or ethnic origin but is instead a socially based racial classification related to being African American , with a family history associated with institutionalized slavery . Relatively dark-skinned people can be classified as white if they fulfill other social criteria of " whiteness " , and relatively light-skinned people can be classified as black if they fulfill the social criteria for " blackness " in a particular setting .
The second half of the 20th century to the present has seen a gradual shift towards improved human rights for Aboriginal people . In a 1967 referendum over 90 % of the Australian population voted to end constitutional discrimination and to include Aborigines in the national census . During this period many Aboriginal activists began to embrace the term " black " and use their ancestry as a source of pride . Activist Bob Maza said :
Distinctive and self-identified black communities have been reported in countries such as Iraq , with a reported 1.2 million black people , and they attest to a history of discrimination . African-Iraquis have sought minority status from the government , which would reserve some seats in Parliament for representatives of their population . According to Alamin M. Mazrui et al. , generally in the Arabian Peninsula and neighboring countries , most of those of visible African descent are still classified and identify as Arab , not black .
As in Brazil , the mandolin has played an important role in the Music of Venezuela . It has enjoyed a privileged position as the main melodic instrument in several different regions of the country . Specifically , the eastern states of Sucre , Nueva Esparta , Anzoategui and Monagas have made the mandolin the main instrument in their versions of Joropo as well as Puntos , Jotas , Polos , Fulias , Merengues and Malagueñas . Also , in the west of the country the sound of the mandolin is intrinsically associated with the regional genres of the Venezuelan Andes : Bambucos , Pasillos , Pasodobles , and Waltzes . In the western city of Maracaibo the Mandolin has been played in Decimas , Danzas and Contradanzas Zulianas ; in the capital , Caracas , the Merengue Rucaneao , Pasodobles and Waltzes have also been played with mandolin for almost a century . Today , Venezuelan mandolists include an important group of virtuoso players and ensembles such as Alberto Valderrama , Jesus Rengel , Ricardo Sandoval , Saul Vera , and Cristobal Soto .
This nationwide acceptance and recognition of Aboriginal people led to a significant increase in the number of people self-identifying as Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander . The reappropriation of the term " black " with a positive and more inclusive meaning has resulted in its widespread use in mainstream Australian culture , including public media outlets , government agencies , and private companies . In 2012 , a number of high-profile cases highlighted the legal and community attitude that identifying as Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander is not dependent on skin colour , with a well-known boxer Anthony Mundine being widely criticised for questioning the " blackness " of another boxer and journalist Andrew Bolt being successfully sued for publishing discriminatory comments about Aboriginals with light skin .
ARC was acquired in 1938 by the Columbia Broadcasting System ( CBS , which , in turn , had been formed by the Columbia Phonograph Company , but then sold off ) . ARC was renamed Columbia Recording Corporation . The Columbia Phonograph Company had international subsidiaries and affiliates such as the Columbia Graphophone Company in the United Kingdom , but they were sold off prior to CBS acquiring American Columbia . RCA Victor Records executive Ted Wallerstein convinced CBS head William S. Paley to buy ARC and Paley made Wallerstein head of the newly acquired record company . The renamed company made Columbia its flagship label with Okeh its subsidiary label while deemphasizing ARC 's other labels . This allowed ARC 's leased labels Brunswick Records and Vocalion Records to revert to former owner Warner Bros. which sold the labels to Decca Records . Columbia kept the Brunswick catalogue recorded from December 1931 onward which was reissued on the Columbia label as well as the Vocalion label material from the same time period which was reissued on the Okeh label . Wallerstein , who was promoted at the end of 1947 from president to chairman of the record company , restored Columbia 's status as a leading record company and spearheaded the successful introduction of the long playing ( LP ) record before he retired as Columbia 's chairman in 1951 . James Conkling then became head of Columbia Records . Also in 1951 , Columbia severed its ties with the EMI-owned record label of the same name and began a UK distribution deal with Philips Records , whereas Okeh Records continued to be distributed by EMI on the Columbia label .
The expansion of mandolin use continued after World War II through the late 1960s , and Japan still maintains a strong classical music tradition using mandolins , with active orchestras and university music programs . New orchestras were founded and new orchestral compositions composed . Japanese mandolin orchestras today may consist of up to 40 or 50 members , and can include woodwind , percussion , and brass sections . Japan also maintains an extensive collection of 20th Century mandolin music from Europe and one of the most complete collections of mandolin magazines from mandolin 's golden age , purchased by Morishige Takei .
On 19 October 1512 , he was awarded his Doctor of Theology and , on 21 October 1512 , was received into the senate of the theological faculty of the University of Wittenberg , having been called to the position of Doctor in Bible . He spent the rest of his career in this position at the University of Wittenberg .
CBS set the base rate for a 30-second advertisement at $ 5,000,000 , a record high price for a Super Bowl ad . As of January 26 , the advertisements had not yet sold out . CBS mandated that all advertisers purchase a package covering time on both the television and digital broadcasts of the game , meaning that for the first time , digital streams of the game would carry all national advertising in pattern with the television broadcast . This would be the final year in a multi-year contract with Anheuser-Busch InBev that allowed the beer manufacturer to air multiple advertisements during the game at a steep discount . It was also the final year that Doritos , a longtime sponsor of the game , held its " Crash the Super Bowl " contest that allowed viewers to create their own Doritos ads for a chance to have it aired during the game . Nintendo and The Pokémon Company also made their Super Bowl debut , promoting the 20th anniversary of the Pokémon video game and media franchise .
As of 2000 [ update ] , there were 9,045 pupils in Bern who came from another municipality , while 1,185 residents attended schools outside the municipality .
Luther 's other major works on the Jews were his 60,000-word treatise Von den Juden und Ihren Lügen ( On the Jews and Their Lies ) , and Vom Schem Hamphoras und vom Geschlecht Christi ( On the Holy Name and the Lineage of Christ ) , both published in 1543 , three years before his death . Luther argued that the Jews were no longer the chosen people but " the devil 's people " , and referred to them with violent , vile language . Citing Deuteronomy 13 , wherein Moses commands the killing of idolaters and the burning of their cities and property as an offering to God , Luther called for a " scharfe Barmherzigkeit " ( " sharp mercy " ) against the Jews " to see whether we might save at least a few from the glowing flames . " Luther advocated setting synagogues on fire , destroying Jewish prayerbooks , forbidding rabbis from preaching , seizing Jews ' property and money , and smashing up their homes , so that these " envenomed worms " would be forced into labour or expelled " for all time " . In Robert Michael 's view , Luther 's words " We are at fault in not slaying them " amounted to a sanction for murder . " God 's anger with them is so intense , " Luther concluded , " that gentle mercy will only tend to make them worse , while sharp mercy will reform them but little . Therefore , in any case , away with them ! "
The term " Moors " has been used in Europe in a broader , somewhat derogatory sense to refer to Muslims , especially those of Arab or Berber descent , whether living in North Africa or Iberia . Moors were not a distinct or self-defined people . Medieval and early modern Europeans applied the name to Muslim Arabs , Berbers , Black Africans and Europeans alike .
As opposed to broadcasts of primetime series , CBS broadcast special episodes of its late night talk shows as its lead-out programs for Super Bowl 50 , beginning with a special episode of The Late Show with Stephen Colbert following the game . Following a break for late local programming , CBS also aired a special episode of The Late Late Show with James Corden .
Bern was occupied by French troops in 1798 during the French Revolutionary Wars , when it was stripped of parts of its territories . It regained control of the Bernese Oberland in 1802 , and following the Congress of Vienna of 1814 , it newly acquired the Bernese Jura . At this time , it once again became the largest canton of the confederacy as it stood during the Restoration and until the secession of the canton of Jura in 1979 . Bern was made the Federal City ( seat of the Federal Assembly ) within the new Swiss federal state in 1848 .
The Siddi are an ethnic group inhabiting India and Pakistan whose members are descended from Bantu peoples from Southeast Africa that were brought to the Indian subcontinent as slaves by Arab and Portuguese merchants . Although it is commonly believed locally that " Siddi " derives from a word meaning " black " , the term is actually derived from " Sayyid " , the title borne by the captains of the Arab vessels that first brought Siddi settlers to the area . In the Makran strip of the Sindh and Balochistan provinces in southwestern Pakistan , these Bantu descendants are known as the Makrani . There was a brief " Black Power " movement in Sindh in the 1960s and many Siddi are proud of and celebrate their African ancestry .
By the end of the decade a distinct genre of hard rock was emerging with bands like Led Zeppelin , who mixed the music of early rock bands with a more hard-edged form of blues rock and acid rock on their first two albums Led Zeppelin ( 1969 ) and Led Zeppelin II ( 1969 ) , and Deep Purple , who began as a progressive rock group but achieved their commercial breakthrough with their fourth and distinctively heavier album , In Rock ( 1970 ) . Also significant was Black Sabbath 's Paranoid ( 1970 ) , which combined guitar riffs with dissonance and more explicit references to the occult and elements of Gothic horror . All three of these bands have been seen as pivotal in the development of heavy metal , but where metal further accentuated the intensity of the music , with bands like Judas Priest following Sabbath 's lead into territory that was often " darker and more menacing " , hard rock tended to continue to remain the more exuberant , good-time music .
In the early 20th century several mandolin orchestras ( Estudiantinas ) were active in Belgium . Today only a few groups remain : Royal Estudiantina la Napolitaine ( founded in 1904 ) in Antwerp , Brasschaats mandoline orkest in Brasschaat and an orchestra in Mons ( Bergen ) . Gerda Abts is a well known mandolin virtuoso in Belgium . She is also mandolin teacher and gives lessons in the music academies of Lier , Wijnegem and Brasschaat . She is now also professor mandolin at the music high school “ Koninklijk Conservatorium Artesis Hogeschool Antwerpen ” . She also gives various concerts each year in different ensembles . She is in close contact to the Brasschaat mandolin Orchestra . Her site is www.gevoeligesnaar.be
Egypt was producing 691,000 bbl/d of oil and 2,141.05 Tcf of natural gas ( in 2013 ) , which makes Egypt as the largest oil producer not member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries ( OPEC ) and the second-largest dry natural gas producer in Africa . In 2013 , Egypt was the largest consumer of oil and natural gas in Africa , as more than 20 % of total oil consumption and more than 40 % of total dry natural gas consumption in Africa . Also , Egypt possesses the largest oil refinery capacity in Africa 726,000 bbl/d ( in 2012 ) . Egypt is currently planning to build its first nuclear power plant in El Dabaa city , northern Egypt .
From the late 19th century , the South used a colloquial term , the one-drop rule , to classify as black a person of any known African ancestry . This practice of hypodescent was not put into law until the early 20th century . Legally the definition varied from state to state . Racial definition was more flexible in the 18th and 19th centuries before the American Civil War . For instance , President Thomas Jefferson held persons who were legally white ( less than 25 % black ) according to Virginia law at the time , but , because they were born to slave mothers , they were born into slavery , according to the principle of partus sequitur ventrem , which Virginia adopted into law in 1662 .
According to the Office for National Statistics , at the 2001 census there were over a million black people in the United Kingdom ; 1 % of the total population described themselves as " Black Caribbean " , 0.8 % as " Black African " , and 0.2 % as " Black other " . Britain encouraged the immigration of workers from the Caribbean after World War II ; the first symbolic movement was those who came on the ship the Empire Windrush . The preferred official umbrella term is " black and minority ethnic " ( BME ) , but sometimes the term " black " is used on its own , to express unified opposition to racism , as in the Southall Black Sisters , which started with a mainly British Asian constituency , and the National Black Police Association , which has a membership of " African , African-Caribbean and Asian origin " .
The Panthers beat the Seattle Seahawks in the divisional round , running up a 31–0 halftime lead and then holding off a furious second half comeback attempt to win 31–24 , avenging their elimination from a year earlier . The Panthers then blew out the Arizona Cardinals in the NFC Championship Game , 49–15 , racking up 487 yards and forcing seven turnovers .
Luther and his wife moved into a former monastery , " The Black Cloister , " a wedding present from the new elector John the Steadfast ( 1525–32 ) . They embarked on what appeared to have been a happy and successful marriage , though money was often short . Between bearing six children , Hans – June 1526 ; Elizabeth – 10 December 1527 , who died within a few months ; Magdalene – 1529 , who died in Luther 's arms in 1542 ; Martin – 1531 ; Paul – January 1533 ; and Margaret – 1534 ; Katharina helped the couple earn a living by farming the land and taking in boarders . Luther confided to Michael Stiefel on 11 August 1526 : " My Katie is in all things so obliging and pleasing to me that I would not exchange my poverty for the riches of Croesus . "
Other widely used alloys that contain zinc include nickel silver , typewriter metal , soft and aluminium solder , and commercial bronze . Zinc is also used in contemporary pipe organs as a substitute for the traditional lead/tin alloy in pipes . Alloys of 85–88 % zinc , 4–10 % copper , and 2–8 % aluminium find limited use in certain types of machine bearings . Zinc is the primary metal used in making American one cent coins since 1982 . The zinc core is coated with a thin layer of copper to give the impression of a copper coin . In 1994 , 33,200 tonnes ( 36,600 short tons ) of zinc were used to produce 13.6 billion pennies in the United States .
The last regular election of the City Parliament was held on 25 November 2012 for the mandate period ( German : Legislatur , French : la législature ) from 2013 to 2016 .

Peyton Manning became the first quarterback ever to lead two different teams to multiple Super Bowls . He is also the oldest quarterback ever to play in a Super Bowl at age 39 . The past record was held by John Elway , who led the Broncos to victory in Super Bowl XXXIII at age 38 and is currently Denver 's Executive Vice President of Football Operations and General Manager .
Egypt has a developed energy market based on coal , oil , natural gas , and hydro power . Substantial coal deposits in the northeast Sinai are mined at the rate of about 600,000 tonnes ( 590,000 long tons ; 660,000 short tons ) per year . Oil and gas are produced in the western desert regions , the Gulf of Suez , and the Nile Delta . Egypt has huge reserves of gas , estimated at 2,180 cubic kilometres ( 520 cu mi ) , and LNG up to 2012 exported to many countries . In 2013 , the Egyptian General Petroleum Co ( EGPC ) said the country will cut exports of natural gas and tell major industries to slow output this summer to avoid an energy crisis and stave off political unrest , Reuters has reported . Egypt is counting on top liquid natural gas ( LNG ) exporter Qatar to obtain additional gas volumes in summer , while encouraging factories to plan their annual maintenance for those months of peak demand , said EGPC chairman , Tarek El Barkatawy . Egypt produces its own energy , but has been a net oil importer since 2008 and is rapidly becoming a net importer of natural gas .
Luther next set about reversing or modifying the new church practices . By working alongside the authorities to restore public order , he signalled his reinvention as a conservative force within the Reformation . After banishing the Zwickau prophets , he now faced a battle against not only the established Church but also the radical reformers who threatened the new order by fomenting social unrest and violence .
BSkyB 's standard definition broadcasts are in DVB-compliant MPEG-2 , with the Sky Movies and Sky Box Office channels including optional Dolby Digital soundtracks for recent films , although these are only accessible with a Sky+ box . Sky+ HD material is broadcast using MPEG-4 and most of the HD material uses the DVB-S2 standard . Interactive services and 7-day EPG use the proprietary OpenTV system , with set-top boxes including modems for a return path . Sky News , amongst other channels , provides a pseudo-video on demand interactive service by broadcasting looping video streams .
By 1987 , CBS was the only " big three " American TV network to have a co-owned record company . ABC had sold its record division to MCA Records in 1979 , and in 1986 , NBC 's parent company RCA was sold to General Electric , who then sold off all other RCA units , including the record division ( which was bought by Ariola Records , later known as BMG ) .
In the United States , the game was televised by CBS , as part of a cycle between the three main broadcast television partners of the NFL . The network 's lead broadcast team of Jim Nantz and Phil Simms called the contest , with Tracy Wolfson and Evan Washburn on the sidelines . CBS introduced new features during the telecast , including pylon cameras and microphones along with EyeVision 360—an array of 36 cameras along the upper deck that can be used to provide a 360-degree view of plays and " bullet time " effects . ( An earlier version of EyeVision was last used in Super Bowl XXXV ; for Super Bowl 50 , the cameras were upgraded to 5K resolution . )

A few hard rock bands from the 1970s and 1980s managed to sustain highly successful recording careers . Bon Jovi were still able to achieve a commercial hit with " It 's My Life " from their double platinum-certified album Crush ( 2000 ) . and AC/DC released the platinum-certified Stiff Upper Lip ( 2000 ) Aerosmith released a number two platinum album , Just Push Play ( 2001 ) , which saw the band foray further into pop with the Top 10 hit " Jaded " , and a blues cover album , Honkin ' on Bobo , which reached number five in 2004 . Heart achieved their first Top 10 album since the early 90s with Red Velvet Car in 2010 , becoming the first female-led hard rock band to earn Top 10 albums spanning five decades . There were reunions and subsequent tours from Van Halen ( with Hagar in 2004 and then Roth in 2007 ) , The Who ( delayed in 2002 by the death of bassist John Entwistle until 2006 ) and Black Sabbath ( with Osbourne 1997–2006 and Dio 2006–2010 ) and even a one off performance by Led Zeppelin ( 2007 ) , renewing the interest in previous eras . Additionally , hard rock supergroups , such as Audioslave ( with former members of Rage Against the Machine and Soundgarden ) and Velvet Revolver ( with former members of Guns N ' Roses , punk band Wasted Youth and Stone Temple Pilots singer Scott Weiland ) , emerged and experienced some success . However , these bands were short-lived , ending in 2007 and 2008 , respectively . The long awaited Guns N ' Roses album Chinese Democracy was finally released in 2008 , but only went platinum and failed to come close to the success of the band 's late 1980s and early 1990s material . More successfully , AC/DC released the double platinum-certified Black Ice ( 2008 ) . Bon Jovi continued to enjoy success , branching into country music with " Who Says You Ca n't Go Home " , which reached number one on the Hot Country Singles chart in 2006 , and the rock/country album Lost Highway , which reached number one in 2007 . In 2009 , Bon Jovi released another number one album , The Circle , which marked a return to their hard rock sound .
On November 17 , 1987 , SCA acquired CBS Records , which hosted such acts as Michael Jackson , for US $ 2 billion . CBS Inc. , now CBS Corporation , retained the rights to the CBS name for music recordings but granted Sony a temporary license to use the CBS name . CBS Corporation founded a new CBS Records in 2006 , which is distributed by Sony through its RED subsidiary .
In honor of the 50th Super Bowl , the pregame ceremony featured the on-field introduction of 39 of the 43 previous Super Bowl Most Valuable Players . Bart Starr ( MVP of Super Bowls I and II ) and Chuck Howley ( MVP of Super Bowl V ) appeared via video , while Peyton Manning ( MVP of Super Bowl XLI and current Broncos quarterback ) was shown in the locker room preparing for the game . No plans were announced regarding the recognition of Harvey Martin , co-MVP of Super Bowl XII , who died in 2001 .
On Carolina 's next possession fullback Mike Tolbert lost a fumble while being tackled by safety Darian Stewart , which linebacker Danny Trevathan recovered on the Broncos 40-yard line . However , the Panthers soon took the ball back when defensive end Kony Ealy tipped a Manning pass to himself and then intercepted it , returning the ball 19 yards to the Panthers 39-yard line with 1:55 left on the clock . The Panthers could not gain any yards with their possession and had to punt . After a Denver punt , Carolina drove to the Broncos 45-yard line . But with 11 seconds left , Newton was sacked by DeMarcus Ware as time expired in the half .
The term " Moors " has been used in Europe in a broader , somewhat derogatory sense to refer to Muslims , especially those of Arab or Berber descent , whether living in North Africa or Iberia . Moors were not a distinct or self-defined people . Medieval and early modern Europeans applied the name to Muslim Arabs , Berbers , Black Africans and Europeans alike .
Martin Luther ( /ˈluːθər/ or /ˈluːðər/ ; German : [ ˈmaɐ̯tiːn ˈlʊtɐ ] ( listen ) ; 10 November 1483 – 18 February 1546 ) was a German professor of theology , composer , priest , former monk and a seminal figure in the Protestant Reformation . Luther came to reject several teachings and practices of the Late Medieval Catholic Church . He strongly disputed the claim that freedom from God 's punishment for sin could be purchased with money . He proposed an academic discussion of the power and usefulness of indulgences in his Ninety-Five Theses of 1517 . His refusal to retract all of his writings at the demand of Pope Leo X in 1520 and the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V at the Diet of Worms in 1521 resulted in his excommunication by the Pope and condemnation as an outlaw by the Emperor .
Luther wrote " Aus tiefer Not schrei ich zu dir " ( " From depths of woe I cry to you " ) in 1523 as a hymnic version of Psalm 130 and sent it as a sample to encourage evangelical colleagues to write psalm-hymns for use in German worship . In a collaboration with Paul Speratus , this and seven other hymns were published in the Achtliederbuch , the first Lutheran hymnal . In 1524 Luther developed his original four-stanza psalm paraphrase into a five-stanza Reformation hymn that developed the theme of " grace alone " more fully . Because it expressed essential Reformation doctrine , this expanded version of " Aus tiefer Not " was designated as a regular component of several regional Lutheran liturgies and was widely used at funerals , including Luther 's own . Along with Erhart Hegenwalt 's hymnic version of Psalm 51 , Luther 's expanded hymn was also adopted for use with the fifth part of Luther 's catechism , concerning confession .
The transition from the mandolino to the mandolin began around 1744 with the designing of the metal-string mandolin by the Vinaccia family , 3 brass strings and one of gut , using friction tuning pegs on a fingerboard that sat " flush " with the sound table . The mandolin grew in popularity over the next 60 years , in the streets where it was used by young men courting and by street musicians , and in the concert hall . After the Napoleonic Wars of 1815 , however , its popularity began to fall . The 19th century produced some prominent players , including Bartolomeo Bortolazzi of Venice and Pietro Vimercati . However , professional virtuosity was in decline , and the mandolin music changed as the mandolin became a folk instrument ; " the large repertoire of notated instrumental music for the mandolino and the mandoline was completely forgotten " . The export market for mandolins from Italy dried up around 1815 , and when Carmine de Laurentiis wrote a mandolin method in 1874 , the Music World magazine wrote that the mandolin was " out of date . " Salvador Léonardi mentioned this decline in his 1921 book , Méthode pour Banjoline ou Mandoline-Banjo , saying that the mandolin had been declining in popularity from previous times .
Isidore of Seville , writing in the 7th century , claimed that the Latin word Maurus was derived from the Greek mauron , μαύρον , which is the Greek word for black . Indeed , by the time Isidore of Seville came to write his Etymologies , the word Maurus or " Moor " had become an adjective in Latin , " for the Greeks call black , mauron " . " In Isidore ’ s day , Moors were black by definition… "
For the first time , the Super Bowl 50 Host Committee and the NFL have openly sought disabled veteran and lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender-owned businesses in Business Connect , the Super Bowl program that provides local companies with contracting opportunities in and around the Super Bowl . The host committee has already raised over $ 40 million through sponsors including Apple , Google , Yahoo ! , Intel , Gap , Chevron , and Dignity Health .
After a punt from both teams , Carolina got on track with a 9-play , 73-yard scoring drive . Newton completed 4 of 4 passes for 51 yards and rushed twice for 25 yards , while Jonathan Stewart finished the drive with a 1-yard touchdown run , cutting the score to 10–7 with 11:28 left in the second quarter . Later on , Broncos receiver Jordan Norwood received Brad Nortman 's short 28-yard punt surrounded by Panthers players , but none of them attempted to make a tackle , apparently thinking Norwood had called a fair catch . Norwood had not done so , and with no resistance around him , he took off for a Super Bowl record 61-yard return before Mario Addison dragged him down on the Panthers 14-yard line . Despite Denver 's excellent field position , they could not get the ball into the end zone , so McManus kicked a 33-yard field goal that increased their lead to 13–7 .
The cardinal protodeacon , the senior cardinal deacon in order of appointment to the College of Cardinals , has the privilege of announcing a new pope 's election and name ( once he has been ordained to the Episcopate ) from the central balcony at the Basilica of Saint Peter in Vatican City State . In the past , during papal coronations , the proto-deacon also had the honor of bestowing the pallium on the new pope and crowning him with the papal tiara . However , in 1978 Pope John Paul I chose not to be crowned and opted for a simpler papal inauguration ceremony , and his three successors followed that example . As a result , the Cardinal protodeacon 's privilege of crowning a new pope has effectively ceased although it could be revived if a future Pope were to restore a coronation ceremony . However , the proto-deacon still has the privilege of bestowing the pallium on a new pope at his papal inauguration . “ Acting in the place of the Roman Pontiff , he also confers the pallium upon metropolitan bishops or gives the pallium to their proxies. ” The current cardinal proto-deacon is Renato Raffaele Martino .
64Zn , the most abundant isotope of zinc , is very susceptible to neutron activation , being transmuted into the highly radioactive 65Zn , which has a half-life of 244 days and produces intense gamma radiation . Because of this , Zinc Oxide used in nuclear reactors as an anti-corrosion agent is depleted of 64Zn before use , this is called depleted zinc oxide . For the same reason , zinc has been proposed as a salting material for nuclear weapons ( cobalt is another , better-known salting material ) . A jacket of isotopically enriched 64Zn would be irradiated by the intense high-energy neutron flux from an exploding thermonuclear weapon , forming a large amount of 65Zn significantly increasing the radioactivity of the weapon 's fallout . Such a weapon is not known to have ever been built , tested , or used . 65Zn is also used as a tracer to study how alloys that contain zinc wear out , or the path and the role of zinc in organisms .
Phil Skinner played a key role in 20th century development of the mandolin movement in Australia , and was awarded an MBE in 1979 for services to music and the community . He was born Harry Skinner in Sydney in 1903 and started learning music at age 10 when his uncle tutored him on the banjo . Skinner began teaching part-time at age 18 , until the Great Depression forced him to begin teaching full-time and learn a broader range of instruments . Skinner founded the Sydney Mandolin Orchestra , the oldest surviving mandolin orchestra in Australia .
Pope Sixtus V limited the number of cardinals to 70 , comprising six cardinal bishops , 50 cardinal priests , and 14 cardinal deacons . Starting in the pontificate of Pope John XXIII , that limit has been exceeded . At the start of 1971 , Pope Paul VI set the number of cardinal electors at a maximum of 120 , but set no limit on the number of cardinals generally . He also established a maximum age of eighty years for electors . His action deprived twenty-five living cardinals , including the three living cardinals elevated by Pope Pius XI , of the right to participate in a conclave . [ citation needed ] Popes can dispense from church laws and have sometimes brought the number of cardinals under the age of 80 to more than 120 . Pope Paul VI also increased the number of cardinal bishops by giving that rank to patriarchs of the Eastern Catholic Churches .
The Ten Commandments , and the beginnings of the renewed life of Christians accorded to them by the sacrament of baptism , are a present foreshadowing of the believers ' future angel-like life in heaven in the midst of this life . Luther 's teaching of the Ten Commandments , therefore , has clear eschatological overtones , which , characteristically for Luther , do not encourage world-flight but direct the Christian to service to the neighbor in the common , daily vocations of this perishing world .
Luther came to understand justification as entirely the work of God . This teaching by Luther was clearly expressed in his 1525 publication On the Bondage of the Will , which was written in response to On Free Will by Desiderius Erasmus ( 1524 ) . Luther based his position on predestination on St. Paul 's epistle to the Ephesians 2:8–10 . Against the teaching of his day that the righteous acts of believers are performed in cooperation with God , Luther wrote that Christians receive such righteousness entirely from outside themselves ; that righteousness not only comes from Christ but actually is the righteousness of Christ , imputed to Christians ( rather than infused into them ) through faith . " That is why faith alone makes someone just and fulfills the law , " he wrote . " Faith is that which brings the Holy Spirit through the merits of Christ . " Faith , for Luther , was a gift from God ; the experience of being justified by faith was " as though I had been born again . " His entry into Paradise , no less , was a discovery about " the righteousness of God " – a discovery that " the just person " of whom the Bible speaks ( as in Romans 1:17 ) lives by faith . He explained his concept of " justification " in the Smalcald Articles :
While these few hard rock bands managed to maintain success and popularity in the early part of the decade , alternative forms of hard rock achieved mainstream success in the form of grunge in the US and Britpop in the UK . This was particularly evident after the success of Nirvana 's Nevermind ( 1991 ) , which combined elements of hardcore punk and heavy metal into a " dirty " sound that made use of heavy guitar distortion , fuzz and feedback , along with darker lyrical themes than their " hair band " predecessors . Although most grunge bands had a sound that sharply contrasted mainstream hard rock , several , including Pearl Jam , Alice in Chains , Mother Love Bone and Soundgarden , were more strongly influenced by 1970s and 1980s rock and metal , while Stone Temple Pilots managed to turn alternative rock into a form of stadium rock . However , all grunge bands shunned the macho , anthemic and fashion-focused aesthetics particularly associated with glam metal . In the UK , Oasis were unusual among the Britpop bands of the mid-1990s in incorporating a hard rock sound .
Albert Einstein lived in a flat at the Kramgasse 49 , the site of the Einsteinhaus , from 1903 to 1905 , the year in which the Annus Mirabilis Papers were published .
Peyton Manning became the first quarterback ever to lead two different teams to multiple Super Bowls . He is also the oldest quarterback ever to play in a Super Bowl at age 39 . The past record was held by John Elway , who led the Broncos to victory in Super Bowl XXXIII at age 38 and is currently Denver 's Executive Vice President of Football Operations and General Manager .
In his theses and disputations against the antinomians , Luther reviews and reaffirms , on the one hand , what has been called the " second use of the law , " that is , the law as the Holy Spirit 's tool to work sorrow over sin in man 's heart , thus preparing him for Christ 's fulfillment of the law offered in the gospel . Luther states that everything that is used to work sorrow over sin is called the law , even if it is Christ 's life , Christ 's death for sin , or God 's goodness experienced in creation . Simply refusing to preach the Ten Commandments among Christians – thereby , as it were , removing the three letters l-a-w from the church – does not eliminate the accusing law . Claiming that the law – in any form – should not be preached to Christians anymore would be tantamount to asserting that Christians are no longer sinners in themselves and that the church consists only of essentially holy people .
President Bush denied funding to the UNFPA . Over the course of the Bush Administration , a total of $ 244 million in Congressionally approved funding was blocked by the Executive Branch .
For the first time , the Super Bowl 50 Host Committee and the NFL have openly sought disabled veteran and lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender-owned businesses in Business Connect , the Super Bowl program that provides local companies with contracting opportunities in and around the Super Bowl . The host committee has already raised over $ 40 million through sponsors including Apple , Google , Yahoo ! , Intel , Gap , Chevron , and Dignity Health .
In South Africa , the period of colonization resulted in many unions and marriages between European men and African women from various tribes , resulting in mixed-race children . As the Europeans acquired territory and imposed rule over the Africans , they generally pushed mixed-race and Africans into second-class status . During the first half of the 20th century , the Afrikaaner-dominated government classified the population according to four main racial groups : Black , White , Asian ( mostly Indian ) , and Coloured . The Coloured group included people of mixed Bantu , Khoisan , and European descent ( with some Malay ancestry , especially in the Western Cape ) . The Coloured definition occupied an intermediary political position between the Black and White definitions in South Africa . It imposed a system of legal racial segregation , a complex of laws known as apartheid .
The definition makes no declaration about the Church 's belief that the Blessed Virgin was sinless in the sense of freedom from actual or personal sin . However , the Church holds that Mary was also sinless personally , " free from all sin , original or personal " . The Council of Trent decreed : " If anyone shall say that a man once justified can sin no more , nor lose grace , and that therefore he who falls and sins was never truly justified ; or , on the contrary , that throughout his whole life he can avoid all sins even venial sins , except by a special privilege of God , as the Church holds in regard to the Blessed Virgin : let him be anathema . "
Boundaries can be inclusive or exclusive depending on how they are perceived by other people . An exclusive boundary arises , for example , when a person adopts a marker that imposes restrictions on the behaviour of others . An inclusive boundary is created , by contrast , by the use of a marker with which other people are ready and able to associate . At the same time , however , an inclusive boundary will also impose restrictions on the people it has included by limiting their inclusion within other boundaries . An example of this is the use of a particular language by a newcomer in a room full of people speaking various languages . Some people may understand the language used by this person while others may not . Those who do not understand it might take the newcomer 's use of this particular language merely as a neutral sign of identity . But they might also perceive it as imposing an exclusive boundary that is meant to mark them off from her . On the other hand , those who do understand the newcomer 's language could take it as an inclusive boundary , through which the newcomer associates herself with them to the exclusion of the other people present . Equally , however , it is possible that people who do understand the newcomer but who also speak another language may not want to speak the newcomer 's language and so see her marker as an imposition and a negative boundary . It is possible that the newcomer is either aware or unaware of this , depending on whether she herself knows other languages or is conscious of the plurilingual quality of the people there and is respectful of it or not .
The report " Mary : Faith and Hope in Christ " , by the Anglican-Roman Catholic International Commission , concluded that the teaching about Mary in the two definitions of the Assumption and the Immaculate Conception can be said to be consonant with the teaching of the Scriptures and the ancient common traditions . But the report expressed concerns that the Roman Catholic dogmatic definitions of these concepts implies them to be " revealed by God " , stating : " The question arises for Anglicans , however , as to whether these doctrines concerning Mary are revealed by God in a way which must be held by believers as a matter of faith . "
In 1970 , President Nasser died and was succeeded by Anwar Sadat . Sadat switched Egypt 's Cold War allegiance from the Soviet Union to the United States , expelling Soviet advisors in 1972 . He launched the Infitah economic reform policy , while clamping down on religious and secular opposition . In 1973 , Egypt , along with Syria , launched the October War , a surprise attack to regain part of the Sinai territory Israel had captured 6 years earlier . it presented Sadat with a victory that allowed him to regain the Sinai later in return for peace with Israel .
Contemporaneously with the rise of analytic ethics in Anglo-American thought , in Europe several new lines of philosophy directed at critique of existing societies arose between the 1950s and 1980s . Most of these took elements of Marxist economic analysis , but combined them with a more cultural or ideological emphasis . Out of the Frankfurt School , thinkers like Herbert Marcuse , Theodor W. Adorno , Max Horkheimer , and Jürgen Habermas combined Marxian and Freudian perspectives . Along somewhat different lines , a number of other continental thinkers—still largely influenced by Marxism—put new emphases on structuralism and on a " return to Hegel " . Within the ( post- ) structuralist line ( though mostly not taking that label ) are thinkers such as Gilles Deleuze , Michel Foucault , Claude Lefort , and Jean Baudrillard . The Situationists were more influenced by Hegel ; Guy Debord , in particular , moved a Marxist analysis of commodity fetishism to the realm of consumption , and looked at the relation between consumerism and dominant ideology formation .
Luther justified his opposition to the rebels on three grounds . First , in choosing violence over lawful submission to the secular government , they were ignoring Christ 's counsel to " Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar 's " ; St. Paul had written in his epistle to the Romans 13:1–7 that all authorities are appointed by God and therefore should not be resisted . This reference from the Bible forms the foundation for the doctrine known as the Divine Right of Kings , or , in the German case , the divine right of the princes . Second , the violent actions of rebelling , robbing , and plundering placed the peasants " outside the law of God and Empire " , so they deserved " death in body and soul , if only as highwaymen and murderers . " Lastly , Luther charged the rebels with blasphemy for calling themselves " Christian brethren " and committing their sinful acts under the banner of the Gospel .
In the United States , the game was televised by CBS , as part of a cycle between the three main broadcast television partners of the NFL . The network 's lead broadcast team of Jim Nantz and Phil Simms called the contest , with Tracy Wolfson and Evan Washburn on the sidelines . CBS introduced new features during the telecast , including pylon cameras and microphones along with EyeVision 360—an array of 36 cameras along the upper deck that can be used to provide a 360-degree view of plays and " bullet time " effects . ( An earlier version of EyeVision was last used in Super Bowl XXXV ; for Super Bowl 50 , the cameras were upgraded to 5K resolution . )
Coptic Christians face discrimination at multiple levels of the government , ranging from disproportionate representation in government ministries to laws that limit their ability to build or repair churches . Intolerance of Bahá'ís and non-orthodox Muslim sects , such as Sufis , Shi'a and Ahmadis , also remains a problem . When the government moved to computerise identification cards , members of religious minorities , such as Bahá'ís , could not obtain identification documents . An Egyptian court ruled in early 2008 that members of other faiths may obtain identity cards without listing their faiths , and without becoming officially recognised .
Many people gain a sense of positive self-esteem from their identity groups , which furthers a sense of community and belonging . Another issue that researchers have attempted to address is the question of why people engage in discrimination , i.e. , why they tend to favor those they consider a part of their " in-group " over those considered to be outsiders . Both questions have been given extensive attention by researchers working in the social identity tradition . For example , in work relating to social identity theory it has been shown that merely crafting cognitive distinction between in- and out-groups can lead to subtle effects on people 's evaluations of others ( Cote & Levine 2002 ) .
A piece of paper was later found on which Luther had written his last statement . The statement was in Latin , apart from " We are beggars , " which was in German .
Zinc is a chemical element with symbol Zn and atomic number 30 . It is the first element of group 12 of the periodic table . In some respects zinc is chemically similar to magnesium : its ion is of similar size and its only common oxidation state is +2 . Zinc is the 24th most abundant element in Earth 's crust and has five stable isotopes . The most common zinc ore is sphalerite ( zinc blende ) , a zinc sulfide mineral . The largest mineable amounts are found in Australia , Asia , and the United States . Zinc production includes froth flotation of the ore , roasting , and final extraction using electricity ( electrowinning ) .
Egypt has a developed energy market based on coal , oil , natural gas , and hydro power . Substantial coal deposits in the northeast Sinai are mined at the rate of about 600,000 tonnes ( 590,000 long tons ; 660,000 short tons ) per year . Oil and gas are produced in the western desert regions , the Gulf of Suez , and the Nile Delta . Egypt has huge reserves of gas , estimated at 2,180 cubic kilometres ( 520 cu mi ) , and LNG up to 2012 exported to many countries . In 2013 , the Egyptian General Petroleum Co ( EGPC ) said the country will cut exports of natural gas and tell major industries to slow output this summer to avoid an energy crisis and stave off political unrest , Reuters has reported . Egypt is counting on top liquid natural gas ( LNG ) exporter Qatar to obtain additional gas volumes in summer , while encouraging factories to plan their annual maintenance for those months of peak demand , said EGPC chairman , Tarek El Barkatawy . Egypt produces its own energy , but has been a net oil importer since 2008 and is rapidly becoming a net importer of natural gas .
Over the next five days , private conferences were held to determine Luther 's fate . The Emperor presented the final draft of the Edict of Worms on 25 May 1521 , declaring Luther an outlaw , banning his literature , and requiring his arrest : " We want him to be apprehended and punished as a notorious heretic . " It also made it a crime for anyone in Germany to give Luther food or shelter . It permitted anyone to kill Luther without legal consequence .
Luther was the most widely read author of his generation , and within Germany he acquired the status of a prophet . According to the prevailing view among historians , his anti-Jewish rhetoric contributed significantly to the development of antisemitism in Germany , and in the 1930s and 1940s provided an " ideal underpinning " for the Nazis ' attacks on Jews . Reinhold Lewin writes that anybody who " wrote against the Jews for whatever reason believed he had the right to justify himself by triumphantly referring to Luther . " According to Michael , just about every anti-Jewish book printed in the Third Reich contained references to and quotations from Luther . Heinrich Himmler wrote admiringly of his writings and sermons on the Jews in 1940 . The city of Nuremberg presented a first edition of On the Jews and their Lies to Julius Streicher , editor of the Nazi newspaper Der Stürmer , on his birthday in 1937 ; the newspaper described it as the most radically anti-Semitic tract ever published . It was publicly exhibited in a glass case at the Nuremberg rallies and quoted in a 54-page explanation of the Aryan Law by Dr. E.H. Schulz and Dr. R. Frercks .
The mandolin has been used occasionally in rock music , first appearing in the psychedelic era of the late 1960s . Levon Helm of The Band occasionally moved from his drum kit to play mandolin , most notably on Rag Mama Rag , Rockin ' Chair , and Evangeline . Ian Anderson of Jethro Tull played mandolin on Fat Man , from their second album , Stand Up , and also occasionally on later releases . Rod Stewart 's 1971 No . 1 hit Maggie May features a significant mandolin riff . David Grisman played mandolin on two Grateful Dead songs on the American Beauty album , Friend of the Devil and Ripple , which became instant favorites among amateur pickers at jam sessions and campground gatherings . John Paul Jones and Jimmy Page both played mandolin on Led Zeppelin songs . The popular alt rock group Imagine Dragons feature the mandolin on a few of their songs , most prominently being It 's Time . Dash Crofts of the soft rock duo Seals and Crofts extensively used mandolin in their repertoire during the 1970s . Styx released the song Boat on the River in 1980 , which featured Tommy Shaw on vocals and mandolin . The song did n't chart in the United States but was popular in much of Europe and the Philippines .
Luther wrote " Ach Gott , vom Himmel sieh darein " ( " Oh God , look down from heaven " ) . " Nun komm , der Heiden Heiland " ( Now come , Savior of the gentiles ) , based on Veni redemptor gentium , became the main hymn ( Hauptlied ) for Advent . He transformed A solus ortus cardine to " Christum wir sollen loben schon " ( " We should now praise Christ " ) and Veni Creator Spiritus to " Komm , Gott Schöpfer , Heiliger Geist " ( " Come , Holy Spirit , Lord God " ) . He wrote two hymns on the Ten Commandments , " Dies sind die heilgen Zehn Gebot " and " Mensch , willst du leben seliglich " . His " Gelobet seist du , Jesu Christ " ( " Praise be to You , Jesus Christ " ) became the main hymn for Christmas . He wrote for Pentecost " Nun bitten wir den Heiligen Geist " , and adopted for Easter " Christ ist erstanden " ( Christ is risen ) , based on Victimae paschali laudes . " Mit Fried und Freud ich fahr dahin " , a paraphrase of Nunc dimittis , was intended for Purification , but became also a funeral hymn . He paraphrased the Te Deum as " Herr Gott , dich loben wir " with a simplified form of the melody . It became known as the German Te Deum .
Formed in November 1990 by the equal merger of Sky Television and British Satellite Broadcasting , BSkyB became the UK 's largest digital subscription television company . Following BSkyB 's 2014 acquisition of Sky Italia and a majority 90.04 % interest in Sky Deutschland in November 2014 , its holding company British Sky Broadcasting Group plc changed its name to Sky plc . The United Kingdom operations also changed the company name from British Sky Broadcasting Limited to Sky UK Limited , still trading as Sky .
In his 1805 mandolin method , Anweisung die Mandoline von selbst zu erlernen nebst einigen Uebungsstucken von Bortolazzi , Bartolomeo Bortolazzi popularised the Cremonese mandolin , which had four single-strings and a fixed bridge , to which the strings were attached . Bortolazzi said in this book that the new wire strung mandolins were uncomfortable to play , when compared with the gut-string instruments . Also , he felt they had a " less pleasing ... hard , zither-like tone " as compared to the gut string 's " softer , full-singing tone . " He favored the four single strings of the Cremonese instrument , which were tuned the same as the Neapolitan .
The game 's media day , which was typically held on the Tuesday afternoon prior to the game , was moved to the Monday evening and re-branded as Super Bowl Opening Night . The event was held on February 1 , 2016 at SAP Center in San Jose . Alongside the traditional media availabilities , the event featured an opening ceremony with player introductions on a replica of the Golden Gate Bridge .
Zinc chemistry is similar to the chemistry of the late first-row transition metals nickel and copper , though it has a filled d-shell , so its compounds are diamagnetic and mostly colorless . The ionic radii of zinc and magnesium happen to be nearly identical . Because of this some of their salts have the same crystal structure and in circumstances where ionic radius is a determining factor zinc and magnesium chemistries have much in common . Otherwise there is little similarity . Zinc tends to form bonds with a greater degree of covalency and it forms much more stable complexes with N- and S- donors . Complexes of zinc are mostly 4- or 6- coordinate although 5-coordinate complexes are known .
As of 2000 [ update ] , children and teenagers ( 0–19 years old ) make up 15.1 % of the population , while adults ( 20–64 years old ) make up 65 % and seniors ( over 64 years old ) make up 19.9 % .
The Super Bowl 50 Host Committee has vowed to be " the most giving Super Bowl ever " , and will dedicate 25 percent of all money it raises for philanthropic causes in the Bay Area . The committee created the 50 fund as its philanthropic initiative and focuses on providing grants to aid with youth development , community investment and sustainable environments .
Established bands made something of a comeback in the mid-1980s . After an 8-year separation , Deep Purple returned with the classic Machine Head line-up to produce Perfect Strangers ( 1984 ) , which reached number five in the UK , hit the top five in five other countries , and was a platinum-seller in the US . After somewhat slower sales of its fourth album , Fair Warning , Van Halen rebounded with the Top 3 album Diver Down in 1982 , then reached their commercial pinnacle with 1984 . It reached number two on the Billboard album chart and provided the track " Jump " , which reached number one on the singles chart and remained there for several weeks . Heart , after floundering during the first half of the decade , made a comeback with their eponymous ninth studio album which hit number one and contained four Top 10 singles including their first number one hit . The new medium of video channels was used with considerable success by bands formed in previous decades . Among the first were ZZ Top , who mixed hard blues rock with new wave music to produce a series of highly successful singles , beginning with " Gim me All Your Lovin ' " ( 1983 ) , which helped their albums Eliminator ( 1983 ) and Afterburner ( 1985 ) achieve diamond and multi-platinum status respectively . Others found renewed success in the singles charts with power ballads , including REO Speedwagon with " Keep on Loving You " ( 1980 ) and " Ca n't Fight This Feeling " ( 1984 ) , Journey with " Do n't Stop Believin ' " ( 1981 ) and " Open Arms " ( 1982 ) , Foreigner 's " I Want to Know What Love Is " , Scorpions ' " Still Loving You " ( both from 1984 ) , Heart ’ s " What About Love " ( 1985 ) and " These Dreams " ( 1986 ) , and Boston 's " Amanda " ( 1986 ) .
In addition to the Vince Lombardi Trophy that all Super Bowl champions receive , the winner of Super Bowl 50 will also receive a large , 18-karat gold-plated " 50 " . Each digit will weigh 33 lb ( 15 kg ) for a total of 66 lb ( 30 kg ) . Like the Lombardi Trophy , the " 50 " will be designed by Tiffany & Co .
Antonio Vivaldi composed a mandolin concerto ( Concerto in C major Op.3 6 ) and two concertos for two mandolins and orchestra . Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart placed it in his 1787 work Don Giovanni and Beethoven created four variations of it . Antonio Maria Bononcini composed La conquista delle Spagne di Scipione Africano il giovane in 1707 and George Frideric Handel composed Alexander Balus in 1748 . Others include Giovani Battista Gervasio ( Sonata in D major for Mandolin and Basso Continuo ) , Giuseppe Giuliano ( Sonata in D major for Mandolin and Basso Continuo ) , Emanuele Barbella ( Sonata in D major for Mandolin and Basso Continuo ) , Domenico Scarlatti ( Sonata n.54 ( K.89 ) in D minor for Mandolin and Basso Continuo ) , and Addiego Guerra ( Sonata in G major for Mandolin and Basso Continuo ) .
On 18 January 2014 , the interim government instituted a new constitution following a referendum in which 98.1 % of voters were supportive . Participation was low with only 38.6 % of registered voters participating although this was higher than the 33 % who voted in a referendum during Morsi 's tenure . On 26 March 2014 Abdel Fattah el-Sisi the head of the Egyptian Armed Forces , who at this time was in control of the country , resigned from the military , announcing he would stand as a candidate in the 2014 presidential election . The poll , held between 26 and 28 May 2014 , resulted in a landslide victory for el-Sisi . Sisi was sworn into office as President of Egypt on 8 June 2014 . The Muslim Brotherhood and some liberal and secular activist groups boycotted the vote . Even though the military-backed authorities extended voting to a third day , the 46 % turnout was lower than the 52 % turnout in the 2012 election .

Cornerbacks Aqib Talib ( three interceptions ) and Chris Harris , Jr. ( two interceptions ) were the other two Pro Bowl selections from the defense .
In the late 1960s , the term heavy metal was used interchangeably with hard rock , but gradually began to be used to describe music played with even more volume and intensity . While hard rock maintained a bluesy rock and roll identity , including some swing in the back beat and riffs that tended to outline chord progressions in their hooks , heavy metal 's riffs often functioned as stand-alone melodies and had no swing in them . Heavy metal took on " darker " characteristics after Black Sabbath 's breakthrough at the beginning of the 1970s . In the 1980s it developed a number of subgenres , often termed extreme metal , some of which were influenced by hardcore punk , and which further differentiated the two styles . Despite this differentiation , hard rock and heavy metal have existed side by side , with bands frequently standing on the boundary of , or crossing between , the genres .
BSkyB 's standard definition broadcasts are in DVB-compliant MPEG-2 , with the Sky Movies and Sky Box Office channels including optional Dolby Digital soundtracks for recent films , although these are only accessible with a Sky+ box . Sky+ HD material is broadcast using MPEG-4 and most of the HD material uses the DVB-S2 standard . Interactive services and 7-day EPG use the proprietary OpenTV system , with set-top boxes including modems for a return path . Sky News , amongst other channels , provides a pseudo-video on demand interactive service by broadcasting looping video streams .
Muhammad Ali Pasha evolved the military from one that convened under the tradition of the corvée to a great modernised army . He introduced conscription of the male peasantry in 19th century Egypt , and took a novel approach to create his great army , strengthening it with numbers and in skill . Education and training of the new soldiers was not an option ; the new concepts were furthermore enforced by isolation . The men were held in barracks to avoid distraction of their growth as a military unit to be reckoned with . The resentment for the military way of life eventually faded from the men and a new ideology took hold , one of nationalism and pride . It was with the help of this newly reborn martial unit that Muhammad Ali imposed his rule over Egypt .
Emerging British acts included Free , who released their signature song " All Right Now " ( 1970 ) , which has received extensive radio airplay in both the UK and US . After the breakup of the band in 1973 , vocalist Paul Rodgers joined supergroup Bad Company , whose eponymous first album ( 1974 ) was an international hit . The mixture of hard rock and progressive rock , evident in the works of Deep Purple , was pursued more directly by bands like Uriah Heep and Argent . Scottish band Nazareth released their self-titled début album in 1971 , producing a blend of hard rock and pop that would culminate in their best selling , Hair of the Dog ( 1975 ) , which contained the proto-power ballad " Love Hurts " . Having enjoyed some national success in the early 1970s , Queen , after the release of Sheer Heart Attack ( 1974 ) and A Night at the Opera ( 1975 ) , gained international recognition with a sound that used layered vocals and guitars and mixed hard rock with heavy metal , progressive rock , and even opera . The latter featured the single " Bohemian Rhapsody " , which stayed at number one in the UK charts for nine weeks .
Cardinal priests are the most numerous of the three orders of cardinals in the Catholic Church , ranking above the cardinal deacons and below the cardinal bishops . Those who are named cardinal priests today are generally bishops of important dioceses throughout the world , though some hold Curial positions .
The annual NFL Experience was held at the Moscone Center in San Francisco . In addition , " Super Bowl City " opened on January 30 at Justin Herman Plaza on The Embarcadero , featuring games and activities that will highlight the Bay Area 's technology , culinary creations , and cultural diversity . More than 1 million people are expected to attend the festivities in San Francisco during Super Bowl Week . San Francisco mayor Ed Lee said of the highly visible homeless presence in this area " they are going to have to leave " . San Francisco city supervisor Jane Kim unsuccessfully lobbied for the NFL to reimburse San Francisco for city services in the amount of $ 5 million .
On Carolina 's next possession fullback Mike Tolbert lost a fumble while being tackled by safety Darian Stewart , which linebacker Danny Trevathan recovered on the Broncos 40-yard line . However , the Panthers soon took the ball back when defensive end Kony Ealy tipped a Manning pass to himself and then intercepted it , returning the ball 19 yards to the Panthers 39-yard line with 1:55 left on the clock . The Panthers could not gain any yards with their possession and had to punt . After a Denver punt , Carolina drove to the Broncos 45-yard line . But with 11 seconds left , Newton was sacked by DeMarcus Ware as time expired in the half .
As of 2005 , there were over 50 churches recognized as cardinalatial deaconries , though there were only 30 cardinals of the order of deacons . Cardinal deacons have long enjoyed the right to " opt for the order of cardinal priests " ( optazione ) after they have been cardinal deacons for 10 years . They may on such elevation take a vacant " title " ( a church allotted to a cardinal priest as the church in Rome with which he is associated ) or their diaconal church may be temporarily elevated to a cardinal priest 's " title " for that occasion . When elevated to cardinal priests , they take their precedence according to the day they were first made cardinal deacons ( thus ranking above cardinal priests who were elevated to the college after them , regardless of order ) .

Different societies apply differing criteria regarding who is classified as " black " , and these social constructs have also changed over time . In a number of countries , societal variables affect classification as much as skin color , and the social criteria for " blackness " vary . For example , in North America the term black people is not necessarily an indicator of skin color or majority ethnic ancestry , but it is instead a socially based racial classification related to being African American , with a family history associated with institutionalized slavery . In South Africa and Latin America , for instance , mixed-race people are generally not classified as " black . " In South Pacific regions such as Australia and Melanesia , European colonists applied the term " black " or it was used by populations with different histories and ethnic origin .
A mandolin ( Italian : mandolino pronounced [ mandoˈliːno ] ; literally " small mandola " ) is a musical instrument in the lute family and is usually plucked with a plectrum or " pick " . It commonly has four courses of doubled metal strings tuned in unison ( 8 strings ) , although five ( 10 strings ) and six ( 12 strings ) course versions also exist . The courses are normally tuned in a succession of perfect fifths . It is the soprano member of a family that includes the mandola , octave mandolin , mandocello and mandobass .
The City Council ( Gemeinderat ) constitutes the executive government of the City of Bern and operates as a collegiate authority . It is composed of five councilors ( German : Gemeinderat/-rätin ) , each presiding over a directorate ( Direktion ) comprising several departments and bureaus . The president of the executive department acts as mayor ( Stadtpräsident ) . In the mandate period 2013–2016 ( Legislatur ) the City Council is presided by Stadtpräsident Alexander Tschäppät . Departmental tasks , coordination measures and implementation of laws decreed by the City Parliament are carried by the City Council . The regular election of the City Council by any inhabitant valid to vote is held every four years . Any resident of Bern allowed to vote can be elected as a member of the City Council . The delegates are selected by means of a system of Majorz . The mayor is elected as such as well by public election while the heads of the other directorates are assigned by the collegiate . The executive body holds its meetings in the Erlacherhof , built by architect Albrecht Stürler after 1747 .
The structure known as " Virgil 's tomb " is found at the entrance of an ancient Roman tunnel ( also known as " grotta vecchia " ) in Piedigrotta , a district two miles from the centre of Naples , near the Mergellina harbor , on the road heading north along the coast to Pozzuoli . While Virgil was already the object of literary admiration and veneration before his death , in the Middle Ages his name became associated with miraculous powers , and for a couple of centuries his tomb was the destination of pilgrimages and veneration .
Often categorised with the New Wave of British Heavy Metal , in 1981 Def Leppard released their second album High 'n ' Dry , mixing glam-rock with heavy metal , and helping to define the sound of hard rock for the decade . The follow-up Pyromania ( 1983 ) , reached number two on the American charts and the singles " Photograph " , " Rock of Ages " and " Foolin ' " , helped by the emergence of MTV , all reached the Top 40 . It was widely emulated , particularly by the emerging Californian glam metal scene . This was followed by US acts like Mötley Crüe , with their albums Too Fast for Love ( 1981 ) and Shout at the Devil ( 1983 ) and , as the style grew , the arrival of bands such as Ratt , White Lion , Twisted Sister and Quiet Riot . Quiet Riot 's album Metal Health ( 1983 ) was the first glam metal album , and arguably the first heavy metal album of any kind , to reach number one in the Billboard music charts and helped open the doors for mainstream success by subsequent bands .
QuickBooks sponsored a " Small Business Big Game " contest , in which Death Wish Coffee had a 30-second commercial aired free of charge courtesy of QuickBooks . Death Wish Coffee beat out nine other contenders from across the United States for the free advertisement .
In July 2012 , Ancestry.com reported on historic and DNA research by its staff that discovered that Obama is likely a descendant through his mother of John Punch , considered by some historians to be the first African slave in the Virginia colony . An indentured servant , he was " bound for life " in 1640 after trying to escape . The story of him and his descendants is that of multi-racial America since it appeared he and his sons married or had unions with white women , likely indentured servants and working-class like them . Their multi-racial children were free because they were born to free English women . Over time , Obama 's line of the Bunch family ( as they became known ) were property owners and continued to " marry white " ; they became part of white society , likely by the early to mid-18th century .
In Anglo-American academic political philosophy , the publication of John Rawls 's A Theory of Justice in 1971 is considered a milestone . Rawls used a thought experiment , the original position , in which representative parties choose principles of justice for the basic structure of society from behind a veil of ignorance . Rawls also offered a criticism of utilitarian approaches to questions of political justice . Robert Nozick 's 1974 book Anarchy , State , and Utopia , which won a National Book Award , responded to Rawls from a libertarian perspective and gained academic respectability for libertarian viewpoints .
In mid May 1967 , the Soviet Union issued warnings to Nasser of an impending Israeli attack on Syria . Although the chief of staff Mohamed Fawzi verified them as " baseless " , Nasser took three successive steps that made the war virtually inevitable : On 14 May he deployed his troops in Sinai near the border with Israel , on 19 May he expelled the UN peacekeepers stationed in the Sinai Peninsula border with Israel , and on 23 May he closed the Straits of Tiran to Israeli shipping . On 26 May Nasser declared , " The battle will be a general one and our basic objective will be to destroy Israel " .
UNFPA 's connection to China 's administration of forced abortions was refuted by investigations carried out by various US , UK , and UN teams sent to examine UNFPA activities in China . Specifically , a three-person U.S State Department fact-finding team was sent on a two-week tour throughout China . It wrote in a report to the State Department that it found " no evidence that UNFPA has supported or participated in the management of a program of coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization in China , " as has been charged by critics .
Islamic political philosophy , was , indeed , rooted in the very sources of Islam—i.e. , the Qur'an and the Sunnah , the words and practices of Muhammad—thus making it essentially theocratic . However , in the Western thought , it is generally supposed that it was a specific area peculiar merely to the great philosophers of Islam : al-Kindi ( Alkindus ) , al-Farabi ( Abunaser ) , İbn Sina ( Avicenna ) , Ibn Bajjah ( Avempace ) , Ibn Rushd ( Averroes ) , and Ibn Khaldun . The political conceptions of Islam such as kudrah ( power ) , sultan , ummah , cemaa ( obligation ) -and even the " core " terms of the Qur'an—i.e. , ibadah ( worship ) , din ( religion ) , rab ( master ) and ilah ( deity ) —is taken as the basis of an analysis . Hence , not only the ideas of the Muslim political philosophers but also many other jurists and ulama posed political ideas and theories . For example , the ideas of the Khawarij in the very early years of Islamic history on Khilafa and Ummah , or that of Shia Islam on the concept of Imamah are considered proofs of political thought . The clashes between the Ehl-i Sunna and Shia in the 7th and 8th centuries had a genuine political character .
Virgil is traditionally ranked as one of Rome 's greatest poets . His Aeneid has been considered the national epic of ancient Rome from the time of its composition to the present day . Modeled after Homer 's Iliad and Odyssey , the Aeneid follows the Trojan refugee Aeneas as he struggles to fulfill his destiny and arrive on the shores of Italy—in Roman mythology the founding act of Rome . Virgil 's work has had wide and deep influence on Western literature , most notably Dante 's Divine Comedy , in which Virgil appears as Dante 's guide through hell and purgatory .
The Broncos defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers in the divisional round , 23–16 , by scoring 11 points in the final three minutes of the game . They then beat the defending Super Bowl XLIX champion New England Patriots in the AFC Championship Game , 20–18 , by intercepting a pass on New England 's 2-point conversion attempt with 17 seconds left on the clock . Despite Manning 's problems with interceptions during the season , he did n't throw any in their two playoff games .
Egypt ( i/ˈiːdʒɪpt/ ; Arabic : مِصر‎ Miṣr , Egyptian Arabic : مَصر Maṣr , Coptic : Ⲭⲏⲙⲓ Khemi ) , officially the Arab Republic of Egypt , is a transcontinental country spanning the northeast corner of Africa and southwest corner of Asia , via a land bridge formed by the Sinai Peninsula . It is the world 's only contiguous Eurafrasian nation . Most of Egypt 's territory of 1,010,408 square kilometres ( 390,000 sq mi ) lies within the Nile Valley . Egypt is a Mediterranean country . It is bordered by the Gaza Strip and Israel to the northeast , the Gulf of Aqaba to the east , the Red Sea to the east and south , Sudan to the south and Libya to the west .
In 2007 , BSkyB and Virgin Media became involved in a dispute over the carriage of Sky channels on cable TV . The failure to renew the existing carriage agreements negotiated with NTL and Telewest resulted in Virgin Media removing the basic channels from the network on 1 March 2007 . Virgin Media claimed that BSkyB had substantially increased the asking price for the channels , a claim which BSkyB denied , on the basis that their new deal offered " substantially more value " by including HD channels and Video On Demand content which was not previously carried by cable .
Provided is a universal Ku band LNB ( 9.75/10.600 GHz ) which is fitted at the end of the dish and pointed at the correct satellite constellation ; most digital receivers will receive the free to air channels . Some broadcasts are free-to-air and unencrypted , some are encrypted but do not require a monthly subscription ( known as free-to-view ) , some are encrypted and require a monthly subscription , and some are pay-per-view services . To view the encrypted content a VideoGuard UK equipped receiver ( all of which are dedicated to the Sky service , and can not be used to decrypt other services ) needs to be used . Unofficial CAMs are now available to view the service , although use of them breaks the user 's contract with Sky and invalidates the user 's rights to use the card .
In the early 20th century several mandolin orchestras ( Estudiantinas ) were active in Belgium . Today only a few groups remain : Royal Estudiantina la Napolitaine ( founded in 1904 ) in Antwerp , Brasschaats mandoline orkest in Brasschaat and an orchestra in Mons ( Bergen ) . Gerda Abts is a well known mandolin virtuoso in Belgium . She is also mandolin teacher and gives lessons in the music academies of Lier , Wijnegem and Brasschaat . She is now also professor mandolin at the music high school “ Koninklijk Conservatorium Artesis Hogeschool Antwerpen ” . She also gives various concerts each year in different ensembles . She is in close contact to the Brasschaat mandolin Orchestra . Her site is www.gevoeligesnaar.be
There would be no more scoring in the third quarter , but early in the fourth , the Broncos drove to the Panthers 41-yard line . On the next play , Ealy knocked the ball out of Manning 's hand as he was winding up for a pass , and then recovered it for Carolina on the 50-yard line . A 16-yard reception by Devin Funchess and a 12-yard run by Stewart then set up Gano 's 39-yard field goal , cutting the Panthers deficit to one score at 16–10 . The next three drives of the game would end in punts .
Zinc ( I ) compounds are rare , and require bulky ligands to stabilize the low oxidation state . Most zinc ( I ) compounds contain formally the [ Zn2 ] 2+ core , which is analogous to the [ Hg2 ] 2+ dimeric cation present in mercury ( I ) compounds . The diamagnetic nature of the ion confirms its dimeric structure . The first zinc ( I ) compound containing the Zn—Zn bond , ( η5-C5Me5 ) 2Zn2 , is also the first dimetallocene . The [ Zn2 ] 2+ ion rapidly disproportionates into zinc metal and zinc ( II ) , and has only been obtained as a yellow glass formed by cooling a solution of metallic zinc in molten ZnCl2 .
As the designated home team in the annual rotation between AFC and NFC teams , the Broncos elected to wear their road white jerseys with matching white pants . Elway stated , " We 've had Super Bowl success in our white uniforms . " The Broncos last wore matching white jerseys and pants in the Super Bowl in Super Bowl XXXIII , Elway 's last game as Denver QB , when they defeated the Atlanta Falcons 34–19 . In their only other Super Bowl win in Super Bowl XXXII , Denver wore blue jerseys , which was their primary color at the time . They also lost Super Bowl XXI when they wore white jerseys , but they are 0-4 in Super Bowls when wearing orange jerseys , losing in Super Bowl XII , XXII , XXIV , and XLVIII . The only other AFC champion team to have worn white as the designated home team in the Super Bowl was the Pittsburgh Steelers ; they defeated the Seattle Seahawks 21–10 in Super Bowl XL 10 seasons prior . The Broncos ' decision to wear white meant the Panthers would wear their standard home uniform : black jerseys with silver pants .
Beside the introduction of the lute to Spain ( Andalusia ) by the Moors , another important point of transfer of the lute from Arabian to European culture was Sicily , where it was brought either by Byzantine or later by Muslim musicians . There were singer-lutenists at the court in Palermo following the Norman conquest of the island from the Muslims , and the lute is depicted extensively in the ceiling paintings in the Palermo ’ s royal Cappella Palatina , dedicated by the Norman King Roger II of Sicily in 1140 . His Hohenstaufen grandson Frederick II , Holy Roman Emperor ( 1194 - 1250 ) continued integrating Muslims into his court , including Moorish musicians . By the 14th century , lutes had disseminated throughout Italy and , probably because of the cultural influence of the Hohenstaufen kings and emperor , based in Palermo , the lute had also made significant inroads into the German-speaking lands .
Other major bluegrass mandolinists who emerged in the early 1950s and are still active include Jesse McReynolds ( of Jim and Jesse ) who invented a syncopated banjo-roll-like style called crosspicking—and Bobby Osborne of the Osborne Brothers , who is a master of clarity and sparkling single-note runs . Highly respected and influential modern bluegrass players include Herschel Sizemore , Doyle Lawson , and the multi-genre Sam Bush , who is equally at home with old-time fiddle tunes , rock , reggae , and jazz . Ronnie McCoury of the Del McCoury Band has won numerous awards for his Monroe-influenced playing . The late John Duffey of the original Country Gentlemen and later the Seldom Scene did much to popularize the bluegrass mandolin among folk and urban audiences , especially on the east coast and in the Washington , D.C. area .
BSkyB 's direct-to-home satellite service became available in 10 million homes in 2010 , Europe 's first pay-TV platform in to achieve that milestone . Confirming it had reached its target , the broadcaster said its reach into 36 % of households in the UK represented an audience of more than 25m people . The target was first announced in August 2004 , since then an additional 2.4m customers had subscribed to BSkyB 's direct-to-home service . Media commentators had debated whether the figure could be reached as the growth in subscriber numbers elsewhere in Europe flattened .
Luther came to understand justification as entirely the work of God . This teaching by Luther was clearly expressed in his 1525 publication On the Bondage of the Will , which was written in response to On Free Will by Desiderius Erasmus ( 1524 ) . Luther based his position on predestination on St. Paul 's epistle to the Ephesians 2:8–10 . Against the teaching of his day that the righteous acts of believers are performed in cooperation with God , Luther wrote that Christians receive such righteousness entirely from outside themselves ; that righteousness not only comes from Christ but actually is the righteousness of Christ , imputed to Christians ( rather than infused into them ) through faith . " That is why faith alone makes someone just and fulfills the law , " he wrote . " Faith is that which brings the Holy Spirit through the merits of Christ . " Faith , for Luther , was a gift from God ; the experience of being justified by faith was " as though I had been born again . " His entry into Paradise , no less , was a discovery about " the righteousness of God " – a discovery that " the just person " of whom the Bible speaks ( as in Romans 1:17 ) lives by faith . He explained his concept of " justification " in the Smalcald Articles :
However , the formation of one 's identity occurs through one 's identifications with significant others ( primarily with parents and other individuals during one 's biographical experiences , and also with " groups " as they are perceived ) . These others may be benign - such that one aspires to their characteristics , values and beliefs ( a process of idealistic-identification ) , or malign - when one wishes to dissociate from their characteristics ( a process of defensive contra-identification ) ( Weinreich & Saunderson 2003 , Chapter 1 , pp 54–61 ) .
When Cowan Powers and his family recorded their old-time music from 1924-1926 , his daughter Orpha Powers was one of the earliest known southern-music artists to record with the mandolin . By the 1930s , single mandolins were becoming more commonly used in southern string band music , most notably by brother duets such as the sedate Blue Sky Boys ( Bill Bolick and Earl Bolick ) and the more hard-driving Monroe Brothers ( Bill Monroe and Charlie Monroe ) . However , the mandolin 's modern popularity in country music can be directly traced to one man : Bill Monroe , the father of bluegrass music . After the Monroe Brothers broke up in 1939 , Bill Monroe formed his own group , after a brief time called the Blue Grass Boys , and completed the transition of mandolin styles from a " parlor " sound typical of brother duets to the modern " bluegrass " style . He joined the Grand Ole Opry in 1939 and its powerful clear-channel broadcast signal on WSM-AM spread his style throughout the South , directly inspiring many musicians to take up the mandolin . Monroe famously played Gibson F-5 mandolin , signed and dated July 9 , 1923 , by Lloyd Loar , chief acoustic engineer at Gibson . The F-5 has since become the most imitated tonally and aesthetically by modern builders .
Martin Luther , who initiated the Protestant Reformation , said : " Mother Mary , like us , was born in sin of sinful parents , but the Holy Spirit covered her , sanctified and purified her so that this child was born of flesh and blood , but not with sinful flesh and blood . The Holy Spirit permitted the Virgin Mary to remain a true , natural human being of flesh and blood , just as we . However , he warded off sin from her flesh and blood so that she became the mother of a pure child , not poisoned by sin as we are . For in that moment when she conceived , she was a holy mother filled with the Holy Spirit and her fruit is a holy pure fruit , at once God and truly man , in one person . " Some Lutherans , such as the members of the Anglo-Lutheran Catholic Church , support the doctrine .
In February 2016 , over a hundred thousand people signed a petition in just twenty-four hours , calling for a boycott of Sony Music and all other Sony-affiliated businesses after rape allegations against music producer Dr. Luke were made by musical artist Kesha . Kesha asked a New York City Supreme Court to free her from her contract with Sony Music but the court denied the request , prompting widespread public and media response .
Zinc is an essential mineral perceived by the public today as being of " exceptional biologic and public health importance " , especially regarding prenatal and postnatal development . Zinc deficiency affects about two billion people in the developing world and is associated with many diseases . In children it causes growth retardation , delayed sexual maturation , infection susceptibility , and diarrhea . Enzymes with a zinc atom in the reactive center are widespread in biochemistry , such as alcohol dehydrogenase in humans . Consumption of excess zinc can cause ataxia , lethargy and copper deficiency .
Though almost any variety of acoustic mandolin might be adequate for Irish traditional music , virtually all Irish players prefer flat-backed instruments with oval sound holes to the Italian-style bowl-back mandolins or the carved-top mandolins with f-holes favoured by bluegrass mandolinists . The former are often too soft-toned to hold their own in a session ( as well as having a tendency to not stay in place on the player 's lap ) , whilst the latter tend to sound harsh and overbearing to the traditional ear . The f-hole mandolin , however , does come into its own in a traditional session , where its brighter tone cuts through the sonic clutter of a pub . Greatly preferred for formal performance and recording are flat-topped " Irish-style " mandolins ( reminiscent of the WWI-era Martin Army-Navy mandolin ) and carved ( arch ) top mandolins with oval soundholes , such as the Gibson A-style of the 1920s .
With Rivera having been a linebacker with the Chicago Bears in Super Bowl XX , and Kubiak replacing Elway at the end of the Broncos ' defeats in Super Bowls XXI and XXIV , this will be the first Super Bowl in which both head coaches played in the game themselves .
Luther 's hymns inspired composers to write music . Johann Sebastian Bach included several verses as chorales in his cantatas and based chorale cantatas entirely on them , namely Christ lag in Todes Banden , BWV 4 , as early as possibly 1707 , in his second annual cycle ( 1724 to 1725 ) Ach Gott , vom Himmel sieh darein , BWV 2 , Christ unser Herr zum Jordan kam , BWV 7 , Nun komm , der Heiden Heiland , BWV 62 , Gelobet seist du , Jesu Christ , BWV 91 , and Aus tiefer Not schrei ich zu dir , BWV 38 , later Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott , BWV 80 , and in 1735 Wär Gott nicht mit uns diese Zeit , BWV 14 .
Hard rock developed into a major form of popular music in the 1970s , with bands such as Led Zeppelin , The Who , Deep Purple , Aerosmith , AC/DC and Van Halen . During the 1980s , some hard rock bands moved away from their hard rock roots and more towards pop rock , while others began to return to a hard rock sound . Established bands made a comeback in the mid-1980s and it reached a commercial peak in the 1980s , with glam metal bands like Bon Jovi and Def Leppard and the rawer sounds of Guns N ' Roses , which followed up with great success in the later part of that decade . Hard rock began losing popularity with the commercial success of grunge and later Britpop in the 1990s .
There is evidence of induced copper deficiency in those taking 100–300 mg of zinc daily . A 2007 trial observed that elderly men taking 80 mg daily were hospitalized for urinary complications more often than those taking a placebo . The USDA RDA is 11 and 8 mg Zn/day for men and women , respectively . Levels of 100–300 mg may interfere with the utilization of copper and iron or adversely affect cholesterol . Levels of zinc in excess of 500 ppm in soil interfere with the ability of plants to absorb other essential metals , such as iron and manganese . There is also a condition called the zinc shakes or " zinc chills " that can be induced by the inhalation of freshly formed zinc oxide formed during the welding of galvanized materials . Zinc is a common ingredient of denture cream which may contain between 17 and 38 mg of zinc per gram . There have been claims of disability , and even death , due to excessive use of these products .
Numerous communities of dark-skinned peoples are present in North Africa , some dating from prehistoric communities . Others are descendants of the historical Trans-Saharan trade in peoples and/or , and after the Arab invasions of North Africa in the 7th century , descendants of slaves from the Arab Slave Trade in North Africa .
Being identified as either " black " or " white " in Australia during the 19th and early 20th centuries was critical in one 's employment and social prospects . Various state-based Aboriginal Protection Boards were established which had virtually complete control over the lives of Indigenous Australians – where they lived , their employment , marriage , education and included the power to separate children from their parents . Aborigines were not allowed to vote and were often confined to reserves and forced into low paid or effectively slave labour . The social position of mixed-race or " half-caste " individuals varied over time . A 1913 report by Sir Baldwin Spencer states that :
UNFPA provided aid to Peru 's reproductive health program in the mid-to-late '90s . When it was discovered a Peruvian program had been engaged in carrying out coercive sterilizations , UNFPA called for reforms and protocols to protect the rights of women seeking assistance . UNFPA was not involved in the scandal , but continued work with the country after the abuses had become public to help end the abuses and reform laws and practices .
The Panthers defense gave up just 308 points , ranking sixth in the league , while also leading the NFL in interceptions with 24 and boasting four Pro Bowl selections . Pro Bowl defensive tackle Kawann Short led the team in sacks with 11 , while also forcing three fumbles and recovering two . Fellow lineman Mario Addison added 6½ sacks . The Panthers line also featured veteran defensive end Jared Allen , a 5-time pro bowler who was the NFL 's active career sack leader with 136 , along with defensive end Kony Ealy , who had 5 sacks in just 9 starts . Behind them , two of the Panthers three starting linebackers were also selected to play in the Pro Bowl : Thomas Davis and Luke Kuechly . Davis compiled 5½ sacks , four forced fumbles , and four interceptions , while Kuechly led the team in tackles ( 118 ) forced two fumbles , and intercepted four passes of his own . Carolina 's secondary featured Pro Bowl safety Kurt Coleman , who led the team with a career high seven interceptions , while also racking up 88 tackles and Pro Bowl cornerback Josh Norman , who developed into a shutdown corner during the season and had four interceptions , two of which were returned for touchdowns .
In contrast to the views of John Calvin and Philipp Melanchthon , throughout his life Luther maintained that it was not false doctrine to believe that a Christian 's soul sleeps after it is separated from the body in death ; and , accordingly , he disputed traditional interpretations of some Bible passages , such as the parable of the rich man and Lazarus . This also led Luther to reject the idea of torments for the saints : " It is enough for us to know that souls do not leave their bodies to be threatened by the torments and punishments of hell , but enter a prepared bedchamber in which they sleep in peace . " He also rejected the existence of Purgatory , which involved Christian souls undergoing penitential suffering after death . He affirmed the continuity of one 's personal identity beyond death . In his Smalcald Articles , he described the saints as currently residing " in their graves and in heaven . "

BSkyB utilises the VideoGuard pay-TV scrambling system owned by NDS , a Cisco Systems company . There are tight controls over use of VideoGuard decoders ; they are not available as stand-alone DVB CAMs ( conditional-access modules ) . BSkyB has design authority over all digital satellite receivers capable of receiving their service . The receivers , though designed and built by different manufacturers , must conform to the same user interface look-and-feel as all the others . This extends to the Personal video recorder ( PVR ) offering ( branded Sky+ ) .
On 8 February 2007 , BSkyB announced its intention to replace its three free-to-air digital terrestrial channels with four subscription channels . It was proposed that these channels would offer a range of content from the BSkyB portfolio including sport ( including English Premier League Football ) , films , entertainment and news . The announcement came a day after Setanta Sports confirmed that it would launch in March as a subscription service on the digital terrestrial platform , and on the same day that NTL 's services re-branded as Virgin Media . However , industry sources believe BSkyB will be forced to shelve plans to withdraw its channels from Freeview and replace them with subscription channels , due to possible lost advertising revenue .
To fill this gap in the literature , mandolin orchestras have traditionally played many arrangements of music written for regular orchestras or other ensembles . Some players have sought out contemporary composers to solicit new works . Traditional mandolin orchestras remain especially popular in Japan and Germany , but also exist throughout the United States , Europe and the rest of the world . They perform works composed for mandolin family instruments , or re-orchestrations of traditional pieces . The structure of a contemporary traditional mandolin orchestra consists of : first and second mandolins , mandolas ( either octave mandolas , tuned an octave below the mandolin , or tenor mandolas , tuned like the viola ) , mandocellos ( tuned like the cello ) , and bass instruments ( conventional string bass or , rarely , mandobasses ) . Smaller ensembles , such as quartets composed of two mandolins , mandola , and mandocello , may also be found .
Luther wrote " Ach Gott , vom Himmel sieh darein " ( " Oh God , look down from heaven " ) . " Nun komm , der Heiden Heiland " ( Now come , Savior of the gentiles ) , based on Veni redemptor gentium , became the main hymn ( Hauptlied ) for Advent . He transformed A solus ortus cardine to " Christum wir sollen loben schon " ( " We should now praise Christ " ) and Veni Creator Spiritus to " Komm , Gott Schöpfer , Heiliger Geist " ( " Come , Holy Spirit , Lord God " ) . He wrote two hymns on the Ten Commandments , " Dies sind die heilgen Zehn Gebot " and " Mensch , willst du leben seliglich " . His " Gelobet seist du , Jesu Christ " ( " Praise be to You , Jesus Christ " ) became the main hymn for Christmas . He wrote for Pentecost " Nun bitten wir den Heiligen Geist " , and adopted for Easter " Christ ist erstanden " ( Christ is risen ) , based on Victimae paschali laudes . " Mit Fried und Freud ich fahr dahin " , a paraphrase of Nunc dimittis , was intended for Purification , but became also a funeral hymn . He paraphrased the Te Deum as " Herr Gott , dich loben wir " with a simplified form of the melody . It became known as the German Te Deum .
In late November 2015 , reports surfaced stating that " multiple acts " would perform during the halftime show . On December 3 , the league confirmed that the show would be headlined by the British rock group Coldplay . On January 7 , 2016 , Pepsi confirmed to the Associated Press that Beyoncé , who headlined the Super Bowl XLVII halftime show and collaborated with Coldplay on the single " Hymn for the Weekend " , would be making an appearance . Bruno Mars , who headlined the Super Bowl XLVIII halftime show , and Mark Ronson also performed .
The Fund raises awareness of and supports efforts to meet these needs in developing countries , advocates close attention to population concerns , and helps developing nations formulate policies and strategies in support of sustainable development . Dr. Osotimehin assumed leadership in January 2011 . The Fund is also represented by UNFPA Goodwill Ambassadors and a Patron .

BSkyB 's digital service was officially launched on 1 October 1998 under the name Sky Digital , although small-scale tests were carried out before then . At this time the use of the Sky Digital brand made an important distinction between the new service and Sky 's analogue services . Key selling points were the improvement in picture and sound quality , increased number of channels and an interactive service branded Open ... . now called Sky Active , BSkyB competed with the ONdigital ( later ITV Digital ) terrestrial offering and cable services . Within 30 days , over 100,000 digiboxes had been sold , which help bolstered BSkyB 's decision to give away free digiboxes and minidishes from May 1999 .
However , according to then-Secretary of State Colin Powell , the UNFPA contributed vehicles and computers to the Chinese to carry out their population control policies . However , both the Washington Post and the Washington Times reported that Powell simply fell in line , signing a brief written by someone else .
From the end of World War II until 1971 , when John Rawls published A Theory of Justice , political philosophy declined in the Anglo-American academic world , as analytic philosophers expressed skepticism about the possibility that normative judgments had cognitive content , and political science turned toward statistical methods and behavioralism . In continental Europe , on the other hand , the postwar decades saw a huge blossoming of political philosophy , with Marxism dominating the field . This was the time of Jean-Paul Sartre and Louis Althusser , and the victories of Mao Zedong in China and Fidel Castro in Cuba , as well as the events of May 1968 led to increased interest in revolutionary ideology , especially by the New Left . A number of continental European émigrés to Britain and the United States—including Karl Popper , Friedrich Hayek , Leo Strauss , Isaiah Berlin , Eric Voegelin and Judith Shklar—encouraged continued study in political philosophy in the Anglo-American world , but in the 1950s and 1960s they and their students remained at odds with the analytic establishment .
In the United States , the game was televised by CBS , as part of a cycle between the three main broadcast television partners of the NFL . The network 's lead broadcast team of Jim Nantz and Phil Simms called the contest , with Tracy Wolfson and Evan Washburn on the sidelines . CBS introduced new features during the telecast , including pylon cameras and microphones along with EyeVision 360—an array of 36 cameras along the upper deck that can be used to provide a 360-degree view of plays and " bullet time " effects . ( An earlier version of EyeVision was last used in Super Bowl XXXV ; for Super Bowl 50 , the cameras were upgraded to 5K resolution . )

Egyptian music is a rich mixture of indigenous , Mediterranean , African and Western elements . It has been an integral part of Egyptian culture since antiquity . The ancient Egyptians credited one of their gods Hathor with the invention of music , which Osiris in turn used as part of his effort to civilise the world . Egyptians used music instruments since then . Contemporary Egyptian music traces its beginnings to the creative work of people such as Abdu El Hamouli , Almaz and Mahmoud Osman , who influenced the later work of Sayed Darwish , Umm Kulthum , Mohammed Abdel Wahab and Abdel Halim Hafez whose age is considered the golden age of music in Egypt and the whole Middle East and North-Africa . Prominent contemporary Egyptian pop singers include Amr Diab and Mohamed Mounir .
Due to the often political and cultural contours of blackness in the United States , the notion of blackness can also be extended to non-black people . Toni Morrison once described Bill Clinton as the first black President of the United States , because , as she put it , he displayed " almost every trope of blackness " . Christopher Hitchens was offended by the notion of Clinton as the first black president , noting , " Mr Clinton , according to Toni Morrison , the Nobel Prize-winning novelist , is our first black President , the first to come from the broken home , the alcoholic mother , the under-the-bridge shadows of our ranking systems . Thus , we may have lost the mystical power to divine diabolism , but we can still divine blackness by the following symptoms : broken homes , alcoholic mothers , under-the-bridge habits and ( presumable from the rest of [ Arthur ] Miller 's senescent musings ) the tendency to sexual predation and to shameless perjury about same . " Some black activists were also offended , claiming that Clinton used his knowledge of black culture to exploit black people for political gain as no other president had before , while not serving black interests . They cite the lack of action during the Rwandan Genocide and his welfare reform , which Larry Roberts said had led to the worst child poverty since the 1960s . Others cited that the number of black people in jail increased during his administration .

The Super Bowl 50 Host Committee has vowed to be " the most giving Super Bowl ever " , and will dedicate 25 percent of all money it raises for philanthropic causes in the Bay Area . The committee created the 50 fund as its philanthropic initiative and focuses on providing grants to aid with youth development , community investment and sustainable environments .
Although not yet tested as a therapy in humans , a growing body of evidence indicates that zinc may preferentially kill prostate cancer cells . Because zinc naturally homes to the prostate and because the prostate is accessible with relatively non-invasive procedures , its potential as a chemotherapeutic agent in this type of cancer has shown promise . However , other studies have demonstrated that chronic use of zinc supplements in excess of the recommended dosage may actually increase the chance of developing prostate cancer , also likely due to the natural buildup of this heavy metal in the prostate .
In the United States , the game was televised by CBS , as part of a cycle between the three main broadcast television partners of the NFL . The network 's lead broadcast team of Jim Nantz and Phil Simms called the contest , with Tracy Wolfson and Evan Washburn on the sidelines . CBS introduced new features during the telecast , including pylon cameras and microphones along with EyeVision 360—an array of 36 cameras along the upper deck that can be used to provide a 360-degree view of plays and " bullet time " effects . ( An earlier version of EyeVision was last used in Super Bowl XXXV ; for Super Bowl 50 , the cameras were upgraded to 5K resolution . )
Kenneth Gergen formulated additional classifications , which include the strategic manipulator , the pastiche personality , and the relational self . The strategic manipulator is a person who begins to regard all senses of identity merely as role-playing exercises , and who gradually becomes alienated from his or her social " self " . The pastiche personality abandons all aspirations toward a true or " essential " identity , instead viewing social interactions as opportunities to play out , and hence become , the roles they play . Finally , the relational self is a perspective by which persons abandon all sense of exclusive self , and view all sense of identity in terms of social engagement with others . For Gergen , these strategies follow one another in phases , and they are linked to the increase in popularity of postmodern culture and the rise of telecommunications technology .
Publius Vergilius Maro ( Classical Latin : [ ˈpuː.blɪ.ʊs wɛrˈɡɪ.lɪ.ʊs ˈma.roː ] ; October 15 , 70 BC – September 21 , 19 BC ) , usually called Virgil or Vergil /ˈvɜːrdʒᵻl/ in English , was an ancient Roman poet of the Augustan period . He is known for three major works of Latin literature , the Eclogues ( or Bucolics ) , the Georgics , and the epic Aeneid . A number of minor poems , collected in the Appendix Vergiliana , are sometimes attributed to him .
To fill this gap in the literature , mandolin orchestras have traditionally played many arrangements of music written for regular orchestras or other ensembles . Some players have sought out contemporary composers to solicit new works . Traditional mandolin orchestras remain especially popular in Japan and Germany , but also exist throughout the United States , Europe and the rest of the world . They perform works composed for mandolin family instruments , or re-orchestrations of traditional pieces . The structure of a contemporary traditional mandolin orchestra consists of : first and second mandolins , mandolas ( either octave mandolas , tuned an octave below the mandolin , or tenor mandolas , tuned like the viola ) , mandocellos ( tuned like the cello ) , and bass instruments ( conventional string bass or , rarely , mandobasses ) . Smaller ensembles , such as quartets composed of two mandolins , mandola , and mandocello , may also be found .
Much of mandolin development revolved around the soundboard ( the top ) . Pre-mandolin instruments were quiet instruments , strung with as many as six courses of gut strings , and were plucked with the fingers or with a quill . However , modern instruments are louder—using four courses of metal strings , which exert more pressure than the gut strings . The modern soundboard is designed to withstand the pressure of metal strings that would break earlier instruments . The soundboard comes in many shapes—but generally round or teardrop-shaped , sometimes with scrolls or other projections . There is usually one or more sound holes in the soundboard , either round , oval , or shaped like a calligraphic F ( f-hole ) . A round or oval sound hole may be covered or bordered with decorative rosettes or purfling .

Foreign direct investment ( FDI ) in Egypt increased considerably before the removal of Hosni Mubarak , exceeding $ 6 billion in 2006 , due to economic liberalisation and privatisation measures taken by minister of investment Mahmoud Mohieddin . [ citation needed ] Since the fall of Hosni Mubarak in 2011 , Egypt has experienced a drastic fall in both foreign investment and tourism revenues , followed by a 60 % drop in foreign exchange reserves , a 3 % drop in growth , and a rapid devaluation of the Egyptian pound .
It seems to have been St Bernard of Clairvaux who , in the 12th century , explicitly raised the question of the Immaculate Conception . A feast of the Conception of the Blessed Virgin had already begun to be celebrated in some churches of the West . St Bernard blames the canons of the metropolitan church of Lyon for instituting such a festival without the permission of the Holy See . In doing so , he takes occasion to repudiate altogether the view that the conception of Mary was sinless . It is doubtful , however , whether he was using the term " conception " in the same sense in which it is used in the definition of Pope Pius IX . Bernard would seem to have been speaking of conception in the active sense of the mother 's cooperation , for in his argument he says : " How can there be absence of sin where there is concupiscence ( libido ) ? " and stronger expressions follow , showing that he is speaking of the mother and not of the child .
Samuel Adelstein described the Lombardi mandolin in 1893 as wider and shorter than the Neapolitan mandolin , with a shallower back and a shorter and wider neck , with six single strings to the regular mandolin 's set of 4 . The Lombardi was tuned C , D , A , E , B , G. The strings were fastened to the bridge like a guitar 's . There were 20 frets , covering three octaves , with an additional 5 notes . When Adelstein wrote , there were no nylon strings , and the gut and single strings " do not vibrate so clearly and sweetly as the double steel string of the Neapolitan . "
Luther objected to a saying attributed to Johann Tetzel that " As soon as the coin in the coffer rings , the soul from purgatory ( also attested as 'into heaven ' ) springs . "
No archaeological evidence that indicates a settlement on the site of today′s city centre prior to the 12th century has been found so far . In antiquity , a Celtic oppidum stood on the Engehalbinsel ( peninsula ) north of Bern , fortified since the 2nd century BC ( late La Tène period ) , thought to be one of the twelve oppida of the Helvetii mentioned by Caesar . During the Roman era , there was a Gallo-Roman vicus on the same site . The Bern zinc tablet has the name Brenodor ( " dwelling of Breno " ) . In the Early Middle Ages , there was a settlement in Bümpliz , now a city district of Bern , some 4 km ( 2 mi ) from the medieval city .
The Panthers offense , which led the NFL in scoring ( 500 points ) , was loaded with talent , boasting six Pro Bowl selections . Pro Bowl quarterback Cam Newton had one of his best seasons , throwing for 3,837 yards and rushing for 636 , while recording a career-high and league-leading 45 total touchdowns ( 35 passing , 10 rushing ) , a career-low 10 interceptions , and a career-best quarterback rating of 99.4 . Newton 's leading receivers were tight end Greg Olsen , who caught a career-high 77 passes for 1,104 yards and seven touchdowns , and wide receiver Ted Ginn , Jr. , who caught 44 passes for 739 yards and 10 touchdowns ; Ginn also rushed for 60 yards and returned 27 punts for 277 yards . Other key receivers included veteran Jerricho Cotchery ( 39 receptions for 485 yards ) , rookie Devin Funchess ( 31 receptions for 473 yards and five touchdowns ) , and second-year receiver Corey Brown ( 31 receptions for 447 yards ) . The Panthers backfield featured Pro Bowl running back Jonathan Stewart , who led the team with 989 rushing yards and six touchdowns in 13 games , along with Pro Bowl fullback Mike Tolbert , who rushed for 256 yards and caught 18 passes for another 154 yards . Carolina 's offensive line also featured two Pro Bowl selections : center Ryan Kalil and guard Trai Turner .
In July 2013 , the English High Court of Justice found that Microsoft ’ s use of the term " SkyDrive " infringed on Sky ’ s right to the " Sky " trademark . On 31 July 2013 , BSkyB and Microsoft announced their settlement , in which Microsoft will not appeal the ruling , and will rename its SkyDrive cloud storage service after an unspecified " reasonable period of time to allow for an orderly transition to a new brand , " plus " financial and other terms , the details of which are confidential " . On 27 January 2014 , Microsoft announced " that SkyDrive will soon become OneDrive " and " SkyDrive Pro " becomes " OneDrive for Business " .
According to the tradition , Virgil traveled to Greece in about 19 BC to revise the Aeneid . After meeting Augustus in Athens and deciding to return home , Virgil caught a fever while visiting a town near Megara . After crossing to Italy by ship , weakened with disease , Virgil died in Brundisium harbor on September 21 , 19 BC . Augustus ordered Virgil 's literary executors , Lucius Varius Rufus and Plotius Tucca , to disregard Virgil 's own wish that the poem be burned , instead ordering it published with as few editorial changes as possible . As a result , the text of the Aeneid that exists may contain faults which Virgil was planning to correct before publication . However , the only obvious imperfections are a few lines of verse that are metrically unfinished ( i.e . not a complete line of dactylic hexameter ) . Some scholars have argued that Virgil deliberately left these metrically incomplete lines for dramatic effect . Other alleged imperfections are subject to scholarly debate .
Luther 's disappearance during his return trip back to Wittenberg was planned . Frederick III had him intercepted on his way home in the forest near Wittenberg by masked horsemen who were made to appear as armed highwaymen . They escorted Luther to the security of the Wartburg Castle at Eisenach . During his stay at Wartburg , which he referred to as " my Patmos " , Luther translated the New Testament from Greek into German and poured out doctrinal and polemical writings . These included a renewed attack on Archbishop Albrecht of Mainz , whom he shamed into halting the sale of indulgences in his episcopates , and a " Refutation of the Argument of Latomus , " in which he expounded the principle of justification to Jacobus Latomus , an orthodox theologian from Louvain .
The Panthers seemed primed to score on their opening drive of the second half when Newton completed a 45-yard pass to Ted Ginn Jr. on the Denver 35-yard line on their second offensive play . But the Broncos defense halted the drive on the 26-yard line , and it ended with no points when Graham Gano hit the uprights on a 44-yard field goal attempt . After the miss , Manning completed a pair of passes to Emmanuel Sanders for gains of 25 and 22 yards , setting up McManus ' 33-yard field goal that gave the Broncos a 16–7 lead . Carolina got off to another strong start after the kickoff , with Newton completing a 42-yard pass to Corey Brown . But once again they came up empty , this time as a result of a Newton pass that bounced off the hands of Ginn and was intercepted by safety T. J . Ward . Ward fumbled the ball during the return , but Trevathan recovered it to enable Denver to keep possession .
Some Western writers claim that the immaculate conception of Mary is a teaching of Islam . Thus , commenting in 1734 on the passage in the Qur'an , " I have called her Mary ; and I commend her to thy protection , and also her issue , against Satan driven away with stones " , George Sale stated : " It is not improbable that the pretended immaculate conception of the virgin Mary is intimated in this passage . For according to a tradition of Mohammed , every person that comes into the world , is touched at his birth by the devil , and therefore cries out , Mary and her son only excepted ; between whom , and the evil spirit God placed a veil , so that his touch did not reach them . And for this reason they say , neither of them were guilty of any sin , like the rest of the children of Adam . "
The flagship stations of each station in the markets of each team will carry their local play-by-play calls . In Denver , KOA ( 850 AM ) and KRFX ( 103.5 FM ) will carry the game , with Dave Logan on play-by-play and Ed McCaffrey on color commentary . In North Carolina , WBT ( 1110 AM ) will carry the game , with Mick Mixon on play-by-play and Eugene Robinson and Jim Szoke on color commentary . WBT will also simulcast the game on its sister station WBT-FM ( 99.3 FM ) , which is based in Chester , South Carolina . As KOA and WBT are both clear-channel stations , the local broadcasts will be audible over much of the western United States after sunset ( for Denver ) and the eastern United States throughout the game ( for Carolina ) . In accordance with contractual rules , the rest of the stations in the Broncos and Panthers radio networks will either carry the Westwood One feed or not carry the game at all .
Martin Luther ( /ˈluːθər/ or /ˈluːðər/ ; German : [ ˈmaɐ̯tiːn ˈlʊtɐ ] ( listen ) ; 10 November 1483 – 18 February 1546 ) was a German professor of theology , composer , priest , former monk and a seminal figure in the Protestant Reformation . Luther came to reject several teachings and practices of the Late Medieval Catholic Church . He strongly disputed the claim that freedom from God 's punishment for sin could be purchased with money . He proposed an academic discussion of the power and usefulness of indulgences in his Ninety-Five Theses of 1517 . His refusal to retract all of his writings at the demand of Pope Leo X in 1520 and the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V at the Diet of Worms in 1521 resulted in his excommunication by the Pope and condemnation as an outlaw by the Emperor .
Anthropologists have contributed to the debate by shifting the focus of research : One of the first challenges for the researcher wishing to carry out empirical research in this area is to identify an appropriate analytical tool . The concept of boundaries is useful here for demonstrating how identity works . In the same way as Barth , in his approach to ethnicity , advocated the critical focus for investigation as being " the ethnic boundary that defines the group rather than the cultural stuff that it encloses " ( 1969:15 ) , social anthropologists such as Cohen and Bray have shifted the focus of analytical study from identity to the boundaries that are used for purposes of identification . If identity is a kind of virtual site in which the dynamic processes and markers used for identification are made apparent , boundaries provide the framework on which this virtual site is built . They concentrated on how the idea of community belonging is differently constructed by individual members and how individuals within the group conceive ethnic boundaries .
Many adaptations of the instrument have been done to cater to the special needs of Indian Carnatic music . In Indian classical music and Indian light music , the mandolin , which bears little resemblance to the European mandolin , is usually tuned E-B-E-B . As there is no concept of absolute pitch in Indian classical music , any convenient tuning maintaining these relative pitch intervals between the strings can be used . Another prevalent tuning with these intervals is C-G-C-G , which corresponds to Sa-Pa-Sa-Pa in the Indian carnatic classical music style . This tuning corresponds to the way violins are tuned for carnatic classical music . This type of mandolin is also used in Bhangra , dance music popular in Punjabi culture .
On 15 June 1520 , the Pope warned Luther with the papal bull ( edict ) Exsurge Domine that he risked excommunication unless he recanted 41 sentences drawn from his writings , including the 95 Theses , within 60 days . That autumn , Johann Eck proclaimed the bull in Meissen and other towns . Karl von Miltitz , a papal nuncio , attempted to broker a solution , but Luther , who had sent the Pope a copy of On the Freedom of a Christian in October , publicly set fire to the bull and decretals at Wittenberg on 10 December 1520 , an act he defended in Why the Pope and his Recent Book are Burned and Assertions Concerning All Articles . As a consequence , Luther was excommunicated by Pope Leo X on 3 January 1521 , in the bull Decet Romanum Pontificem .
Though almost any variety of acoustic mandolin might be adequate for Irish traditional music , virtually all Irish players prefer flat-backed instruments with oval sound holes to the Italian-style bowl-back mandolins or the carved-top mandolins with f-holes favoured by bluegrass mandolinists . The former are often too soft-toned to hold their own in a session ( as well as having a tendency to not stay in place on the player 's lap ) , whilst the latter tend to sound harsh and overbearing to the traditional ear . The f-hole mandolin , however , does come into its own in a traditional session , where its brighter tone cuts through the sonic clutter of a pub . Greatly preferred for formal performance and recording are flat-topped " Irish-style " mandolins ( reminiscent of the WWI-era Martin Army-Navy mandolin ) and carved ( arch ) top mandolins with oval soundholes , such as the Gibson A-style of the 1920s .
As African states became independent in the 1960s , the Soviet Union offered many of their citizens the chance to study in Russia . Over a period of 40 years , about 400,000 African students from various countries moved to Russia to pursue higher studies , including many Black Africans . This extended beyond the Soviet Union to many countries of the Eastern bloc .
20th Century Fox , Lionsgate , Paramount Pictures , Universal Studios and Walt Disney Studios paid for movie trailers to be aired during the Super Bowl . Fox paid for Deadpool , X-Men : Apocalypse , Independence Day : Resurgence and Eddie the Eagle , Lionsgate paid for Gods of Egypt , Paramount paid for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles : Out of the Shadows and 10 Cloverfield Lane , Universal paid for The Secret Life of Pets and the debut trailer for Jason Bourne and Disney paid for Captain America : Civil War , The Jungle Book and Alice Through the Looking Glass .

Isidore of Seville , writing in the 7th century , claimed that the Latin word Maurus was derived from the Greek mauron , μαύρον , which is the Greek word for black . Indeed , by the time Isidore of Seville came to write his Etymologies , the word Maurus or " Moor " had become an adjective in Latin , " for the Greeks call black , mauron " . " In Isidore ’ s day , Moors were black by definition… "
While these few hard rock bands managed to maintain success and popularity in the early part of the decade , alternative forms of hard rock achieved mainstream success in the form of grunge in the US and Britpop in the UK . This was particularly evident after the success of Nirvana 's Nevermind ( 1991 ) , which combined elements of hardcore punk and heavy metal into a " dirty " sound that made use of heavy guitar distortion , fuzz and feedback , along with darker lyrical themes than their " hair band " predecessors . Although most grunge bands had a sound that sharply contrasted mainstream hard rock , several , including Pearl Jam , Alice in Chains , Mother Love Bone and Soundgarden , were more strongly influenced by 1970s and 1980s rock and metal , while Stone Temple Pilots managed to turn alternative rock into a form of stadium rock . However , all grunge bands shunned the macho , anthemic and fashion-focused aesthetics particularly associated with glam metal . In the UK , Oasis were unusual among the Britpop bands of the mid-1990s in incorporating a hard rock sound .
Luther 's 1541 hymn " Christ unser Herr zum Jordan kam " ( " To Jordan came the Christ our Lord " ) reflects the structure and substance of his questions and answers concerning baptism in the Small Catechism . Luther adopted a preexisting Johann Walter tune associated with a hymnic setting of Psalm 67 's prayer for grace ; Wolf Heintz 's four-part setting of the hymn was used to introduce the Lutheran Reformation in Halle in 1541 . Preachers and composers of the 18th century , including J. S. Bach , used this rich hymn as a subject for their own work , although its objective baptismal theology was displaced by more subjective hymns under the influence of late-19th-century Lutheran pietism .
The expansion of mandolin use continued after World War II through the late 1960s , and Japan still maintains a strong classical music tradition using mandolins , with active orchestras and university music programs . New orchestras were founded and new orchestral compositions composed . Japanese mandolin orchestras today may consist of up to 40 or 50 members , and can include woodwind , percussion , and brass sections . Japan also maintains an extensive collection of 20th Century mandolin music from Europe and one of the most complete collections of mandolin magazines from mandolin 's golden age , purchased by Morishige Takei .

Ealy was the top defensive performer for Carolina with four total tackles , three sacks , a forced fumble , a fumble recovery , and an interception . Defensive End Charles Johnson had four total tackles , a sack , and a forced fumble . Linebacker Luke Kuechly had 11 total tackles , while Thomas Davis had seven , despite playing just two weeks after breaking his right arm in the NFC title game .
Various gold-themed promotions and initiatives were held throughout the 2015 NFL season to tie into the " Golden Super Bowl " ; gold-tinted logos were implemented across the NFL 's properties and painted on fields , the numbering of the 50-yard line on fields was colored gold , and beginning on week 7 , all sideline jackets and hats featured gold-trimmed logos . Gold footballs were given to each high school that has had a player or coach appear in the Super Bowl , and " homecoming " events were also held by Super Bowl-winning teams at games .
The Canton of Bern school system provides one year of non-obligatory kindergarten , followed by six years of primary school . This is followed by three years of obligatory lower secondary school where the pupils are separated according to ability and aptitude . Following the lower secondary pupils may attend additional schooling or they may enter an apprenticeship .
Luther made his pronouncements from Wartburg in the context of rapid developments at Wittenberg , of which he was kept fully informed . Andreas Karlstadt , supported by the ex-Augustinian Gabriel Zwilling , embarked on a radical programme of reform there in June 1521 , exceeding anything envisaged by Luther . The reforms provoked disturbances , including a revolt by the Augustinian friars against their prior , the smashing of statues and images in churches , and denunciations of the magistracy . After secretly visiting Wittenberg in early December 1521 , Luther wrote A Sincere Admonition by Martin Luther to All Christians to Guard Against Insurrection and Rebellion . Wittenberg became even more volatile after Christmas when a band of visionary zealots , the so-called Zwickau prophets , arrived , preaching revolutionary doctrines such as the equality of man , adult baptism , and Christ 's imminent return . When the town council asked Luther to return , he decided it was his duty to act .

In honor of the 50th Super Bowl , the pregame ceremony featured the on-field introduction of 39 of the 43 previous Super Bowl Most Valuable Players . Bart Starr ( MVP of Super Bowls I and II ) and Chuck Howley ( MVP of Super Bowl V ) appeared via video , while Peyton Manning ( MVP of Super Bowl XLI and current Broncos quarterback ) was shown in the locker room preparing for the game . No plans were announced regarding the recognition of Harvey Martin , co-MVP of Super Bowl XII , who died in 2001 .
On the island of Crete , along with the lyra and the laouto ( lute ) , the mandolin is one of the main instruments used in Cretan Music . It appeared on Crete around the time of the Venetian rule of the island . Different variants of the mandolin , such as the " mantola , " were used to accompany the lyra , the violin , and the laouto . Stelios Foustalierakis reported that the mandolin and the mpoulgari were used to accompany the lyra in the beginning of the 20th century in the city of Rethimno . There are also reports that the mandolin was mostly a woman 's musical instrument . Nowadays it is played mainly as a solo instrument in personal and family events on the Ionian islands and Crete .
The Broncos defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers in the divisional round , 23–16 , by scoring 11 points in the final three minutes of the game . They then beat the defending Super Bowl XLIX champion New England Patriots in the AFC Championship Game , 20–18 , by intercepting a pass on New England 's 2-point conversion attempt with 17 seconds left on the clock . Despite Manning 's problems with interceptions during the season , he did n't throw any in their two playoff games .
Instruments were marketed by teacher-dealers , much as the title character in the popular musical The Music Man . Often , these teacher-dealers conducted mandolin orchestras : groups of 4-50 musicians who played various mandolin family instruments . However , alongside the teacher-dealers were serious musicians , working to create a spot for the instrument in classical music , ragtime and jazz . Like the teacher-dealers , they traveled the U.S. , recording records , giving performances and teaching individuals and mandolin orchestras . Samuel Siegel played mandolin in Vaudeville and became one of America 's preeminent mandolinists . Seth Weeks was an African American who not only taught and performed in the United States , but also in Europe , where he recorded records . Another pioneering African American musician and director who made his start with a mandolin orchestra was composer James Reese Europe . W. Eugene Page toured the country with a group , and was well known for his mandolin and mandola performances . Other names include Valentine Abt , Samuel Adelstein , William Place , Jr. , and Aubrey Stauffer .
This was the first Super Bowl to feature a quarterback on both teams who was the # 1 pick in their draft classes . Manning was the # 1 selection of the 1998 NFL draft , while Newton was picked first in 2011 . The matchup also pits the top two picks of the 2011 draft against each other : Newton for Carolina and Von Miller for Denver . Manning and Newton also set the record for the largest age difference between opposing Super Bowl quarterbacks at 13 years and 48 days ( Manning was 39 , Newton was 26 ) .
Peyton Manning became the first quarterback ever to lead two different teams to multiple Super Bowls . He is also the oldest quarterback ever to play in a Super Bowl at age 39 . The past record was held by John Elway , who led the Broncos to victory in Super Bowl XXXIII at age 38 and is currently Denver 's Executive Vice President of Football Operations and General Manager .
In 1839 Mariano Spada ( 1796 - 1872 ) , professor of theology at the Roman College of Saint Thomas , published Esame Critico sulla dottrina dell ’ Angelico Dottore S. Tommaso di Aquino circa il Peccato originale , relativamente alla Beatissima Vergine Maria [ A critical examination of the doctrine of St. Thomas Aquinas , the Angelic Doctor , regarding original sin with respect to the Most Blessed Virgin Mary ] , in which Aquinas is interpreted not as treating the question of the Immaculate Conception later formulated in the papal bull Ineffabilis Deus but rather the sanctification of the fetus within Mary 's womb . Spada furnished an interpretation whereby Pius IX was relieved of the problem of seeming to foster a doctrine not in agreement with the Aquinas ' teaching . Pope Pius IX would later appoint Spada Master of the Sacred Palace in 1867 .
Luther had been suffering from ill health for years , including Ménière 's disease , vertigo , fainting , tinnitus , and a cataract in one eye . From 1531 to 1546 , his health deteriorated further . The years of struggle with Rome , the antagonisms with and among his fellow reformers , and the scandal which ensued from the bigamy of the Philip of Hesse incident , in which Luther had played a leading role , all may have contributed . In 1536 , he began to suffer from kidney and bladder stones , and arthritis , and an ear infection ruptured an ear drum . In December 1544 , he began to feel the effects of angina .
In previous times , at the consistory at which the pope named a new cardinal , he would bestow upon him a distinctive wide-brimmed hat called a galero . This custom was discontinued in 1969 and the investiture now takes place with the scarlet biretta . In ecclesiastical heraldry , however , the scarlet galero is still displayed on the cardinal 's coat of arms . Cardinals had the right to display the galero in their cathedral , and when a cardinal died , it would be suspended from the ceiling above his tomb . Some cardinals will still have a galero made , even though it is not officially part of their apparel . [ citation needed ]
The Suez Canal is an artificial sea-level waterway in Egypt considered the most important centre of the maritime transport in the Middle East , connecting the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea . Opened in November 1869 after 10 years of construction work , it allows ship transport between Europe and Asia without navigation around Africa . The northern terminus is Port Said and the southern terminus is Port Tawfiq at the city of Suez . Ismailia lies on its west bank , 3 km ( 1.9 mi ) from the half-way point .

Over the past two years , [ clarification needed ] dozens of rights-holders , including Sony Music , have sent complaints about Wikipedia.org directly to Google to have content removed .
Carolina suffered a major setback when Thomas Davis , an 11-year veteran who had already overcome three ACL tears in his career , went down with a broken arm in the NFC Championship Game . Despite this , he insisted he would still find a way to play in the Super Bowl . His prediction turned out to be accurate .
Other major bluegrass mandolinists who emerged in the early 1950s and are still active include Jesse McReynolds ( of Jim and Jesse ) who invented a syncopated banjo-roll-like style called crosspicking—and Bobby Osborne of the Osborne Brothers , who is a master of clarity and sparkling single-note runs . Highly respected and influential modern bluegrass players include Herschel Sizemore , Doyle Lawson , and the multi-genre Sam Bush , who is equally at home with old-time fiddle tunes , rock , reggae , and jazz . Ronnie McCoury of the Del McCoury Band has won numerous awards for his Monroe-influenced playing . The late John Duffey of the original Country Gentlemen and later the Seldom Scene did much to popularize the bluegrass mandolin among folk and urban audiences , especially on the east coast and in the Washington , D.C. area .
Like any plucked instrument , mandolin notes decay to silence rather than sound out continuously as with a bowed note on a violin , and mandolin notes decay faster than larger stringed instruments like the guitar . This encourages the use of tremolo ( rapid picking of one or more pairs of strings ) to create sustained notes or chords . The mandolin 's paired strings facilitate this technique : the plectrum ( pick ) strikes each of a pair of strings alternately , providing a more full and continuous sound than a single string would .
The implications are multiple as various research traditions are now [ when ? ] heavily utilizing the lens of identity to examine phenomena . [ citation needed ] One implication of identity and of identity construction can be seen in occupational settings . This becomes increasing challenging in stigmatized jobs or " dirty work " ( Hughes , 1951 ) . Tracy and Trethewey ( 2005 ) state that " individuals gravitate toward and turn away from particular jobs depending in part , on the extent to which they validate a " preferred organizational self " ( Tracy & Tretheway 2005 , p. 169 ) . Some jobs carry different stigmas or acclaims . In her analysis Tracy uses the example of correctional officers trying to shake the stigma of " glorified maids " ( Tracy & Tretheway 2005 ) . " The process by which people arrive at justifications of and values for various occupational choices . " Among these are workplace satisfaction and overall quality of life ( Tracy & Scott 2006 , p. 33 ) . People in these types of jobs are forced to find ways in order to create an identity they can live with . " Crafting a positive sense of self at work is more challenging when one 's work is considered " dirty " by societal standards " ( Tracy & Scott 2006 , p. 7 ) . " In other words , doing taint management is not just about allowing the employee to feel good in that job . " If employees must navigate discourses that question the viability of their work , and/ or experience obstacles in managing taint through transforming dirty work into a badge of honor , it is likely they will find blaming the client to be an efficacious route in affirming their identity " ( Tracy & Scott 2006 , p. 33 ) .
In 1542 , Luther read a Latin translation of the Qur'an . He went on to produce several critical pamphlets on Islam , which he called " Mohammedanism " or " the Turk " . Though Luther saw the Muslim faith as a tool of the devil , he was indifferent to its practice : " Let the Turk believe and live as he will , just as one lets the papacy and other false Christians live . " He opposed banning the publication of the Qur'an , wanting it exposed to scrutiny .
UNFPA has been falsely accused by anti-family planning groups of providing support for government programs which have promoted forced-abortions and coercive sterilizations . Controversies regarding these claims have resulted in a sometimes shaky relationship between the organization and three presidential administrations , that of Ronald Reagan , George H. W. Bush and George W. Bush , withholding funding from the UNFPA .
Being identified as either " black " or " white " in Australia during the 19th and early 20th centuries was critical in one 's employment and social prospects . Various state-based Aboriginal Protection Boards were established which had virtually complete control over the lives of Indigenous Australians – where they lived , their employment , marriage , education and included the power to separate children from their parents . Aborigines were not allowed to vote and were often confined to reserves and forced into low paid or effectively slave labour . The social position of mixed-race or " half-caste " individuals varied over time . A 1913 report by Sir Baldwin Spencer states that :
Luther 's Small Catechism proved especially effective in helping parents teach their children ; likewise the Larger Catechism was effective for pastors . Using the German vernacular , they expressed the Apostles ' Creed in simpler , more personal , Trinitarian language . He rewrote each article of the Creed to express the character of the Father , the Son , or the Holy Spirit . Luther 's goal was to enable the catechumens to see themselves as a personal object of the work of the three persons of the Trinity , each of which works in the catechumen 's life . That is , Luther depicted the Trinity not as a doctrine to be learned , but as persons to be known . The Father creates , the Son redeems , and the Spirit sanctifies , a divine unity with separate personalities . Salvation originates with the Father and draws the believer to the Father . Luther 's treatment of the Apostles ' Creed must be understood in the context of the Decalogue ( the Ten Commandments ) and the Lord 's Prayer , which are also part of the Lutheran catechical teaching .
Alloys of primarily zinc with small amounts of copper , aluminium , and magnesium are useful in die casting as well as spin casting , especially in the automotive , electrical , and hardware industries . These alloys are marketed under the name Zamak . An example of this is zinc aluminium . The low melting point together with the low viscosity of the alloy makes the production of small and intricate shapes possible . The low working temperature leads to rapid cooling of the cast products and therefore fast assembly is possible . Another alloy , marketed under the brand name Prestal , contains 78 % zinc and 22 % aluminium and is reported to be nearly as strong as steel but as malleable as plastic . This superplasticity of the alloy allows it to be molded using die casts made of ceramics and cement .
The roots of hard rock can be traced back to the 1950s , particularly electric blues , which laid the foundations for key elements such as a rough declamatory vocal style , heavy guitar riffs , string-bending blues-scale guitar solos , strong beat , thick riff-laden texture , and posturing performances . Electric blues guitarists began experimenting with hard rock elements such as driving rhythms , distorted guitar solos and power chords in the 1950s , evident in the work of Memphis blues guitarists such as Joe Hill Louis , Willie Johnson , and particularly Pat Hare , who captured a " grittier , nastier , more ferocious electric guitar sound " on records such as James Cotton 's " Cotton Crop Blues " ( 1954 ) . Other antecedents include Link Wray 's instrumental " Rumble " in 1958 , and the surf rock instrumentals of Dick Dale , such as " Let 's Go Trippin ' " ( 1961 ) and " Misirlou " ( 1962 ) .
The Egyptian military has dozens of factories manufacturing weapons as well as consumer goods . The Armed Forces ' inventory includes equipment from different countries around the world . Equipment from the former Soviet Union is being progressively replaced by more modern US , French , and British equipment , a significant portion of which is built under license in Egypt , such as the M1 Abrams tank . [ citation needed ] Relations with Russia have improved significantly following Mohamed Morsi 's removal and both countries have worked since then to strengthen military and trade ties among other aspects of bilateral co-operation . Relations with China have also improved considerably . In 2014 , Egypt and China have established a bilateral " comprehensive strategic partnership " .
Brass , which is an alloy of copper and zinc , has been used since at least the 10th century BC in Judea and by the 7th century BC in Ancient Greece . Zinc metal was not produced on a large scale until the 12th century in India and was unknown to Europe until the end of the 16th century . The mines of Rajasthan have given definite evidence of zinc production going back to the 6th century BC . To date , the oldest evidence of pure zinc comes from Zawar , in Rajasthan , as early as the 9th century AD when a distillation process was employed to make pure zinc . Alchemists burned zinc in air to form what they called " philosopher 's wool " or " white snow " .
On 18 January 2014 , the interim government successfully institutionalised a more secular constitution . The president is elected to a four-year term and may serve 2 terms . The parliament may impeach the president . Under the constitution , there is a guarantee of gender equality and absolute freedom of thought . The military retains the ability to appoint the national Minister of Defence for the next 8 years . Under the constitution , political parties may not be based on " religion , race , gender or geography " .

In 525 BC , the powerful Achaemenid Persians , led by Cambyses II , began their conquest of Egypt , eventually capturing the pharaoh Psamtik III at the battle of Pelusium . Cambyses II then assumed the formal title of pharaoh , but ruled Egypt from his home of Susa in Persia ( modern Iran ) , leaving Egypt under the control of a satrapy . The entire Twenty-seventh Dynasty of Egypt , from 525 BC to 402 BC , save for Petubastis III , was an entirely Persian ruled period , with the Achaemenid kings all being granted the title of pharaoh . A few temporarily successful revolts against the Persians marked the fifth century BC , but Egypt was never able to permanently overthrow the Persians .
Some rock musicians today use mandolins , often single-stringed electric models rather than double-stringed acoustic mandolins . One example is Tim Brennan of the Irish-American punk rock band Dropkick Murphys . In addition to electric guitar , bass , and drums , the band uses several instruments associated with traditional Celtic music , including mandolin , tin whistle , and Great Highland bagpipes . The band explains that these instruments accentuate the growling sound they favor . The 1991 R.E.M . hit " Losing My Religion " was driven by a few simple mandolin licks played by guitarist Peter Buck , who also played the mandolin in nearly a dozen other songs . The single peaked at No . 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart ( # 1 on the rock and alternative charts ) , Luther Dickinson of North Mississippi Allstars and The Black Crowes has made frequent use of the mandolin , most notably on the Black Crowes song " Locust Street . " Armenian American rock group System of A Down makes extensive use of the mandolin on their 2005 double album Mezmerize/Hypnotize . Pop punk band Green Day has used a mandolin in several occasions , especially on their 2000 album , Warning . Boyd Tinsley , violin player of the Dave Matthews Band has been using an electric mandolin since 2005 . Frontman Colin Meloy and guitarist Chris Funk of The Decemberists regularly employ the mandolin in the band 's music . Nancy Wilson , rhythm guitarist of Heart , uses a mandolin in Heart 's song " Dream of the Archer " from the album Little Queen , as well as in Heart 's cover of Led Zeppelin 's song " The Battle of Evermore . " " Show Me Heaven " by Maria McKee , the theme song to the film Days of Thunder , prominently features a mandolin .
From the end of World War II until 1971 , when John Rawls published A Theory of Justice , political philosophy declined in the Anglo-American academic world , as analytic philosophers expressed skepticism about the possibility that normative judgments had cognitive content , and political science turned toward statistical methods and behavioralism . In continental Europe , on the other hand , the postwar decades saw a huge blossoming of political philosophy , with Marxism dominating the field . This was the time of Jean-Paul Sartre and Louis Althusser , and the victories of Mao Zedong in China and Fidel Castro in Cuba , as well as the events of May 1968 led to increased interest in revolutionary ideology , especially by the New Left . A number of continental European émigrés to Britain and the United States—including Karl Popper , Friedrich Hayek , Leo Strauss , Isaiah Berlin , Eric Voegelin and Judith Shklar—encouraged continued study in political philosophy in the Anglo-American world , but in the 1950s and 1960s they and their students remained at odds with the analytic establishment .
On June 4 , 2014 , the NFL announced that the practice of branding Super Bowl games with Roman numerals , a practice established at Super Bowl V , would be temporarily suspended , and that the game would be named using Arabic numerals as Super Bowl 50 as opposed to Super Bowl L. The use of Roman numerals will be reinstated for Super Bowl LI . Jaime Weston , the league 's vice president of brand and creative , explained that a primary reason for the change was the difficulty of designing an aesthetically pleasing logo with the letter " L " using the standardized logo template introduced at Super Bowl XLV . The logo also deviates from the template by featuring large numerals , colored in gold , behind the Vince Lombardi Trophy , instead of underneath and in silver as in the standard logo .
Doug Morris , who was head of Warner Music Group , then Universal Music , became chairman and CEO of the company on July 1 , 2011 . Sony Music underwent a restructuring after Morris ' arrival . He was joined by L.A. Reid , who became the chairman and CEO of Epic Records . Under Reid , multiple artists from the Jive half of the former RCA/Jive Label Group moved to Epic . Peter Edge became the new CEO of the RCA Records unit . The RCA Music Group closed down Arista , J Records and Jive Records in October 2011 , with the artists from those labels being moved to RCA Records .
Due to the often political and cultural contours of blackness in the United States , the notion of blackness can also be extended to non-black people . Toni Morrison once described Bill Clinton as the first black President of the United States , because , as she put it , he displayed " almost every trope of blackness " . Christopher Hitchens was offended by the notion of Clinton as the first black president , noting , " Mr Clinton , according to Toni Morrison , the Nobel Prize-winning novelist , is our first black President , the first to come from the broken home , the alcoholic mother , the under-the-bridge shadows of our ranking systems . Thus , we may have lost the mystical power to divine diabolism , but we can still divine blackness by the following symptoms : broken homes , alcoholic mothers , under-the-bridge habits and ( presumable from the rest of [ Arthur ] Miller 's senescent musings ) the tendency to sexual predation and to shameless perjury about same . " Some black activists were also offended , claiming that Clinton used his knowledge of black culture to exploit black people for political gain as no other president had before , while not serving black interests . They cite the lack of action during the Rwandan Genocide and his welfare reform , which Larry Roberts said had led to the worst child poverty since the 1960s . Others cited that the number of black people in jail increased during his administration .
Book 7 ( beginning the Iliadic half ) opens with an address to the muse and recounts Aeneas ' arrival in Italy and betrothal to Lavinia , daughter of King Latinus . Lavinia had already been promised to Turnus , the king of the Rutulians , who is roused to war by the Fury Allecto , and Amata Lavinia 's mother . In Book 8 , Aeneas allies with King Evander , who occupies the future site of Rome , and is given new armor and a shield depicting Roman history . Book 9 records an assault by Nisus and Euryalus on the Rutulians , Book 10 , the death of Evander 's young son Pallas , and 11 the death of the Volscian warrior princess Camilla and the decision to settle the war with a duel between Aeneas and Turnus . The Aeneid ends in Book 12 with the taking of Latinus ' city , the death of Amata , and Aeneas ' defeat and killing of Turnus , whose pleas for mercy are spurned . The final book ends with the image of Turnus ' soul lamenting as it flees to the underworld .
On 19 October 1512 , he was awarded his Doctor of Theology and , on 21 October 1512 , was received into the senate of the theological faculty of the University of Wittenberg , having been called to the position of Doctor in Bible . He spent the rest of his career in this position at the University of Wittenberg .
This nationwide acceptance and recognition of Aboriginal people led to a significant increase in the number of people self-identifying as Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander . The reappropriation of the term " black " with a positive and more inclusive meaning has resulted in its widespread use in mainstream Australian culture , including public media outlets , government agencies , and private companies . In 2012 , a number of high-profile cases highlighted the legal and community attitude that identifying as Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander is not dependent on skin colour , with a well-known boxer Anthony Mundine being widely criticised for questioning the " blackness " of another boxer and journalist Andrew Bolt being successfully sued for publishing discriminatory comments about Aboriginals with light skin .
Many people gain a sense of positive self-esteem from their identity groups , which furthers a sense of community and belonging . Another issue that researchers have attempted to address is the question of why people engage in discrimination , i.e. , why they tend to favor those they consider a part of their " in-group " over those considered to be outsiders . Both questions have been given extensive attention by researchers working in the social identity tradition . For example , in work relating to social identity theory it has been shown that merely crafting cognitive distinction between in- and out-groups can lead to subtle effects on people 's evaluations of others ( Cote & Levine 2002 ) .
To avoid confusing or upsetting the people , Luther avoided extreme change . He also did not wish to replace one controlling system with another . He concentrated on the church in the Electorate of Saxony , acting only as an adviser to churches in new territories , many of which followed his Saxon model . He worked closely with the new elector , John the Steadfast , to whom he turned for secular leadership and funds on behalf of a church largely shorn of its assets and income after the break with Rome . For Luther 's biographer Martin Brecht , this partnership " was the beginning of a questionable and originally unintended development towards a church government under the temporal sovereign " . The elector authorised a visitation of the church , a power formerly exercised by bishops . At times , Luther 's practical reforms fell short of his earlier radical pronouncements . For example , the Instructions for the Visitors of Parish Pastors in Electoral Saxony ( 1528 ) , drafted by Melanchthon with Luther 's approval , stressed the role of repentance in the forgiveness of sins , despite Luther 's position that faith alone ensures justification . The Eisleben reformer Johannes Agricola challenged this compromise , and Luther condemned him for teaching that faith is separate from works . The Instruction is a problematic document for those seeking a consistent evolution in Luther 's thought and practice .
Luther 's hymns were frequently evoked by particular events in his life and the unfolding Reformation . This behavior started with his learning of the execution of Johann Esch and Heinrich Voes , the first individuals to be martyred by the Roman Catholic Church for Lutheran views , prompting Luther to write the hymn " Ein neues Lied wir heben an " ( " A new song we raise " ) , which is generally known in English by John C. Messenger 's translation by the title and first line " Flung to the Heedless Winds " and sung to the tune Ibstone composed in 1875 by Maria C. Tiddeman .
For the first time , the Super Bowl 50 Host Committee and the NFL have openly sought disabled veteran and lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender-owned businesses in Business Connect , the Super Bowl program that provides local companies with contracting opportunities in and around the Super Bowl . The host committee has already raised over $ 40 million through sponsors including Apple , Google , Yahoo ! , Intel , Gap , Chevron , and Dignity Health .
The Broncos ' defense ranked first in the NFL yards allowed ( 4,530 ) for the first time in franchise history , and fourth in points allowed ( 296 ) . Defensive ends Derek Wolfe and Malik Jackson each had 5½ sacks . Pro Bowl linebacker Von Miller led the team with 11 sacks , forced four fumbles , and recovered three . Linebacker DeMarcus Ware was selected to play in the Pro Bowl for the ninth time in his career , ranking second on the team with 7½ sacks . Linebacker Brandon Marshall led the team in total tackles with 109 , while Danny Trevathan ranked second with 102 . Cornerbacks Aqib Talib ( three interceptions ) and Chris Harris , Jr. ( two interceptions ) were the other two Pro Bowl selections from the defense .
By 1987 , CBS was the only " big three " American TV network to have a co-owned record company . ABC had sold its record division to MCA Records in 1979 , and in 1986 , NBC 's parent company RCA was sold to General Electric , who then sold off all other RCA units , including the record division ( which was bought by Ariola Records , later known as BMG ) .
In 2008 [ update ] the total number of full-time equivalent jobs was 125,037 . The number of jobs in the primary sector was 203 , of which 184 were in agriculture and 19 were in forestry or lumber production . The number of jobs in the secondary sector was 15,476 of which 7,650 or ( 49.4 % ) were in manufacturing , 51 or ( 0.3 % ) were in mining and 6,389 ( 41.3 % ) were in construction .

Zinc is a chemical element with symbol Zn and atomic number 30 . It is the first element of group 12 of the periodic table . In some respects zinc is chemically similar to magnesium : its ion is of similar size and its only common oxidation state is +2 . Zinc is the 24th most abundant element in Earth 's crust and has five stable isotopes . The most common zinc ore is sphalerite ( zinc blende ) , a zinc sulfide mineral . The largest mineable amounts are found in Australia , Asia , and the United States . Zinc production includes froth flotation of the ore , roasting , and final extraction using electricity ( electrowinning ) .
Some Western writers claim that the immaculate conception of Mary is a teaching of Islam . Thus , commenting in 1734 on the passage in the Qur'an , " I have called her Mary ; and I commend her to thy protection , and also her issue , against Satan driven away with stones " , George Sale stated : " It is not improbable that the pretended immaculate conception of the virgin Mary is intimated in this passage . For according to a tradition of Mohammed , every person that comes into the world , is touched at his birth by the devil , and therefore cries out , Mary and her son only excepted ; between whom , and the evil spirit God placed a veil , so that his touch did not reach them . And for this reason they say , neither of them were guilty of any sin , like the rest of the children of Adam . "
Columbia founded Epic Records in 1953 . In 1956 , Conkling left Columbia , he would help establish the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences before eventually becoming the first president of the newly launched Warner Bros. Records , and Goddard Lieberson began the first of two stints as head of the record company . In 1958 , Columbia founded another label , Date Records , which initially issued rockabilly music .
On Carolina 's next possession fullback Mike Tolbert lost a fumble while being tackled by safety Darian Stewart , which linebacker Danny Trevathan recovered on the Broncos 40-yard line . However , the Panthers soon took the ball back when defensive end Kony Ealy tipped a Manning pass to himself and then intercepted it , returning the ball 19 yards to the Panthers 39-yard line with 1:55 left on the clock . The Panthers could not gain any yards with their possession and had to punt . After a Denver punt , Carolina drove to the Broncos 45-yard line . But with 11 seconds left , Newton was sacked by DeMarcus Ware as time expired in the half .
The first favours a primordialist approach which takes the sense of self and belonging to a collective group as a fixed thing , defined by objective criteria such as common ancestry and common biological characteristics . The second , rooted in social constructionist theory , takes the view that identity is formed by a predominantly political choice of certain characteristics . In so doing , it questions the idea that identity is a natural given , characterised by fixed , supposedly objective criteria . Both approaches need to be understood in their respective political and historical contexts , characterised by debate on issues of class , race and ethnicity . While they have been criticized , they continue to exert an influence on approaches to the conceptualisation of identity today .
In the late 1960s , the term heavy metal was used interchangeably with hard rock , but gradually began to be used to describe music played with even more volume and intensity . While hard rock maintained a bluesy rock and roll identity , including some swing in the back beat and riffs that tended to outline chord progressions in their hooks , heavy metal 's riffs often functioned as stand-alone melodies and had no swing in them . Heavy metal took on " darker " characteristics after Black Sabbath 's breakthrough at the beginning of the 1970s . In the 1980s it developed a number of subgenres , often termed extreme metal , some of which were influenced by hardcore punk , and which further differentiated the two styles . Despite this differentiation , hard rock and heavy metal have existed side by side , with bands frequently standing on the boundary of , or crossing between , the genres .
But Amnesty International found no evidence that UNFPA had supported the coercion . A 2001 study conducted by the pro-life Population Research Institute ( PRI ) falsely claimed that the UNFPA shared an office with the Chinese family planning officials who were carrying out forced abortions . " We located the family planning offices , and in that family planning office , we located the UNFPA office , and we confirmed from family planning officials there that there is no distinction between what the UNFPA does and what the Chinese Family Planning Office does , " said Scott Weinberg , a spokesman for PRI . However , United Nations Members disagreed and approved UNFPA ’ s new country program me in January 2006 . The more than 130 members of the “ Group of 77 ” developing countries in the United Nations expressed support for the UNFPA programmes . In addition , speaking for European democracies -- Norway , Denmark , Sweden , Finland , the Netherlands , France , Belgium , Switzerland and Germany -- the United Kingdom stated , ” UNFPA ’ s activities in China , as in the rest of the world , are in strict conformity with the unanimously adopted Programme of Action of the ICPD , and play a key role in supporting our common endeavor , the promotion and protection of all human rights and fundamental freedoms . ”
Luther 's 1541 hymn " Christ unser Herr zum Jordan kam " ( " To Jordan came the Christ our Lord " ) reflects the structure and substance of his questions and answers concerning baptism in the Small Catechism . Luther adopted a preexisting Johann Walter tune associated with a hymnic setting of Psalm 67 's prayer for grace ; Wolf Heintz 's four-part setting of the hymn was used to introduce the Lutheran Reformation in Halle in 1541 . Preachers and composers of the 18th century , including J. S. Bach , used this rich hymn as a subject for their own work , although its objective baptismal theology was displaced by more subjective hymns under the influence of late-19th-century Lutheran pietism .
Medieval political philosophy in Europe was heavily influenced by Christian thinking . It had much in common with the Mutazalite Islamic thinking in that the Roman Catholics though subordinating philosophy to theology did not subject reason to revelation but in the case of contradictions , subordinated reason to faith as the Asharite of Islam . The Scholastics by combining the philosophy of Aristotle with the Christianity of St. Augustine emphasized the potential harmony inherent in reason and revelation . Perhaps the most influential political philosopher of medieval Europe was St. Thomas Aquinas who helped reintroduce Aristotle 's works , which had only been transmitted to Catholic Europe through Muslim Spain , along with the commentaries of Averroes . Aquinas 's use of them set the agenda , for scholastic political philosophy dominated European thought for centuries even unto the Renaissance .
Beginning with the Paris Exposition of 1878 , the instrument 's popularity rebounded . The Exposition was one of many stops for a popular new performing group the Estudiantes Españoles ( Spanish Students ) . They danced and played guitars , violins and the bandurria , which became confused with the mandolin . Along with the energy and awareness created by the day 's hit sensation , a wave of Italian mandolinists travelled Europe in the 1880s and 1890s and in the United States by the mid-1880s , playing and teaching their instrument . The instrument 's popularity continued to increase during the 1890s and mandolin popularity was at its height in " early years of the 20th century . " Thousands were taking up the instrument as a pastime , and it became an instrument of society , taken up by young men and women . Mandolin orchestras were formed worldwide , incorporating not only the mandolin family of instruments , but also guitars , double basses and zithers .
By about 6000 BC , a Neolithic culture rooted in the Nile Valley . During the Neolithic era , several predynastic cultures developed independently in Upper and Lower Egypt . The Badarian culture and the successor Naqada series are generally regarded as precursors to dynastic Egypt . The earliest known Lower Egyptian site , Merimda , predates the Badarian by about seven hundred years . Contemporaneous Lower Egyptian communities coexisted with their southern counterparts for more than two thousand years , remaining culturally distinct , but maintaining frequent contact through trade . The earliest known evidence of Egyptian hieroglyphic inscriptions appeared during the predynastic period on Naqada III pottery vessels , dated to about 3200 BC .

There is evidence of induced copper deficiency in those taking 100–300 mg of zinc daily . A 2007 trial observed that elderly men taking 80 mg daily were hospitalized for urinary complications more often than those taking a placebo . The USDA RDA is 11 and 8 mg Zn/day for men and women , respectively . Levels of 100–300 mg may interfere with the utilization of copper and iron or adversely affect cholesterol . Levels of zinc in excess of 500 ppm in soil interfere with the ability of plants to absorb other essential metals , such as iron and manganese . There is also a condition called the zinc shakes or " zinc chills " that can be induced by the inhalation of freshly formed zinc oxide formed during the welding of galvanized materials . Zinc is a common ingredient of denture cream which may contain between 17 and 38 mg of zinc per gram . There have been claims of disability , and even death , due to excessive use of these products .
In 2008 , the High Court in South Africa ruled that Chinese South Africans who were residents during the apartheid era ( and their descendants ) are to be reclassified as " Black people , " solely for the purposes of accessing affirmative action benefits , because they were also " disadvantaged " by racial discrimination . Chinese people who arrived in the country after the end of apartheid do not qualify for such benefits .
There would be no more scoring in the third quarter , but early in the fourth , the Broncos drove to the Panthers 41-yard line . On the next play , Ealy knocked the ball out of Manning 's hand as he was winding up for a pass , and then recovered it for Carolina on the 50-yard line . A 16-yard reception by Devin Funchess and a 12-yard run by Stewart then set up Gano 's 39-yard field goal , cutting the Panthers deficit to one score at 16–10 . The next three drives of the game would end in punts .
Mandolin awareness in the United States blossomed in the 1880s , as the instrument became part of a fad that continued into the mid-1920s . According to Clarence L. Partee , the first mandolin made in the United States was made in 1883 or 1884 by Joseph Bohmann , who was an established maker of violins in Chicago . Partee characterized the early instrument as being larger than the European instruments he was used to , with a " peculiar shape " and " crude construction , " and said that the quality improved , until American instruments were " superior " to imported instruments . At the time , Partee was using an imported French-made mandolin .

Egypt has one of the longest histories of any modern country , arising in the tenth millennium BC as one of the world 's first nation states . Considered a cradle of civilisation , Ancient Egypt experienced some of the earliest developments of writing , agriculture , urbanisation , organised religion and central government . Iconic monuments such as the Giza Necropolis and its Great Sphinx , as well the ruins of Memphis , Thebes , Karnak , and the Valley of the Kings , reflect this legacy and remain a significant focus of archaeological study and popular interest worldwide . Egypt 's rich cultural heritage is an integral part of its national identity , having endured , and at times assimilated , various foreign influences , including Greek , Persian , Roman , Arab , Ottoman , and European . Although Christianised in the first century of the Common Era , it was subsequently Islamised due to the Islamic conquests of the seventh century .
The catechism is one of Luther 's most personal works . " Regarding the plan to collect my writings in volumes , " he wrote , " I am quite cool and not at all eager about it because , roused by a Saturnian hunger , I would rather see them all devoured . For I acknowledge none of them to be really a book of mine , except perhaps the Bondage of the Will and the Catechism . " The Small Catechism has earned a reputation as a model of clear religious teaching . It remains in use today , along with Luther 's hymns and his translation of the Bible .
Luther taught that salvation and subsequently eternal life is not earned by good deeds but is received only as a free gift of God 's grace through faith in Jesus Christ as redeemer from sin . His theology challenged the authority and office of the Pope by teaching that the Bible is the only source of divinely revealed knowledge from God and opposed sacerdotalism by considering all baptized Christians to be a holy priesthood . Those who identify with these , and all of Luther 's wider teachings , are called Lutherans even though Luther insisted on Christian or Evangelical as the only acceptable names for individuals who professed Christ .

Since the 16th century , the city has had a bear pit , the Bärengraben , at the far end of the Nydeggbrücke to house its heraldic animals . The currently four bears are now kept in an open-air enclosure nearby , and two other young bears , a present by the Russian president , are kept in Dählhölzli zoo .
Brass , which is an alloy of copper and zinc , has been used since at least the 10th century BC in Judea and by the 7th century BC in Ancient Greece . Zinc metal was not produced on a large scale until the 12th century in India and was unknown to Europe until the end of the 16th century . The mines of Rajasthan have given definite evidence of zinc production going back to the 6th century BC . To date , the oldest evidence of pure zinc comes from Zawar , in Rajasthan , as early as the 9th century AD when a distillation process was employed to make pure zinc . Alchemists burned zinc in air to form what they called " philosopher 's wool " or " white snow " .
There would be no more scoring in the third quarter , but early in the fourth , the Broncos drove to the Panthers 41-yard line . On the next play , Ealy knocked the ball out of Manning 's hand as he was winding up for a pass , and then recovered it for Carolina on the 50-yard line . A 16-yard reception by Devin Funchess and a 12-yard run by Stewart then set up Gano 's 39-yard field goal , cutting the Panthers deficit to one score at 16–10 . The next three drives of the game would end in punts .
From outside the United Kingdom and the United States , the Canadian trio Rush released three distinctively hard rock albums in 1974–75 ( Rush , Fly by Night and Caress of Steel ) before moving toward a more progressive sound with the 1976 album 2112 . The Irish band Thin Lizzy , which had formed in the late 1960s , made their most substantial commercial breakthrough in 1976 with the hard rock album Jailbreak and their worldwide hit " The Boys Are Back in Town " , which reached number 8 in the UK and number 12 in the US . Their style , consisting of two duelling guitarists often playing leads in harmony , proved itself to be a large influence on later bands . They reached their commercial , and arguably their artistic peak with Black Rose : A Rock Legend ( 1979 ) . The arrival of Scorpions from Germany marked the geographical expansion of the subgenre . Australian-formed AC/DC , with a stripped back , riff heavy and abrasive style that also appealed to the punk generation , began to gain international attention from 1976 , culminating in the release of their multi-platinum albums Let There Be Rock ( 1977 ) and Highway to Hell ( 1979 ) . Also influenced by a punk ethos were heavy metal bands like Motörhead , while Judas Priest abandoned the remaining elements of the blues in their music , further differentiating the hard rock and heavy metal styles and helping to create the New Wave of British Heavy Metal which was pursued by bands like Iron Maiden , Saxon and Venom .
Six-time Grammy winner and Academy Award nominee Lady Gaga performed the national anthem , while Academy Award winner Marlee Matlin provided American Sign Language ( ASL ) translation .

On June 4 , 2014 , the NFL announced that the practice of branding Super Bowl games with Roman numerals , a practice established at Super Bowl V , would be temporarily suspended , and that the game would be named using Arabic numerals as Super Bowl 50 as opposed to Super Bowl L. The use of Roman numerals will be reinstated for Super Bowl LI . Jaime Weston , the league 's vice president of brand and creative , explained that a primary reason for the change was the difficulty of designing an aesthetically pleasing logo with the letter " L " using the standardized logo template introduced at Super Bowl XLV . The logo also deviates from the template by featuring large numerals , colored in gold , behind the Vince Lombardi Trophy , instead of underneath and in silver as in the standard logo .
On Carolina 's next possession fullback Mike Tolbert lost a fumble while being tackled by safety Darian Stewart , which linebacker Danny Trevathan recovered on the Broncos 40-yard line . However , the Panthers soon took the ball back when defensive end Kony Ealy tipped a Manning pass to himself and then intercepted it , returning the ball 19 yards to the Panthers 39-yard line with 1:55 left on the clock . The Panthers could not gain any yards with their possession and had to punt . After a Denver punt , Carolina drove to the Broncos 45-yard line . But with 11 seconds left , Newton was sacked by DeMarcus Ware as time expired in the half .
Martin Luther married Katharina von Bora , one of 12 nuns he had helped escape from the Nimbschen Cistercian convent in April 1523 , when he arranged for them to be smuggled out in herring barrels . " Suddenly , and while I was occupied with far different thoughts , " he wrote to Wenceslaus Link , " the Lord has plunged me into marriage . " At the time of their marriage , Katharina was 26 years old and Luther was 41 years old .
The United Nations Population Fund ( UNFPA ) , formerly the United Nations Fund for Population Activities , is a UN organization . The UNFPA says it " is the lead UN agency for delivering a world where every pregnancy is wanted , every childbirth is safe and every young person 's potential is fulfilled . " Their work involves the improvement of reproductive health ; including creation of national strategies and protocols , and providing supplies and services . The organization has recently been known for its worldwide campaign against obstetric fistula and female genital mutilation .
Book 1 ( at the head of the Odyssean section ) opens with a storm which Juno , Aeneas ' enemy throughout the poem , stirs up against the fleet . The storm drives the hero to the coast of Carthage , which historically was Rome 's deadliest foe . The queen , Dido , welcomes the ancestor of the Romans , and under the influence of the gods falls deeply in love with him . At a banquet in Book 2 , Aeneas tells the story of the sack of Troy , the death of his wife , and his escape , to the enthralled Carthaginians , while in Book 3 he recounts to them his wanderings over the Mediterranean in search of a suitable new home . Jupiter in Book 4 recalls the lingering Aeneas to his duty to found a new city , and he slips away from Carthage , leaving Dido to commit suicide , cursing Aeneas and calling down revenge in a symbolic anticipation of the fierce wars between Carthage and Rome . In Book 5 , Aeneas ' father Anchises dies and funeral games are celebrated for him . On reaching Cumae , in Italy in Book 6 , Aeneas consults the Cumaean Sibyl , who conducts him through the Underworld where Aeneas meets the dead Anchises who reveals Rome 's destiny to his son .
On November 17 , 1987 , SCA acquired CBS Records , which hosted such acts as Michael Jackson , for US $ 2 billion . CBS Inc. , now CBS Corporation , retained the rights to the CBS name for music recordings but granted Sony a temporary license to use the CBS name . CBS Corporation founded a new CBS Records in 2006 , which is distributed by Sony through its RED subsidiary .
To symbolize their bond with the papacy , the pope gives each newly appointed cardinal a gold ring , which is traditionally kissed by Catholics when greeting a cardinal ( as with a bishop 's episcopal ring ) . The pope chooses the image on the outside : under Pope Benedict XVI it was a modern depiction of the crucifixion of Jesus , with Mary and John to each side . The ring includes the pope 's coat of arms on the inside . [ citation needed ]
Cardinals have in canon law a " privilege of forum " ( i.e. , exemption from being judged by ecclesiastical tribunals of ordinary rank ) : only the pope is competent to judge them in matters subject to ecclesiastical jurisdiction ( cases that refer to matters that are spiritual or linked with the spiritual , or with regard to infringement of ecclesiastical laws and whatever contains an element of sin , where culpability must be determined and the appropriate ecclesiastical penalty imposed ) . The pope either decides the case himself or delegates the decision to a tribunal , usually one of the tribunals or congregations of the Roman Curia . Without such delegation , no ecclesiastical court , even the Roman Rota , is competent to judge a canon law case against a cardinal . Cardinals are , however , subject to the civil and criminal law like everybody else .
The last ruler from the Ptolemaic line was Cleopatra VII , who committed suicide following the burial of her lover Mark Antony who had died in her arms ( from a self-inflicted stab wound ) , after Octavian had captured Alexandria and her mercenary forces had fled . The Ptolemies faced rebellions of native Egyptians often caused by an unwanted regime and were involved in foreign and civil wars that led to the decline of the kingdom and its annexation by Rome . Nevertheless , Hellenistic culture continued to thrive in Egypt well after the Muslim conquest .
Scholars disagree over the effects of social status on racial classifications in Brazil . It is generally believed that achieving upward mobility and education results in individuals being classified as a category of lighter skin . The popular claim is that in Brazil , poor whites are considered black and wealthy blacks are considered white . Some scholars disagree , arguing that " whitening " of one 's social status may be open to people of mixed race , a large part of the population known as pardo , but a person perceived as preto ( black ) will continue to be classified as black regardless of wealth or social status .
With the rise of disco in the US and punk rock in the UK , hard rock 's mainstream dominance was rivalled toward the later part of the decade . Disco appealed to a more diverse group of people and punk seemed to take over the rebellious role that hard rock once held . Early punk bands like The Ramones explicitly rebelled against the drum solos and extended guitar solos that characterised stadium rock , with almost all of their songs clocking in around two minutes with no guitar solos . However , new rock acts continued to emerge and record sales remained high into the 1980s . 1977 saw the début and rise to stardom of Foreigner , who went on to release several platinum albums through to the mid-1980s . Midwestern groups like Kansas , REO Speedwagon and Styx helped further cement heavy rock in the Midwest as a form of stadium rock . In 1978 , Van Halen emerged from the Los Angeles music scene with a sound based around the skills of lead guitarist Eddie Van Halen . He popularised a guitar-playing technique of two-handed hammer-ons and pull-offs called tapping , showcased on the song " Eruption " from the album Van Halen , which was highly influential in re-establishing hard rock as a popular genre after the punk and disco explosion , while also redefining and elevating the role of electric guitar .
The Panthers beat the Seattle Seahawks in the divisional round , running up a 31–0 halftime lead and then holding off a furious second half comeback attempt to win 31–24 , avenging their elimination from a year earlier . The Panthers then blew out the Arizona Cardinals in the NFC Championship Game , 49–15 , racking up 487 yards and forcing seven turnovers .
On 28 February 1476 , Pope Sixtus IV , authorized those dioceses that wished to introduce the feast to do so , and introduced it to his own diocese of Rome in 1477 , with a specially composed Mass and Office of the feast . With his bull Cum praeexcelsa of 28 February 1477 , in which he referred to the feast as that of the Conception of Mary , without using the word " Immaculate " , he granted indulgences to those who would participate in the specially composed Mass or Office on the feast itself or during its octave , and he used the word " immaculate " of Mary , but applied instead the adjective " miraculous " to her conception . On 4 September 1483 , referring to the feast as that of " the Conception of Immaculate Mary ever Virgin " , he condemned both those who called it mortally sinful and heretical to hold that the " glorious and immaculate mother of God was conceived without the stain of original sin " and those who called it mortally sinful and heretical to hold that " the glorious Virgin Mary was conceived with original sin " , since , he said , " up to this time there has been no decision made by the Roman Church and the Apostolic See . " This decree was reaffirmed by the Council of Trent .
By the end of the decade a distinct genre of hard rock was emerging with bands like Led Zeppelin , who mixed the music of early rock bands with a more hard-edged form of blues rock and acid rock on their first two albums Led Zeppelin ( 1969 ) and Led Zeppelin II ( 1969 ) , and Deep Purple , who began as a progressive rock group but achieved their commercial breakthrough with their fourth and distinctively heavier album , In Rock ( 1970 ) . Also significant was Black Sabbath 's Paranoid ( 1970 ) , which combined guitar riffs with dissonance and more explicit references to the occult and elements of Gothic horror . All three of these bands have been seen as pivotal in the development of heavy metal , but where metal further accentuated the intensity of the music , with bands like Judas Priest following Sabbath 's lead into territory that was often " darker and more menacing " , hard rock tended to continue to remain the more exuberant , good-time music .
The Panthers defense gave up just 308 points , ranking sixth in the league , while also leading the NFL in interceptions with 24 and boasting four Pro Bowl selections . Pro Bowl defensive tackle Kawann Short led the team in sacks with 11 , while also forcing three fumbles and recovering two . Fellow lineman Mario Addison added 6½ sacks . The Panthers line also featured veteran defensive end Jared Allen , a 5-time pro bowler who was the NFL 's active career sack leader with 136 , along with defensive end Kony Ealy , who had 5 sacks in just 9 starts . Behind them , two of the Panthers three starting linebackers were also selected to play in the Pro Bowl : Thomas Davis and Luke Kuechly . Davis compiled 5½ sacks , four forced fumbles , and four interceptions , while Kuechly led the team in tackles ( 118 ) forced two fumbles , and intercepted four passes of his own . Carolina 's secondary featured Pro Bowl safety Kurt Coleman , who led the team with a career high seven interceptions , while also racking up 88 tackles and Pro Bowl cornerback Josh Norman , who developed into a shutdown corner during the season and had four interceptions , two of which were returned for touchdowns .
In response , the EU decided to fill the gap left behind by the US under the Sandbaek report . According to its Annual Report for 2008 , the UNFPA received its funding mainly from European Governments : Of the total income of M845.3 M , $ 118 was donated by the Netherlands , $ 67 M by Sweden , $ 62 M by Norway , $ 54 M by Denmark , $ 53 M by the UK , $ 52 M by Spain , $ 19 M by Luxembourg . The European Commission donated further $ 36 M. The most important non-European donor State was Japan ( $ 36 M ) . The number of donors exceeded 180 in one year .

Egyptian literature traces its beginnings to ancient Egypt and is some of the earliest known literature . Indeed , the Egyptians were the first culture to develop literature as we know it today , that is , the book . It is an important cultural element in the life of Egypt . Egyptian novelists and poets were among the first to experiment with modern styles of Arabic literature , and the forms they developed have been widely imitated throughout the Middle East . The first modern Egyptian novel Zaynab by Muhammad Husayn Haykal was published in 1913 in the Egyptian vernacular . Egyptian novelist Naguib Mahfouz was the first Arabic-language writer to win the Nobel Prize in Literature . Egyptian women writers include Nawal El Saadawi , well known for her feminist activism , and Alifa Rifaat who also writes about women and tradition .
In the 1530s and 1540s , printed images of Luther that emphasized his monumental size were crucial to the spread of Protestantism . In contrast to images of frail Catholic saints , Luther was presented as a stout man with a " double chin , strong mouth , piercing deep-set eyes , fleshy face , and squat neck . " He was shown to be physically imposing , an equal in stature to the secular German princes with whom he would join forces to spread Lutheranism . His large body also let the viewer know that he did not shun earthly pleasures like drinking—behavior that was a stark contrast to the ascetic life of the medieval religious orders . Famous images from this period include the woodcuts by Hans Brosamer ( 1530 ) and Lucas Cranach the Elder and Lucas Cranach the Younger ( 1546 ) .

No archaeological evidence that indicates a settlement on the site of today′s city centre prior to the 12th century has been found so far . In antiquity , a Celtic oppidum stood on the Engehalbinsel ( peninsula ) north of Bern , fortified since the 2nd century BC ( late La Tène period ) , thought to be one of the twelve oppida of the Helvetii mentioned by Caesar . During the Roman era , there was a Gallo-Roman vicus on the same site . The Bern zinc tablet has the name Brenodor ( " dwelling of Breno " ) . In the Early Middle Ages , there was a settlement in Bümpliz , now a city district of Bern , some 4 km ( 2 mi ) from the medieval city .
In 1523 , Luther wrote that Jesus Christ was born a Jew which discouraged mistreatment of the Jews and advocated their conversion by proving that the Old Testament could be shown to speak of Jesus Christ . However , as the Reformation continued , Luther began to lose hope in large-scale Jewish conversion to Christianity . In his later years , Luther grew more hostile toward the Jews , writing against them with the kind of venom he had already unleashed on the Anabaptists , Zwinglianism , and the papacy . His 1543 treatise Von den Juden und ihren Lügen ( On the Jews and Their Lies ) took its place among other anti-Jewish literature of the times , although historians acknowledge that this treatise was particularly extreme , even by the standards of sixteenth century Europe . In it , he takes a hardline against Judaism , writing that synagogues and Jewish homes should be destroyed , their money confiscated , and liberty curtailed . These statements and their influence on antisemitism have contributed to his controversial status .

The municipality had 266 primary classes and 5,040 pupils . Of the primary pupils , 30.1 % were permanent or temporary residents of Switzerland ( not citizens ) and 35.7 % have a different mother language than the classroom language . During the same year , there were 151 lower secondary classes with a total of 2,581 pupils . There were 28.7 % who were permanent or temporary residents of Switzerland ( not citizens ) and 32.7 % have a different mother language than the classroom language .
With Rivera having been a linebacker with the Chicago Bears in Super Bowl XX , and Kubiak replacing Elway at the end of the Broncos ' defeats in Super Bowls XXI and XXIV , this will be the first Super Bowl in which both head coaches played in the game themselves .
At the heart of scholars ' debate about Luther 's influence is whether it is anachronistic to view his work as a precursor of the racial antisemitism of the Nazis . Some scholars see Luther 's influence as limited , and the Nazis ' use of his work as opportunistic . Biographer Martin Brecht points out that " There is a world of difference between his belief in salvation and a racial ideology . Nevertheless , his misguided agitation had the evil result that Luther fatefully became one of the 'church fathers ' of anti-Semitism and thus provided material for the modern hatred of the Jews , cloaking it with the authority of the Reformer . " Johannes Wallmann argues that Luther 's writings against the Jews were largely ignored in the 18th and 19th centuries , and that there was no continuity between Luther 's thought and Nazi ideology . Uwe Siemon-Netto agreed , arguing that it was because the Nazis were already anti-Semites that they revived Luther 's work . Hans J. Hillerbrand agreed that to focus on Luther was to adopt an essentially ahistorical perspective of Nazi antisemitism that ignored other contributory factors in German history . Similarly , Roland Bainton , noted church historian and Luther biographer , wrote " One could wish that Luther had died before ever [ On the Jews and Their Lies ] was written . His position was entirely religious and in no respect racial . "

In January 2009 President Barack Obama restored US funding to UNFPA , saying in a public statement that he would " look forward to working with Congress to restore US financial support for the UN Population Fund . By resuming funding to UNFPA , the US will be joining 180 other donor nations working collaboratively to reduce poverty , improve the health of women and children , prevent HIV/AIDS and provide family planning assistance to women in 154 countries . "
Indigenous Australians have been referred to as " black people " in Australia since the early days of European settlement . While originally related to skin colour , the term is used to today to indicate Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander ancestry in general and can refer to people of any skin pigmentation .
On 19 October 1512 , he was awarded his Doctor of Theology and , on 21 October 1512 , was received into the senate of the theological faculty of the University of Wittenberg , having been called to the position of Doctor in Bible . He spent the rest of his career in this position at the University of Wittenberg .
The apartheid bureaucracy devised complex ( and often arbitrary ) criteria in the Population Registration Act of 1945 to determine who belonged in which group . Minor officials administered tests to enforce the classifications . When it was unclear from a person 's physical appearance whether the individual should be considered Coloured or Black , the " pencil test " was used . A pencil was inserted into a person 's hair to determine if the hair was kinky enough to hold the pencil , rather than having it pass through , as it would with smoother hair . If so , the person was classified as Black . Such classifications sometimes divided families .
Archbishop Albrecht of Mainz and Magdeburg did not reply to Luther 's letter containing the 95 Theses . He had the theses checked for heresy and in December 1517 forwarded them to Rome . He needed the revenue from the indulgences to pay off a papal dispensation for his tenure of more than one bishopric . As Luther later noted , " the pope had a finger in the pie as well , because one half was to go to the building of St Peter 's Church in Rome " .
In this work , one of his most emphatic statements on faith , he argued that every good work designed to attract God 's favor is a sin . All humans are sinners by nature , he explained , and God 's grace ( which can not be earned ) alone can make them just . On 1 August 1521 , Luther wrote to Melanchthon on the same theme : " Be a sinner , and let your sins be strong , but let your trust in Christ be stronger , and rejoice in Christ who is the victor over sin , death , and the world . We will commit sins while we are here , for this life is not a place where justice resides . "
Some succeeded their fathers as rulers , such as Sultan Ahmad al-Mansur , who ruled Morocco from 1578 to 1608 . He was not technically considered as a mixed-race child of a slave ; his mother was Fulani and a concubine of his father . Such tolerance for black persons , even when technically " free " , was not so common in Morocco . The long association of sub-Saharan peoples as slaves is shown in the term abd ( Arabic : عبد‎ , ) ( meaning " slave " ) ; it is still frequently used in the Arabic-speaking world as a term for black people .
Some priests and former religious had already married , including Andreas Karlstadt and Justus Jonas , but Luther 's wedding set the seal of approval on clerical marriage . He had long condemned vows of celibacy on Biblical grounds , but his decision to marry surprised many , not least Melanchthon , who called it reckless . Luther had written to George Spalatin on 30 November 1524 , " I shall never take a wife , as I feel at present . Not that I am insensible to my flesh or sex ( for I am neither wood nor stone ) ; but my mind is averse to wedlock because I daily expect the death of a heretic . " Before marrying , Luther had been living on the plainest food , and , as he admitted himself , his mildewed bed was not properly made for months at a time .
Denver took the opening kickoff and started out strong with Peyton Manning completing an 18-yard pass to tight end Owen Daniels and a 22-yard throw to receiver Andre Caldwell . A pair of carries by C. J. Anderson moved the ball up 20 yards to the Panthers 14-yard line , but Carolina 's defense dug in over the next three plays . First , linebacker Shaq Thompson tackled Ronnie Hillman for a 3-yard loss . Then after an incompletion , Thomas Davis tackled Anderson for a 1-yard gain on third down , forcing Denver to settle for a 3–0 lead on a Brandon McManus 34-yard field goal . The score marked the first time in the entire postseason that Carolina was facing a deficit .

Albert Einstein lived in a flat at the Kramgasse 49 , the site of the Einsteinhaus , from 1903 to 1905 , the year in which the Annus Mirabilis Papers were published .
On 8 February 2007 , BSkyB announced its intention to replace its three free-to-air digital terrestrial channels with four subscription channels . It was proposed that these channels would offer a range of content from the BSkyB portfolio including sport ( including English Premier League Football ) , films , entertainment and news . The announcement came a day after Setanta Sports confirmed that it would launch in March as a subscription service on the digital terrestrial platform , and on the same day that NTL 's services re-branded as Virgin Media . However , industry sources believe BSkyB will be forced to shelve plans to withdraw its channels from Freeview and replace them with subscription channels , due to possible lost advertising revenue .
The term " Moors " has been used in Europe in a broader , somewhat derogatory sense to refer to Muslims , especially those of Arab or Berber descent , whether living in North Africa or Iberia . Moors were not a distinct or self-defined people . Medieval and early modern Europeans applied the name to Muslim Arabs , Berbers , Black Africans and Europeans alike .
In the new commercial climate glam metal bands like Europe , Ratt , White Lion and Cinderella broke up , Whitesnake went on hiatus in 1991 , and while many of these bands would re-unite again in the late 1990s or early 2000s , they never reached the commercial success they saw in the 1980s or early 1990s . Other bands such as Mötley Crüe and Poison saw personnel changes which impacted those bands ' commercial viability during the decade . In 1995 Van Halen released Balance , a multi-platinum seller that would be the band 's last with Sammy Hagar on vocals . In 1996 David Lee Roth returned briefly and his replacement , former Extreme singer Gary Cherone , was fired soon after the release of the commercially unsuccessful 1998 album Van Halen III and Van Halen would not tour or record again until 2004 . Guns N ' Roses ' original lineup was whittled away throughout the decade . Drummer Steven Adler was fired in 1990 , guitarist Izzy Stradlin left in late 1991 after recording Use Your Illusion I and II with the band . Tensions between the other band members and lead singer Axl Rose continued after the release of the 1993 covers album The Spaghetti Incident ? Guitarist Slash left in 1996 , followed by bassist Duff McKagan in 1997 . Axl Rose , the only original member , worked with a constantly changing lineup in recording an album that would take over fifteen years to complete .
Luther 's translation used the variant of German spoken at the Saxon chancellery , intelligible to both northern and southern Germans . He intended his vigorous , direct language to make the Bible accessible to everyday Germans , " for we are removing impediments and difficulties so that other people may read it without hindrance . "

Though Brazilians of at least partial African heritage make up a large percentage of the population , few blacks have been elected as politicians . The city of Salvador , Bahia , for instance , is 80 % people of color , but voters have not elected a mayor of color . Journalists like to say that US cities with black majorities , such as Detroit and New Orleans , have not elected white mayors since after the civil rights movement , when the Voting Rights Act of 1965 protected the franchise for minorities , and blacks in the South regained the power to vote for the first time since the turn of the 20th century . New Orleans elected its first black mayor in the 1970s . New Orleans elected a white mayor after the widescale disruption and damage of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 .
Egypt has hosted several international competitions . the last one was 2009 FIFA U-20 World Cup which took place between 24 September - 16 October 2009 . On Friday 19 September of the year 2014 , Guinness World Records has announced that Egyptian scuba diver Ahmed Gabr is the new title holder for deepest salt water scuba dive , at 332.35 metres . Ahmed set a new world record Friday when he reached a depth of more than 1,000 feet . The 14-hour feat took Gabr 1,066 feet down into the abyss near the Egyptian town of Dahab in ther Red Sea , where he works as a diving instructor .
Symptoms of mild zinc deficiency are diverse . Clinical outcomes include depressed growth , diarrhea , impotence and delayed sexual maturation , alopecia , eye and skin lesions , impaired appetite , altered cognition , impaired host defense properties , defects in carbohydrate utilization , and reproductive teratogenesis . Mild zinc deficiency depresses immunity , although excessive zinc does also . Animals with a diet deficient in zinc require twice as much food in order to attain the same weight gain as animals given sufficient zinc .
Ethnic Egyptians are by far the largest ethnic group in the country , constituting 91 % of the total population . Ethnic minorities include the Abazas , Turks , Greeks , Bedouin Arab tribes living in the eastern deserts and the Sinai Peninsula , the Berber-speaking Siwis ( Amazigh ) of the Siwa Oasis , and the Nubian communities clustered along the Nile . There are also tribal Beja communities concentrated in the south-eastern-most corner of the country , and a number of Dom clans mostly in the Nile Delta and Faiyum who are progressively becoming assimilated as urbanisation increases .
Zinc chloride is often added to lumber as a fire retardant and can be used as a wood preservative . It is also used to make other chemicals . Zinc methyl ( Zn ( CH3 ) 2 ) is used in a number of organic syntheses . Zinc sulfide ( ZnS ) is used in luminescent pigments such as on the hands of clocks , X-ray and television screens , and luminous paints . Crystals of ZnS are used in lasers that operate in the mid-infrared part of the spectrum . Zinc sulfate is a chemical in dyes and pigments . Zinc pyrithione is used in antifouling paints .
At the end of this speech , Luther raised his arm " in the traditional salute of a knight winning a bout . " Michael Mullett considers this speech as a " world classic of epoch-making oratory . "
At the very end of the 19th century , a new style , with a carved top and back construction inspired by violin family instruments began to supplant the European-style bowl-back instruments in the United States . This new style is credited to mandolins designed and built by Orville Gibson , a Kalamazoo , Michigan luthier who founded the " Gibson Mandolin-Guitar Manufacturing Co. , Limited " in 1902 . Gibson mandolins evolved into two basic styles : the Florentine or F-style , which has a decorative scroll near the neck , two points on the lower body and usually a scroll carved into the headstock ; and the A-style , which is pear shaped , has no points and usually has a simpler headstock .
In the United States , the game was televised by CBS , as part of a cycle between the three main broadcast television partners of the NFL . The network 's lead broadcast team of Jim Nantz and Phil Simms called the contest , with Tracy Wolfson and Evan Washburn on the sidelines . CBS introduced new features during the telecast , including pylon cameras and microphones along with EyeVision 360—an array of 36 cameras along the upper deck that can be used to provide a 360-degree view of plays and " bullet time " effects . ( An earlier version of EyeVision was last used in Super Bowl XXXV ; for Super Bowl 50 , the cameras were upgraded to 5K resolution . )
On June 4 , 2014 , the NFL announced that the practice of branding Super Bowl games with Roman numerals , a practice established at Super Bowl V , would be temporarily suspended , and that the game would be named using Arabic numerals as Super Bowl 50 as opposed to Super Bowl L. The use of Roman numerals will be reinstated for Super Bowl LI . Jaime Weston , the league 's vice president of brand and creative , explained that a primary reason for the change was the difficulty of designing an aesthetically pleasing logo with the letter " L " using the standardized logo template introduced at Super Bowl XLV . The logo also deviates from the template by featuring large numerals , colored in gold , behind the Vince Lombardi Trophy , instead of underneath and in silver as in the standard logo .
American University economist George Ayittey accused the Arab government of Sudan of practicing acts of racism against black citizens . According to Ayittey , " In Sudan ... the Arabs monopolized power and excluded blacks – Arab apartheid . " Many African commentators joined Ayittey in accusing Sudan of practising Arab apartheid .
In the late 1960s , the term heavy metal was used interchangeably with hard rock , but gradually began to be used to describe music played with even more volume and intensity . While hard rock maintained a bluesy rock and roll identity , including some swing in the back beat and riffs that tended to outline chord progressions in their hooks , heavy metal 's riffs often functioned as stand-alone melodies and had no swing in them . Heavy metal took on " darker " characteristics after Black Sabbath 's breakthrough at the beginning of the 1970s . In the 1980s it developed a number of subgenres , often termed extreme metal , some of which were influenced by hardcore punk , and which further differentiated the two styles . Despite this differentiation , hard rock and heavy metal have existed side by side , with bands frequently standing on the boundary of , or crossing between , the genres .
Rep. Christopher H. Smith ( R-NJ ) , criticized the State Department investigation , saying the investigators were shown " Potemkin Villages " where residents had been intimidated into lying about the family-planning program . Dr. Nafis Sadik , former director of UNFPA said her agency had been pivotal in reversing China 's coercive population control methods , but a 2005 report by Amnesty International and a separate report by the United States State Department found that coercive techniques were still regularly employed by the Chinese , casting doubt upon Sadik 's statements .
Due to the Ottoman slave trade that had flourished in the Balkans , the coastal town of Ulcinj in Montenegro had its own black community . As a consequence of the slave trade and privateer activity , it is told how until 1878 in Ulcinj 100 black people lived . The Ottoman Army also deployed an estimated 30,000 Black African troops and cavalrymen to its expedition in Hungary during the Austro-Turkish War of 1716–18 .
On 18 November 2015 , Sky announced Sky Q , a range of products and services to be available in 2016 . The Sky Q range consists of three set top boxes ( Sky Q , Sky Q Silver and Sky Q Mini ) , a broadband router ( Sky Q Hub ) and mobile applications .

The Sky Q Silver set top box is capable of receiving and displaying UHD broadcasts , which Sky will introduce later in 2016 .
Luther 's hymns inspired composers to write music . Johann Sebastian Bach included several verses as chorales in his cantatas and based chorale cantatas entirely on them , namely Christ lag in Todes Banden , BWV 4 , as early as possibly 1707 , in his second annual cycle ( 1724 to 1725 ) Ach Gott , vom Himmel sieh darein , BWV 2 , Christ unser Herr zum Jordan kam , BWV 7 , Nun komm , der Heiden Heiland , BWV 62 , Gelobet seist du , Jesu Christ , BWV 91 , and Aus tiefer Not schrei ich zu dir , BWV 38 , later Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott , BWV 80 , and in 1735 Wär Gott nicht mit uns diese Zeit , BWV 14 .

Johann Eck , speaking on behalf of the Empire as assistant of the Archbishop of Trier , presented Luther with copies of his writings laid out on a table and asked him if the books were his , and whether he stood by their contents . Luther confirmed he was their author , but requested time to think about the answer to the second question . He prayed , consulted friends , and gave his response the next day :
From the late 19th century , the South used a colloquial term , the one-drop rule , to classify as black a person of any known African ancestry . This practice of hypodescent was not put into law until the early 20th century . Legally the definition varied from state to state . Racial definition was more flexible in the 18th and 19th centuries before the American Civil War . For instance , President Thomas Jefferson held persons who were legally white ( less than 25 % black ) according to Virginia law at the time , but , because they were born to slave mothers , they were born into slavery , according to the principle of partus sequitur ventrem , which Virginia adopted into law in 1662 .
The Panthers used the San Jose State practice facility and stayed at the San Jose Marriott . The Broncos practiced at Stanford University and stayed at the Santa Clara Marriott .
Doug Morris , who was head of Warner Music Group , then Universal Music , became chairman and CEO of the company on July 1 , 2011 . Sony Music underwent a restructuring after Morris ' arrival . He was joined by L.A. Reid , who became the chairman and CEO of Epic Records . Under Reid , multiple artists from the Jive half of the former RCA/Jive Label Group moved to Epic . Peter Edge became the new CEO of the RCA Records unit . The RCA Music Group closed down Arista , J Records and Jive Records in October 2011 , with the artists from those labels being moved to RCA Records .
RCA/Jive Label Group CEO Barry Weiss left the company in March 2011 to become the new CEO of Island Def Jam and Universal Republic , which were both part of Universal Music Group . Weiss had been the RCA/Jive Label Group CEO since 2008 and was head of Jive Records since 1991 .
The second decline was not as complete as the first . Thousands of people had learned to play the instrument . Even as the second wave of mandolin popularity declined in the early 20th century , new versions of the mandolin began to be used in new forms of music . Luthiers created the resonator mandolin , the flatback mandolin , the carved-top or arched-top mandolin , the mandolin-banjo and the electric mandolin . Musicians began playing it in Celtic , Bluegrass , Jazz and Rock-n-Roll styles — and Classical too .
After a punt from both teams , Carolina got on track with a 9-play , 73-yard scoring drive . Newton completed 4 of 4 passes for 51 yards and rushed twice for 25 yards , while Jonathan Stewart finished the drive with a 1-yard touchdown run , cutting the score to 10–7 with 11:28 left in the second quarter . Later on , Broncos receiver Jordan Norwood received Brad Nortman 's short 28-yard punt surrounded by Panthers players , but none of them attempted to make a tackle , apparently thinking Norwood had called a fair catch . Norwood had not done so , and with no resistance around him , he took off for a Super Bowl record 61-yard return before Mario Addison dragged him down on the Panthers 14-yard line . Despite Denver 's excellent field position , they could not get the ball into the end zone , so McManus kicked a 33-yard field goal that increased their lead to 13–7 .

Luther made his pronouncements from Wartburg in the context of rapid developments at Wittenberg , of which he was kept fully informed . Andreas Karlstadt , supported by the ex-Augustinian Gabriel Zwilling , embarked on a radical programme of reform there in June 1521 , exceeding anything envisaged by Luther . The reforms provoked disturbances , including a revolt by the Augustinian friars against their prior , the smashing of statues and images in churches , and denunciations of the magistracy . After secretly visiting Wittenberg in early December 1521 , Luther wrote A Sincere Admonition by Martin Luther to All Christians to Guard Against Insurrection and Rebellion . Wittenberg became even more volatile after Christmas when a band of visionary zealots , the so-called Zwickau prophets , arrived , preaching revolutionary doctrines such as the equality of man , adult baptism , and Christ 's imminent return . When the town council asked Luther to return , he decided it was his duty to act .
For the first time , the Super Bowl 50 Host Committee and the NFL have openly sought disabled veteran and lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender-owned businesses in Business Connect , the Super Bowl program that provides local companies with contracting opportunities in and around the Super Bowl . The host committee has already raised over $ 40 million through sponsors including Apple , Google , Yahoo ! , Intel , Gap , Chevron , and Dignity Health .
Bern was occupied by French troops in 1798 during the French Revolutionary Wars , when it was stripped of parts of its territories . It regained control of the Bernese Oberland in 1802 , and following the Congress of Vienna of 1814 , it newly acquired the Bernese Jura . At this time , it once again became the largest canton of the confederacy as it stood during the Restoration and until the secession of the canton of Jura in 1979 . Bern was made the Federal City ( seat of the Federal Assembly ) within the new Swiss federal state in 1848 .
Numerous communities of dark-skinned peoples are present in North Africa , some dating from prehistoric communities . Others are descendants of the historical Trans-Saharan trade in peoples and/or , and after the Arab invasions of North Africa in the 7th century , descendants of slaves from the Arab Slave Trade in North Africa .
Egypt was producing 691,000 bbl/d of oil and 2,141.05 Tcf of natural gas ( in 2013 ) , which makes Egypt as the largest oil producer not member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries ( OPEC ) and the second-largest dry natural gas producer in Africa . In 2013 , Egypt was the largest consumer of oil and natural gas in Africa , as more than 20 % of total oil consumption and more than 40 % of total dry natural gas consumption in Africa . Also , Egypt possesses the largest oil refinery capacity in Africa 726,000 bbl/d ( in 2012 ) . Egypt is currently planning to build its first nuclear power plant in El Dabaa city , northern Egypt .
While these few hard rock bands managed to maintain success and popularity in the early part of the decade , alternative forms of hard rock achieved mainstream success in the form of grunge in the US and Britpop in the UK . This was particularly evident after the success of Nirvana 's Nevermind ( 1991 ) , which combined elements of hardcore punk and heavy metal into a " dirty " sound that made use of heavy guitar distortion , fuzz and feedback , along with darker lyrical themes than their " hair band " predecessors . Although most grunge bands had a sound that sharply contrasted mainstream hard rock , several , including Pearl Jam , Alice in Chains , Mother Love Bone and Soundgarden , were more strongly influenced by 1970s and 1980s rock and metal , while Stone Temple Pilots managed to turn alternative rock into a form of stadium rock . However , all grunge bands shunned the macho , anthemic and fashion-focused aesthetics particularly associated with glam metal . In the UK , Oasis were unusual among the Britpop bands of the mid-1990s in incorporating a hard rock sound .
Super Bowl 50 featured numerous records from individuals and teams . Denver won despite being massively outgained in total yards ( 315 to 194 ) and first downs ( 21 to 11 ) . Their 194 yards and 11 first downs were both the lowest totals ever by a Super Bowl winning team . The previous record was 244 yards by the Baltimore Ravens in Super Bowl XXXV . Only seven other teams had ever gained less than 200 yards in a Super Bowl , and all of them had lost . The Broncos ' seven sacks tied a Super Bowl record set by the Chicago Bears in Super Bowl XX . Kony Ealy tied a Super Bowl record with three sacks . Jordan Norwood 's 61-yard punt return set a new record , surpassing the old record of 45 yards set by John Taylor in Super Bowl XXIII . Denver was just 1-of-14 on third down , while Carolina was barely better at 3-of-15 . The two teams ' combined third down conversion percentage of 13.8 was a Super Bowl low . Manning and Newton had quarterback passer ratings of 56.6 and 55.4 , respectively , and their added total of 112 is a record lowest aggregate passer rating for a Super Bowl . Manning became the oldest quarterback ever to win a Super Bowl at age 39 , and the first quarterback ever to win a Super Bowl with two different teams , while Gary Kubiak became the first head coach to win a Super Bowl with the same franchise he went to the Super Bowl with as a player .
Bern lies on the Swiss plateau in the Canton of Bern , slightly west of the centre of Switzerland and 20 km ( 12 mi ) north of the Bernese Alps . The countryside around Bern was formed by glaciers during the most recent Ice Age . The two mountains closest to Bern are Gurten with a height of 864 m ( 2,835 ft ) and Bantiger with a height of 947 m ( 3,107 ft ) . The site of the old observatory in Bern is the point of origin of the CH1903 coordinate system at 46°57′08.66″N 7°26′22.50″E﻿ / ﻿46.9524056°N 7.4395833°E﻿ / 46.9524056 ; 7.4395833 .
Other major bluegrass mandolinists who emerged in the early 1950s and are still active include Jesse McReynolds ( of Jim and Jesse ) who invented a syncopated banjo-roll-like style called crosspicking—and Bobby Osborne of the Osborne Brothers , who is a master of clarity and sparkling single-note runs . Highly respected and influential modern bluegrass players include Herschel Sizemore , Doyle Lawson , and the multi-genre Sam Bush , who is equally at home with old-time fiddle tunes , rock , reggae , and jazz . Ronnie McCoury of the Del McCoury Band has won numerous awards for his Monroe-influenced playing . The late John Duffey of the original Country Gentlemen and later the Seldom Scene did much to popularize the bluegrass mandolin among folk and urban audiences , especially on the east coast and in the Washington , D.C. area .
Monroe 's style involved playing lead melodies in the style of a fiddler , and also a percussive chording sound referred to as " the chop " for the sound made by the quickly struck and muted strings . He also perfected a sparse , percussive blues style , especially up the neck in keys that had not been used much in country music , notably B and E. He emphasized a powerful , syncopated right hand at the expense of left-hand virtuosity . Monroe 's most influential follower of the second generation is Frank Wakefield and nowadays Mike Compton of the Nashville Bluegrass Band and David Long , who often tour as a duet . Tiny Moore of the Texas Playboys developed an electric five-string mandolin and helped popularize the instrument in Western Swing music .
Brass , which is an alloy of copper and zinc , has been used since at least the 10th century BC in Judea and by the 7th century BC in Ancient Greece . Zinc metal was not produced on a large scale until the 12th century in India and was unknown to Europe until the end of the 16th century . The mines of Rajasthan have given definite evidence of zinc production going back to the 6th century BC . To date , the oldest evidence of pure zinc comes from Zawar , in Rajasthan , as early as the 9th century AD when a distillation process was employed to make pure zinc . Alchemists burned zinc in air to form what they called " philosopher 's wool " or " white snow " .
Some established acts continued to enjoy commercial success , such as Aerosmith , with their number one multi-platinum albums : Get a Grip ( 1993 ) , which produced four Top 40 singles and became the band 's best-selling album worldwide ( going on to sell over 10 million copies ) , and Nine Lives ( 1997 ) . In 1998 , Aerosmith released the number one hit " I Do n't Want to Miss a Thing " , which remains the only single by a hard rock band to debut at number one . AC/DC produced the double platinum Ballbreaker ( 1995 ) . Bon Jovi appealed to their hard rock audience with songs such as " Keep the Faith " ( 1992 ) , but also achieved success in adult contemporary radio , with the Top 10 ballads " Bed of Roses " ( 1993 ) and " Always " ( 1994 ) . Bon Jovi 's 1995 album These Days was a bigger hit in Europe than it was in the United States , spawning four Top 10 singles on the UK Singles Chart . Metallica 's Load ( 1996 ) and ReLoad ( 1997 ) each sold in excess of 4 million copies in the US and saw the band develop a more melodic and blues rock sound . As the initial impetus of grunge bands faltered in the middle years of the decade , post-grunge bands emerged . They emulated the attitudes and music of grunge , particularly thick , distorted guitars , but with a more radio-friendly commercially oriented sound that drew more directly on traditional hard rock . Among the most successful acts were the Foo Fighters , Candlebox , Live , Collective Soul , Australia 's Silverchair and England 's Bush , who all cemented post-grunge as one of the most commercially viable subgenres by the late 1990s . Similarly , some post-Britpop bands that followed in the wake of Oasis , including Feeder and Stereophonics , adopted a hard rock or " pop-metal " sound .
In America , nonprofit organizations like Friends of UNFPA ( formerly Americans for UNFPA ) worked to compensate for the loss of United States federal funding by raising private donations .
Noteworthy Irish mandolinists include Andy Irvine ( who , like Johnny Moynihan , almost always tunes the top E down to D , to achieve an open tuning of GDAD ) , Paul Brady , Mick Moloney , Paul Kelly and Claudine Langille . John Sheahan and the late Barney McKenna , respectively fiddle player and tenor banjo player with The Dubliners , are also accomplished Irish mandolin players . The instruments used are either flat-backed , oval hole examples as described above ( made by UK luthier Roger Bucknall of Fylde Guitars ) , or carved-top , oval hole instruments with arched back ( made by Stefan Sobell in Northumberland ) . The Irish guitarist Rory Gallagher often played the mandolin on stage , and he most famously used it in the song " Going To My Hometown . "
RCA/Jive Label Group CEO Barry Weiss left the company in March 2011 to become the new CEO of Island Def Jam and Universal Republic , which were both part of Universal Music Group . Weiss had been the RCA/Jive Label Group CEO since 2008 and was head of Jive Records since 1991 .
Alloys of primarily zinc with small amounts of copper , aluminium , and magnesium are useful in die casting as well as spin casting , especially in the automotive , electrical , and hardware industries . These alloys are marketed under the name Zamak . An example of this is zinc aluminium . The low melting point together with the low viscosity of the alloy makes the production of small and intricate shapes possible . The low working temperature leads to rapid cooling of the cast products and therefore fast assembly is possible . Another alloy , marketed under the brand name Prestal , contains 78 % zinc and 22 % aluminium and is reported to be nearly as strong as steel but as malleable as plastic . This superplasticity of the alloy allows it to be molded using die casts made of ceramics and cement .
In 1523 , Luther wrote that Jesus Christ was born a Jew which discouraged mistreatment of the Jews and advocated their conversion by proving that the Old Testament could be shown to speak of Jesus Christ . However , as the Reformation continued , Luther began to lose hope in large-scale Jewish conversion to Christianity . In his later years , Luther grew more hostile toward the Jews , writing against them with the kind of venom he had already unleashed on the Anabaptists , Zwinglianism , and the papacy . His 1543 treatise Von den Juden und ihren Lügen ( On the Jews and Their Lies ) took its place among other anti-Jewish literature of the times , although historians acknowledge that this treatise was particularly extreme , even by the standards of sixteenth century Europe . In it , he takes a hardline against Judaism , writing that synagogues and Jewish homes should be destroyed , their money confiscated , and liberty curtailed . These statements and their influence on antisemitism have contributed to his controversial status .
BSkyB initially charged additional subscription fees for using a Sky+ PVR with their service ; waiving the charge for subscribers whose package included two or more premium channels . This changed as from 1 July 2007 , and now customers that have Sky+ and subscribe to any BSkyB subscription package get Sky+ included at no extra charge . Customers that do not subscribe to BSkyB 's channels can still pay a monthly fee to enable Sky+ functions . In January 2010 BSkyB discontinued the Sky+ Box , limited the standard Sky Box to Multiroom upgrade only and started to issue the Sky+HD Box as standard , thus giving all new subscribers the functions of Sky+ . In February 2011 BSkyB discontinued the non-HD variant of its Multiroom box , offering a smaller version of the SkyHD box without Sky+ functionality . In September 2007 , Sky launched a new TV advertising campaign targeting Sky+ at women . As of 31 March 2008 , Sky had 3,393,000 Sky+ users .
In late November 2015 , reports surfaced stating that " multiple acts " would perform during the halftime show . On December 3 , the league confirmed that the show would be headlined by the British rock group Coldplay . On January 7 , 2016 , Pepsi confirmed to the Associated Press that Beyoncé , who headlined the Super Bowl XLVII halftime show and collaborated with Coldplay on the single " Hymn for the Weekend " , would be making an appearance . Bruno Mars , who headlined the Super Bowl XLVIII halftime show , and Mark Ronson also performed .
The mandolin has been used occasionally in rock music , first appearing in the psychedelic era of the late 1960s . Levon Helm of The Band occasionally moved from his drum kit to play mandolin , most notably on Rag Mama Rag , Rockin ' Chair , and Evangeline . Ian Anderson of Jethro Tull played mandolin on Fat Man , from their second album , Stand Up , and also occasionally on later releases . Rod Stewart 's 1971 No . 1 hit Maggie May features a significant mandolin riff . David Grisman played mandolin on two Grateful Dead songs on the American Beauty album , Friend of the Devil and Ripple , which became instant favorites among amateur pickers at jam sessions and campground gatherings . John Paul Jones and Jimmy Page both played mandolin on Led Zeppelin songs . The popular alt rock group Imagine Dragons feature the mandolin on a few of their songs , most prominently being It 's Time . Dash Crofts of the soft rock duo Seals and Crofts extensively used mandolin in their repertoire during the 1970s . Styx released the song Boat on the River in 1980 , which featured Tommy Shaw on vocals and mandolin . The song did n't chart in the United States but was popular in much of Europe and the Philippines .
One of the most influential works during this burgeoning period was Niccolò Machiavelli 's The Prince , written between 1511–12 and published in 1532 , after Machiavelli 's death . That work , as well as The Discourses , a rigorous analysis of the classical period , did much to influence modern political thought in the West . A minority ( including Jean-Jacques Rousseau ) interpreted The Prince as a satire meant to be given to the Medici after their recapture of Florence and their subsequent expulsion of Machiavelli from Florence . Though the work was written for the di Medici family in order to perhaps influence them to free him from exile , Machiavelli supported the Republic of Florence rather than the oligarchy of the di Medici family . At any rate , Machiavelli presents a pragmatic and somewhat consequentialist view of politics , whereby good and evil are mere means used to bring about an end—i.e. , the secure and powerful state . Thomas Hobbes , well known for his theory of the social contract , goes on to expand this view at the start of the 17th century during the English Renaissance . Although neither Machiavelli nor Hobbes believed in the divine right of kings , they both believed in the inherent selfishness of the individual . It was necessarily this belief that led them to adopt a strong central power as the only means of preventing the disintegration of the social order .
In 1978 Aboriginal writer Kevin Gilbert received the National Book Council award for his book Living Black : Blacks Talk to Kevin Gilbert , a collection of Aboriginal people 's stories , and in 1998 was awarded ( but refused to accept ) the Human Rights Award for Literature for Inside Black Australia , a poetry anthology and exhibition of Aboriginal photography . In contrast to previous definitions based solely on the degree of Aboriginal ancestry , in 1990 the Government changed the legal definition of Aboriginal to include any :
Anthropologists have contributed to the debate by shifting the focus of research : One of the first challenges for the researcher wishing to carry out empirical research in this area is to identify an appropriate analytical tool . The concept of boundaries is useful here for demonstrating how identity works . In the same way as Barth , in his approach to ethnicity , advocated the critical focus for investigation as being " the ethnic boundary that defines the group rather than the cultural stuff that it encloses " ( 1969:15 ) , social anthropologists such as Cohen and Bray have shifted the focus of analytical study from identity to the boundaries that are used for purposes of identification . If identity is a kind of virtual site in which the dynamic processes and markers used for identification are made apparent , boundaries provide the framework on which this virtual site is built . They concentrated on how the idea of community belonging is differently constructed by individual members and how individuals within the group conceive ethnic boundaries .
Luther and his colleagues introduced the new order of worship during their visitation of the Electorate of Saxony , which began in 1527 . They also assessed the standard of pastoral care and Christian education in the territory . " Merciful God , what misery I have seen , " Luther wrote , " the common people knowing nothing at all of Christian doctrine ... and unfortunately many pastors are well-nigh unskilled and incapable of teaching . "
The celebrated John Duns Scotus ( d. 1308 ) , a Friar Minor like Saint Bonaventure , argued , on the contrary , that from a rational point of view it was certainly as little derogatory to the merits of Christ to assert that Mary was by him preserved from all taint of sin , as to say that she first contracted it and then was delivered . Proposing a solution to the theological problem of reconciling the doctrine with that of universal redemption in Christ , he argued that Mary 's immaculate conception did not remove her from redemption by Christ ; rather it was the result of a more perfect redemption granted her because of her special role in salvation history .
Critics note that people of color have limited media visibility . The Brazilian media has been accused of hiding or overlooking the nation 's Black , Indigenous , Multiracial and East Asian populations . For example , the telenovelas or soaps are criticized for featuring actors who resemble northern Europeans rather than actors of the more prevalent Southern European features ) and light-skinned mulatto and mestizo appearance . ( Pardos may achieve " white " status if they have attained the middle-class or higher social status ) .

Beside the introduction of the lute to Spain ( Andalusia ) by the Moors , another important point of transfer of the lute from Arabian to European culture was Sicily , where it was brought either by Byzantine or later by Muslim musicians . There were singer-lutenists at the court in Palermo following the Norman conquest of the island from the Muslims , and the lute is depicted extensively in the ceiling paintings in the Palermo ’ s royal Cappella Palatina , dedicated by the Norman King Roger II of Sicily in 1140 . His Hohenstaufen grandson Frederick II , Holy Roman Emperor ( 1194 - 1250 ) continued integrating Muslims into his court , including Moorish musicians . By the 14th century , lutes had disseminated throughout Italy and , probably because of the cultural influence of the Hohenstaufen kings and emperor , based in Palermo , the lute had also made significant inroads into the German-speaking lands .
In addition to the Vince Lombardi Trophy that all Super Bowl champions receive , the winner of Super Bowl 50 will also receive a large , 18-karat gold-plated " 50 " . Each digit will weigh 33 lb ( 15 kg ) for a total of 66 lb ( 30 kg ) . Like the Lombardi Trophy , the " 50 " will be designed by Tiffany & Co .
Brass , which is an alloy of copper and zinc , has been used since at least the 10th century BC in Judea and by the 7th century BC in Ancient Greece . Zinc metal was not produced on a large scale until the 12th century in India and was unknown to Europe until the end of the 16th century . The mines of Rajasthan have given definite evidence of zinc production going back to the 6th century BC . To date , the oldest evidence of pure zinc comes from Zawar , in Rajasthan , as early as the 9th century AD when a distillation process was employed to make pure zinc . Alchemists burned zinc in air to form what they called " philosopher 's wool " or " white snow " .
Another family of bowlback mandolins came from Milan and Lombardy . These mandolins are closer to the mandolino or mandore than other modern mandolins . They are shorter and wider than the standard Neapolitan mandolin , with a shallow back . The instruments have 6 strings , 3 wire treble-strings and 3 gut or wire-wrapped-silk bass-strings . The strings ran between the tuning pegs and a bridge that was glued to the soundboard , as a guitar 's . The Lombardic mandolins were tuned g b e ' a ' d " g " . A developer of the Milanese stye was Antonio Monzino ( Milan ) and his family who made them for 6 generations .
Miṣr ( IPA : [ mi̠sˤr ] or Egyptian Arabic pronunciation : [ mesˤɾ ] ; Arabic : مِصر‎ ) is the Classical Quranic Arabic and modern official name of Egypt , while Maṣr ( IPA : [ mɑsˤɾ ] ; Egyptian Arabic : مَصر ) is the local pronunciation in Egyptian Arabic . The name is of Semitic origin , directly cognate with other Semitic words for Egypt such as the Hebrew מִצְרַיִם ( Mitzráyim ) . The oldest attestation of this name for Egypt is the Akkadian 𒆳 𒈪 𒄑 𒊒 KURmi-iṣ-ru miṣru , related to miṣru/miṣirru/miṣaru , meaning " border " or " frontier " .
The popularity of this particular representation of The Immaculate Conception spread across the rest of Europe , and has since remained the best known artistic depiction of the concept : in a heavenly realm , moments after her creation , the spirit of Mary ( in the form of a young woman ) looks up in awe at ( or bows her head to ) God . The moon is under her feet and a halo of twelve stars surround her head , possibly a reference to " a woman clothed with the sun " from Revelation 12:1-2 . Additional imagery may include clouds , a golden light , and cherubs . In some paintings the cherubim are holding lilies and roses , flowers often associated with Mary .
In July 2013 , Sony Music withdrew from the Greek market due to an economic crisis . Albums released by Sony Music in Greece from domestic and foreign artists are carried by Feelgood Records .
Weinreich 's identity variant similarly includes the categories of identity diffusion , foreclosure and crisis , but with a somewhat different emphasis . Here , with respect to identity diffusion for example , an optimal level is interpreted as the norm , as it is unrealistic to expect an individual to resolve all their conflicted identifications with others ; therefore we should be alert to individuals with levels which are much higher or lower than the norm – highly diffused individuals are classified as diffused , and those with low levels as foreclosed or defensive . ( Weinreich & Saunderson , 2003 , pp 65–67 ; 105-106 ) . Weinreich applies the identity variant in a framework which also allows for the transition from one to another by way of biographical experiences and resolution of conflicted identifications situated in various contexts – for example , an adolescent going through family break-up may be in one state , whereas later in a stable marriage with a secure professional role may be in another . Hence , though there is continuity , there is also development and change . ( Weinreich & Saunderson , 2003 , pp 22–23 ) .
In honor of the 50th Super Bowl , the pregame ceremony featured the on-field introduction of 39 of the 43 previous Super Bowl Most Valuable Players . Bart Starr ( MVP of Super Bowls I and II ) and Chuck Howley ( MVP of Super Bowl V ) appeared via video , while Peyton Manning ( MVP of Super Bowl XLI and current Broncos quarterback ) was shown in the locker room preparing for the game . No plans were announced regarding the recognition of Harvey Martin , co-MVP of Super Bowl XII , who died in 2001 .
With 4:51 left in regulation , Carolina got the ball on their own 24-yard line with a chance to mount a game-winning drive , and soon faced 3rd-and-9 . On the next play , Miller stripped the ball away from Newton , and after several players dove for it , it took a long bounce backwards and was recovered by Ward , who returned it five yards to the Panthers 4-yard line . Although several players dove into the pile to attempt to recover it , Newton did not and his lack of aggression later earned him heavy criticism . Meanwhile , Denver 's offense was kept out of the end zone for three plays , but a holding penalty on cornerback Josh Norman gave the Broncos a new set of downs . Then Anderson scored on a 2-yard touchdown run and Manning completed a pass to Bennie Fowler for a 2-point conversion , giving Denver a 24–10 lead with 3:08 left and essentially putting the game away . Carolina had two more drives , but failed to get a first down on each one .
The Federal Palace ( Bundeshaus ) , built from 1857 to 1902 , which houses the national parliament , government and part of the federal administration , can also be visited .
Following the 1973 war and the subsequent peace treaty , Egypt became the first Arab nation to establish diplomatic relations with Israel . Despite that , Israel is still widely considered as a hostile state by the majority of Egyptians . Egypt has played a historical role as a mediator in resolving various disputes in the Middle East , most notably its handling of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the peace process . Egypt 's ceasefire and truce brokering efforts in Gaza have hardly been challenged following Israel 's evacuation of its settlements from the strip in 2005 , despite increasing animosity towards the Hamas government in Gaza following the ouster of Mohamed Morsi , and despite recent attempts by countries like Turkey and Qatar to take over this role .
However , this oft-quoted saying of Tetzel was by no means representative of contemporary Catholic teaching on indulgences , but rather a reflection of his capacity to exaggerate . Yet if Tetzel overstated the matter in regard to indulgences for the dead , his teaching on indulgences for the living was in line with Catholic dogma of the time .
Some rock musicians today use mandolins , often single-stringed electric models rather than double-stringed acoustic mandolins . One example is Tim Brennan of the Irish-American punk rock band Dropkick Murphys . In addition to electric guitar , bass , and drums , the band uses several instruments associated with traditional Celtic music , including mandolin , tin whistle , and Great Highland bagpipes . The band explains that these instruments accentuate the growling sound they favor . The 1991 R.E.M . hit " Losing My Religion " was driven by a few simple mandolin licks played by guitarist Peter Buck , who also played the mandolin in nearly a dozen other songs . The single peaked at No . 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart ( # 1 on the rock and alternative charts ) , Luther Dickinson of North Mississippi Allstars and The Black Crowes has made frequent use of the mandolin , most notably on the Black Crowes song " Locust Street . " Armenian American rock group System of A Down makes extensive use of the mandolin on their 2005 double album Mezmerize/Hypnotize . Pop punk band Green Day has used a mandolin in several occasions , especially on their 2000 album , Warning . Boyd Tinsley , violin player of the Dave Matthews Band has been using an electric mandolin since 2005 . Frontman Colin Meloy and guitarist Chris Funk of The Decemberists regularly employ the mandolin in the band 's music . Nancy Wilson , rhythm guitarist of Heart , uses a mandolin in Heart 's song " Dream of the Archer " from the album Little Queen , as well as in Heart 's cover of Led Zeppelin 's song " The Battle of Evermore . " " Show Me Heaven " by Maria McKee , the theme song to the film Days of Thunder , prominently features a mandolin .
Peyton Manning became the first quarterback ever to lead two different teams to multiple Super Bowls . He is also the oldest quarterback ever to play in a Super Bowl at age 39 . The past record was held by John Elway , who led the Broncos to victory in Super Bowl XXXIII at age 38 and is currently Denver 's Executive Vice President of Football Operations and General Manager .
As a result of modernisation efforts over the years , Egypt 's healthcare system has made great strides forward . Access to healthcare in both urban and rural areas greatly improved and immunisation programs are now able to cover 98 % of the population . Life expectancy increased from 44.8 years during the 1960s to 72.12 years in 2009 . There was a noticeable decline of the infant mortality rate ( during the 1970s to the 1980s the infant mortality rate was 101-132/1000 live births , in 2000 the rate was 50-60/1000 , and in 2008 it was 28-30/1000 ) .
Luther 's hymns were frequently evoked by particular events in his life and the unfolding Reformation . This behavior started with his learning of the execution of Johann Esch and Heinrich Voes , the first individuals to be martyred by the Roman Catholic Church for Lutheran views , prompting Luther to write the hymn " Ein neues Lied wir heben an " ( " A new song we raise " ) , which is generally known in English by John C. Messenger 's translation by the title and first line " Flung to the Heedless Winds " and sung to the tune Ibstone composed in 1875 by Maria C. Tiddeman .

His poor physical health made him short-tempered and even harsher in his writings and comments . His wife Katharina was overheard saying , " Dear husband , you are too rude , " and he responded , " They are teaching me to be rude . " In 1545 and 1546 Luther preached three times in the Market Church in Halle , staying with his friend Justus Jonas during Christmas .
RCA/Jive Label Group CEO Barry Weiss left the company in March 2011 to become the new CEO of Island Def Jam and Universal Republic , which were both part of Universal Music Group . Weiss had been the RCA/Jive Label Group CEO since 2008 and was head of Jive Records since 1991 .
Afro-Spaniards are Spanish nationals of West/Central African descent . They today mainly come from Angola , Brazil , Cameroon , Cape Verde , Equatorial Guinea , Ghana , Gambia , Guinea-Bissau , Mali , Nigeria and Senegal . Additionally , many Afro-Spaniards born in Spain are from the former Spanish colony Equatorial Guinea . Today , there are an estimated 683,000 Afro-Spaniards in Spain .
The mandolin has been used extensively in the traditional music of England and Scotland for generations . Simon Mayor is a prominent British player who has produced six solo albums , instructional books and DVDs , as well as recordings with his mandolin quartet the Mandolinquents . The instrument has also found its way into British rock music . The mandolin was played by Mike Oldfield ( and introduced by Vivian Stanshall ) on Oldfield 's album Tubular Bells , as well as on a number of his subsequent albums ( particularly prominently on Hergest Ridge ( 1974 ) and Ommadawn ( 1975 ) ) . It was used extensively by the British folk-rock band Lindisfarne , who featured two members on the instrument , Ray Jackson and Simon Cowe , and whose " Fog on the Tyne " was the biggest selling UK album of 1971-1972 . The instrument was also used extensively in the UK folk revival of the 1960s and 1970s with bands such as Fairport Convention and Steeleye Span taking it on as the lead instrument in many of their songs . Maggie May by Rod Stewart , which hit No . 1 on both the British charts and the Billboard Hot 100 , also featured Jackson 's playing . It has also been used by other British rock musicians . Led Zeppelin 's bassist John Paul Jones is an accomplished mandolin player and has recorded numerous songs on mandolin including Going to California and That 's the Way ; the mandolin part on The Battle of Evermore is played by Jimmy Page , who composed the song . Other Led Zeppelin songs featuring mandolin are Hey Hey What Can I Do , and Black Country Woman . Pete Townshend of The Who played mandolin on the track Mike Post Theme , along with many other tracks on Endless Wire . McGuinness Flint , for whom Graham Lyle played the mandolin on their most successful single , When I 'm Dead And Gone , is another example . Lyle was also briefly a member of Ronnie Lane 's Slim Chance , and played mandolin on their hit How Come . One of the more prominent early mandolin players in popular music was Robin Williamson in The Incredible String Band . Ian Anderson of Jethro Tull is a highly accomplished mandolin player ( beautiful track Pussy Willow ) , as is his guitarist Martin Barre . The popular song Please Please Please Let Me Get What I Want by The Smiths featured a mandolin solo played by Johnny Marr . More recently , the Glasgow-based band Sons and Daughters featured the mandolin , played by Ailidh Lennon , on tracks such as Fight , Start to End , and Medicine . British folk-punk icons the Levellers also regularly use the mandolin in their songs . Current bands are also beginning to use the Mandolin and its unique sound - such as South London 's Indigo Moss who use it throughout their recordings and live gigs . The mandolin has also featured in the playing of Matthew Bellamy in the rock band Muse . It also forms the basis of Paul McCartney 's 2007 hit " Dance Tonight . " That was not the first time a Beatle played a mandolin , however ; that distinction goes to George Harrison on Gone Troppo , the title cut from the 1982 album of the same name . The mandolin is taught in Lanarkshire by the Lanarkshire Guitar and Mandolin Association to over 100 people . Also more recently hard rock supergroup Them Crooked Vultures have been playing a song based primarily using a mandolin . This song was left off their debut album , and features former Led Zeppelin bassist John Paul Jones . [ citation needed ]

American University economist George Ayittey accused the Arab government of Sudan of practicing acts of racism against black citizens . According to Ayittey , " In Sudan ... the Arabs monopolized power and excluded blacks – Arab apartheid . " Many African commentators joined Ayittey in accusing Sudan of practising Arab apartheid .
Luther devised the catechism as a method of imparting the basics of Christianity to the congregations . In 1529 , he wrote the Large Catechism , a manual for pastors and teachers , as well as a synopsis , the Small Catechism , to be memorised by the people themselves . The catechisms provided easy-to-understand instructional and devotional material on the Ten Commandments , the Apostles ' Creed , the Lord 's Prayer , baptism , and the Lord 's Supper . Luther incorporated questions and answers in the catechism so that the basics of Christian faith would not just be learned by rote , " the way monkeys do it " , but understood .
Super Bowl 50 featured numerous records from individuals and teams . Denver won despite being massively outgained in total yards ( 315 to 194 ) and first downs ( 21 to 11 ) . Their 194 yards and 11 first downs were both the lowest totals ever by a Super Bowl winning team . The previous record was 244 yards by the Baltimore Ravens in Super Bowl XXXV . Only seven other teams had ever gained less than 200 yards in a Super Bowl , and all of them had lost . The Broncos ' seven sacks tied a Super Bowl record set by the Chicago Bears in Super Bowl XX . Kony Ealy tied a Super Bowl record with three sacks . Jordan Norwood 's 61-yard punt return set a new record , surpassing the old record of 45 yards set by John Taylor in Super Bowl XXIII . Denver was just 1-of-14 on third down , while Carolina was barely better at 3-of-15 . The two teams ' combined third down conversion percentage of 13.8 was a Super Bowl low . Manning and Newton had quarterback passer ratings of 56.6 and 55.4 , respectively , and their added total of 112 is a record lowest aggregate passer rating for a Super Bowl . Manning became the oldest quarterback ever to win a Super Bowl at age 39 , and the first quarterback ever to win a Super Bowl with two different teams , while Gary Kubiak became the first head coach to win a Super Bowl with the same franchise he went to the Super Bowl with as a player .
CBS set the base rate for a 30-second advertisement at $ 5,000,000 , a record high price for a Super Bowl ad . As of January 26 , the advertisements had not yet sold out . CBS mandated that all advertisers purchase a package covering time on both the television and digital broadcasts of the game , meaning that for the first time , digital streams of the game would carry all national advertising in pattern with the television broadcast . This would be the final year in a multi-year contract with Anheuser-Busch InBev that allowed the beer manufacturer to air multiple advertisements during the game at a steep discount . It was also the final year that Doritos , a longtime sponsor of the game , held its " Crash the Super Bowl " contest that allowed viewers to create their own Doritos ads for a chance to have it aired during the game . Nintendo and The Pokémon Company also made their Super Bowl debut , promoting the 20th anniversary of the Pokémon video game and media franchise .
The Broncos defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers in the divisional round , 23–16 , by scoring 11 points in the final three minutes of the game . They then beat the defending Super Bowl XLIX champion New England Patriots in the AFC Championship Game , 20–18 , by intercepting a pass on New England 's 2-point conversion attempt with 17 seconds left on the clock . Despite Manning 's problems with interceptions during the season , he did n't throw any in their two playoff games .
Groups that emerged from the American psychedelic scene about the same time included Iron Butterfly , MC5 , Blue Cheer and Vanilla Fudge . San Francisco band Blue Cheer released a crude and distorted cover of Eddie Cochran 's classic " Summertime Blues " , from their 1968 debut album Vincebus Eruptum , that outlined much of the later hard rock and heavy metal sound . The same month , Steppenwolf released its self-titled debut album , including " Born to Be Wild " , which contained the first lyrical reference to heavy metal and helped popularise the style when it was used in the film Easy Rider ( 1969 ) . Iron Butterfly 's In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida ( 1968 ) , with its 17-minute-long title track , using organs and with a lengthy drum solo , also prefigured later elements of the sound .
Luther 's rediscovery of " Christ and His salvation " was the first of two points that became the foundation for the Reformation . His railing against the sale of indulgences was based on it .
In early times , the privilege of papal election was not reserved to the cardinals , and for centuries the person elected was customarily a Roman priest and never a bishop from elsewhere . To preserve apostolic succession the rite of consecrating him a bishop had to be performed by someone who was already a bishop . The rule remains that , if the person elected Pope is not yet a bishop , he is consecrated by the Dean of the College of Cardinals , the Cardinal Bishop of Ostia .
Alan Dershowitz described Sudan as an example of a government that " actually deserve ( s ) " the appellation " apartheid . " Former Canadian Minister of Justice Irwin Cotler echoed the accusation .
Samuel Adelstein described the Lombardi mandolin in 1893 as wider and shorter than the Neapolitan mandolin , with a shallower back and a shorter and wider neck , with six single strings to the regular mandolin 's set of 4 . The Lombardi was tuned C , D , A , E , B , G. The strings were fastened to the bridge like a guitar 's . There were 20 frets , covering three octaves , with an additional 5 notes . When Adelstein wrote , there were no nylon strings , and the gut and single strings " do not vibrate so clearly and sweetly as the double steel string of the Neapolitan . "
Luther was a prolific hymn-writer , authoring hymns such as " Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott " ( " A Mighty Fortress Is Our God " ) , based on Psalm 46 , and " Vom Himmel hoch , da komm ich her " ( " From Heaven Above to Earth I Come " ) , based on Luke 2:11–12 . Luther connected high art and folk music , also all classes , clergy and laity , men , women and children . His tool of choice for this connection was the singing of German hymns in connection with worship , school , home , and the public arena . He often accompanied the sung hymns with a lute , later recreated as the waldzither that became a national instrument of Germany in the 20th century .
At the end of this speech , Luther raised his arm " in the traditional salute of a knight winning a bout . " Michael Mullett considers this speech as a " world classic of epoch-making oratory . "
With over 90 million inhabitants , Egypt is the most populous country in North Africa and the Arab World , the third-most populous in Africa ( after Nigeria and Ethiopia ) , and the fifteenth-most populous in the world . The great majority of its people live near the banks of the Nile River , an area of about 40,000 square kilometres ( 15,000 sq mi ) , where the only arable land is found . The large regions of the Sahara desert , which constitute most of Egypt 's territory , are sparsely inhabited . About half of Egypt 's residents live in urban areas , with most spread across the densely populated centres of greater Cairo , Alexandria and other major cities in the Nile Delta .
The Ten Commandments , and the beginnings of the renewed life of Christians accorded to them by the sacrament of baptism , are a present foreshadowing of the believers ' future angel-like life in heaven in the midst of this life . Luther 's teaching of the Ten Commandments , therefore , has clear eschatological overtones , which , characteristically for Luther , do not encourage world-flight but direct the Christian to service to the neighbor in the common , daily vocations of this perishing world .
Although not yet tested as a therapy in humans , a growing body of evidence indicates that zinc may preferentially kill prostate cancer cells . Because zinc naturally homes to the prostate and because the prostate is accessible with relatively non-invasive procedures , its potential as a chemotherapeutic agent in this type of cancer has shown promise . However , other studies have demonstrated that chronic use of zinc supplements in excess of the recommended dosage may actually increase the chance of developing prostate cancer , also likely due to the natural buildup of this heavy metal in the prostate .
According to scholars Walter Krämer , Götz Trenkler , Gerhard Ritter , and Gerhard Prause , the story of the posting on the door , even though it has settled as one of the pillars of history , has little foundation in truth . The story is based on comments made by Philipp Melanchthon , though it is thought that he was not in Wittenberg at the time .
As opposed to broadcasts of primetime series , CBS broadcast special episodes of its late night talk shows as its lead-out programs for Super Bowl 50 , beginning with a special episode of The Late Show with Stephen Colbert following the game . Following a break for late local programming , CBS also aired a special episode of The Late Late Show with James Corden .
The Negritos are believed to be the first inhabitants of Southeast Asia . Once inhabiting Taiwan , Vietnam , and various other parts of Asia , they are now confined primarily to Thailand , the Malay Archipelago , and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands . Negrito means " little black people " in Spanish ( negrito is the Spanish diminutive of negro , i.e. , " little black person " ) ; it is what the Spaniards called the short-statured , hunter-gatherer autochthones that they encountered in the Philippines . Despite this , Negritos are never referred to as black today , and doing so would cause offense . The term Negrito itself has come under criticism in countries like Malaysia , where it is now interchangeable with the more acceptable Semang , although this term actually refers to a specific group . The common Thai word for Negritos literally means " frizzy hair " .
Mary 's complete sinlessness and concomitant exemption from any taint from the first moment of her existence was a doctrine familiar to Greek theologians of Byzantium . Beginning with St. Gregory Nazianzen , his explanation of the " purification " of Jesus and Mary at the circumcision ( Luke 2:22 ) prompted him to consider the primary meaning of " purification " in Christology ( and by extension in Mariology ) to refer to a perfectly sinless nature that manifested itself in glory in a moment of grace ( e.g. , Jesus at his Baptism ) . St. Gregory Nazianzen designated Mary as " prokathartheisa ( prepurified ) . " Gregory likely attempted to solve the riddle of the Purification of Jesus and Mary in the Temple through considering the human natures of Jesus and Mary as equally holy and therefore both purified in this manner of grace and glory . Gregory 's doctrines surrounding Mary 's purification were likely related to the burgeoning commemoration of the Mother of God in and around Constantinople very close to the date of Christmas . Nazianzen 's title of Mary at the Annunciation as " prepurified " was subsequently adopted by all theologians interested in his Mariology to justify the Byzantine equivalent of the Immaculate Conception . This is especially apparent in the Fathers St. Sophronios of Jerusalem and St. John Damascene , who will be treated below in this article at the section on Church Fathers . About the time of Damascene , the public celebration of the " Conception of St. Ann [ i.e. , of the Theotokos in her womb ] " was becoming popular . After this period , the " purification " of the perfect natures of Jesus and Mary would not only mean moments of grace and glory at the Incarnation and Baptism and other public Byzantine liturgical feasts , but purification was eventually associated with the feast of Mary 's very conception ( along with her Presentation in the Temple as a toddler ) by Orthodox authors of the 2nd millennium ( e.g. , St. Nicholas Cabasilas and Joseph Bryennius ) .
But Amnesty International found no evidence that UNFPA had supported the coercion . A 2001 study conducted by the pro-life Population Research Institute ( PRI ) falsely claimed that the UNFPA shared an office with the Chinese family planning officials who were carrying out forced abortions . " We located the family planning offices , and in that family planning office , we located the UNFPA office , and we confirmed from family planning officials there that there is no distinction between what the UNFPA does and what the Chinese Family Planning Office does , " said Scott Weinberg , a spokesman for PRI . However , United Nations Members disagreed and approved UNFPA ’ s new country program me in January 2006 . The more than 130 members of the “ Group of 77 ” developing countries in the United Nations expressed support for the UNFPA programmes . In addition , speaking for European democracies -- Norway , Denmark , Sweden , Finland , the Netherlands , France , Belgium , Switzerland and Germany -- the United Kingdom stated , ” UNFPA ’ s activities in China , as in the rest of the world , are in strict conformity with the unanimously adopted Programme of Action of the ICPD , and play a key role in supporting our common endeavor , the promotion and protection of all human rights and fundamental freedoms . ”
The term " retro-metal " has been applied to such bands as Texas based The Sword , California 's High on Fire , Sweden 's Witchcraft and Australia 's Wolfmother . Wolfmother 's self-titled 2005 debut album combined elements of the sounds of Deep Purple and Led Zeppelin . Fellow Australians Airbourne 's début album Runnin ' Wild ( 2007 ) followed in the hard riffing tradition of AC/DC . England 's The Darkness ' Permission to Land ( 2003 ) , described as an " eerily realistic simulation of '80s metal and '70s glam " , topped the UK charts , going quintuple platinum . The follow-up , One Way Ticket to Hell ... and Back ( 2005 ) , reached number 11 , before the band broke up in 2006 . Los Angeles band Steel Panther managed to gain a following by sending up 80s glam metal . A more serious attempt to revive glam metal was made by bands of the sleaze metal movement in Sweden , including Vains of Jenna , Hardcore Superstar and Crashdïet .
In early modern times , cardinals often had important roles in secular affairs . In some cases , they took on powerful positions in government . In Henry VIII 's England , his chief minister was Cardinal Wolsey . Cardinal Richelieu 's power was so great that he was for many years effectively the ruler of France . Richelieu successor was also a cardinal , Jules Mazarin . Guillaume Dubois and André-Hercule de Fleury complete the list of the " four great " cardinals to have ruled France . [ citation needed ] In Portugal , due to a succession crisis , one cardinal , Henry , King of Portugal , was crowned king , the only example of a cardinal-king .
In 1975 , Sadat shifted Nasser 's economic policies and sought to use his popularity to reduce government regulations and encourage foreign investment through his program of Infitah . Through this policy , incentives such as reduced taxes and import tariffs attracted some investors , but investments were mainly directed at low risk and profitable ventures like tourism and construction , abandoning Egypt 's infant industries . Even though Sadat 's policy was intended to modernise Egypt and assist the middle class , it mainly benefited the higher class , and , because of the elimination of subsidies on basic foodstuffs , led to the 1977 Egyptian Bread Riots .
In 1960 , Columbia/CBS began negotiations with its main international distributor Philips Records with the goal of CBS starting its own global record company . Philips ' acquisition of Mercury Records in the US in 1961 paved the way for this . CBS only had the rights to the Columbia name in North America ; therefore the international arm founded in 1961 and launched in 1962 utilized the " CBS Records " name only , with Philips Records distributing the label in Europe . CBS 's Mexican record company , Discos Columbia , was renamed Discos CBS by 1963 .
Luther spoke out against the Jews in Saxony , Brandenburg , and Silesia . Josel of Rosheim , the Jewish spokesman who tried to help the Jews of Saxony in 1537 , later blamed their plight on " that priest whose name was Martin Luther—may his body and soul be bound up in hell ! —who wrote and issued many heretical books in which he said that whoever would help the Jews was doomed to perdition . " Josel asked the city of Strasbourg to forbid the sale of Luther 's anti-Jewish works : they refused initially , but did so when a Lutheran pastor in Hochfelden used a sermon to urge his parishioners to murder Jews . Luther 's influence persisted after his death . Throughout the 1580s , riots led to the expulsion of Jews from several German Lutheran states .
From December 1539 , Luther became implicated in the bigamy of Philip I , Landgrave of Hesse , who wanted to marry one of his wife 's ladies-in-waiting . Philip solicited the approval of Luther , Melanchthon , and Bucer , citing as a precedent the polygamy of the patriarchs . The theologians were not prepared to make a general ruling , and they reluctantly advised the landgrave that if he was determined , he should marry secretly and keep quiet about the matter . As a result , on 4 March 1540 , Philip married a second wife , Margarethe von der Saale , with Melanchthon and Bucer among the witnesses . However , Philip was unable to keep the marriage secret , and he threatened to make Luther 's advice public . Luther told him to " tell a good , strong lie " and deny the marriage completely , which Philip did during the subsequent public controversy . In the view of Luther 's biographer Martin Brecht , " giving confessional advice for Philip of Hesse was one of the worst mistakes Luther made , and , next to the landgrave himself , who was directly responsible for it , history chiefly holds Luther accountable " . Brecht argues that Luther 's mistake was not that he gave private pastoral advice , but that he miscalculated the political implications . The affair caused lasting damage to Luther 's reputation .
Many adaptations of the instrument have been done to cater to the special needs of Indian Carnatic music . In Indian classical music and Indian light music , the mandolin , which bears little resemblance to the European mandolin , is usually tuned E-B-E-B . As there is no concept of absolute pitch in Indian classical music , any convenient tuning maintaining these relative pitch intervals between the strings can be used . Another prevalent tuning with these intervals is C-G-C-G , which corresponds to Sa-Pa-Sa-Pa in the Indian carnatic classical music style . This tuning corresponds to the way violins are tuned for carnatic classical music . This type of mandolin is also used in Bhangra , dance music popular in Punjabi culture .
On 31 October 1517 , Luther wrote to his bishop , Albert of Mainz , protesting the sale of indulgences . He enclosed in his letter a copy of his " Disputation of Martin Luther on the Power and Efficacy of Indulgences " , which came to be known as The Ninety-Five Theses . Hans Hillerbrand writes that Luther had no intention of confronting the church , but saw his disputation as a scholarly objection to church practices , and the tone of the writing is accordingly " searching , rather than doctrinaire . " Hillerbrand writes that there is nevertheless an undercurrent of challenge in several of the theses , particularly in Thesis 86 , which asks : " Why does the pope , whose wealth today is greater than the wealth of the richest Crassus , build the basilica of St. Peter with the money of poor believers rather than with his own money ? "
Denver took the opening kickoff and started out strong with Peyton Manning completing an 18-yard pass to tight end Owen Daniels and a 22-yard throw to receiver Andre Caldwell . A pair of carries by C. J. Anderson moved the ball up 20 yards to the Panthers 14-yard line , but Carolina 's defense dug in over the next three plays . First , linebacker Shaq Thompson tackled Ronnie Hillman for a 3-yard loss . Then after an incompletion , Thomas Davis tackled Anderson for a 1-yard gain on third down , forcing Denver to settle for a 3–0 lead on a Brandon McManus 34-yard field goal . The score marked the first time in the entire postseason that Carolina was facing a deficit .
In the autumn of 1991 , talks were held for the broadcast rights for Premier League for a five-year period , from the 1992 season . ITV were the current rights holders , and fought hard to retain the new rights . ITV had increased its offer from £18m to £34m per year to keep control of the rights . BSkyB joined forces with the BBC to make a counter bid . The BBC was given the highlights of most of the matches , while BSkyB paying £304m for the Premier League rights , would give them a monopoly of all live matches , up to 60 per year from the 1992 season . Murdoch described sport as a " battering ram " for pay-television , providing a strong customer base . A few weeks after the deal , ITV went to the High Court to get an injunction as it believed their bid details had been leaked before the decision was taken . ITV also asked the Office of Fair Trading to investigate since it believed Rupert Murdoch 's media empire via its newspapers had influenced the deal . A few days later neither action took effect , ITV believed BSkyB was telephoned and informed of its £262m bid , and Premier League advised BSkyB to increase its counter bid .
At various times , there have been cardinals who had only received first tonsure and minor orders but not yet been ordained as deacons or priests . Though clerics , they were inaccurately called " lay cardinals " and were permitted to marry . Teodolfo Mertel was among the last of the lay cardinals . When he died in 1899 he was the last surviving cardinal who was not at least ordained a priest . With the revision of the Code of Canon Law promulgated in 1917 by Pope Benedict XV , only those who are already priests or bishops may be appointed cardinals . Since the time of Pope John XXIII a priest who is appointed a cardinal must be consecrated a bishop , unless he obtains a dispensation .
The Neapolitan style has an almond-shaped body resembling a bowl , constructed from curved strips of wood . It usually has a bent sound table , canted in two planes with the design to take the tension of the 8 metal strings arranged in four courses . A hardwood fingerboard sits on top of or is flush with the sound table . Very old instruments may use wooden tuning pegs , while newer instruments tend to use geared metal tuners . The bridge is a movable length of hardwood . A pickguard is glued below the sound hole under the strings . European roundbacks commonly use a 13-inch scale instead of the 13.876 common on archtop Mandolins .
Egypt 's economy depends mainly on agriculture , media , petroleum imports , natural gas , and tourism ; there are also more than three million Egyptians working abroad , mainly in Saudi Arabia , the Persian Gulf and Europe . The completion of the Aswan High Dam in 1970 and the resultant Lake Nasser have altered the time-honored place of the Nile River in the agriculture and ecology of Egypt . A rapidly growing population , limited arable land , and dependence on the Nile all continue to overtax resources and stress the economy .
Following their loss in the divisional round of the previous season 's playoffs , the Denver Broncos underwent numerous coaching changes , including a mutual parting with head coach John Fox ( who had won four divisional championships in his four years as Broncos head coach ) , and the hiring of Gary Kubiak as the new head coach . Under Kubiak , the Broncos planned to install a run-oriented offense with zone blocking to blend in with quarterback Peyton Manning 's shotgun passing skills , but struggled with numerous changes and injuries to the offensive line , as well as Manning having his worst statistical season since his rookie year with the Indianapolis Colts in 1998 , due to a plantar fasciitis injury in his heel that he had suffered since the summer , and the simple fact that Manning was getting old , as he turned 39 in the 2015 off-season . Although the team had a 7–0 start , Manning led the NFL in interceptions . In week 10 , Manning suffered a partial tear of the plantar fasciitis in his left foot . He set the NFL 's all-time record for career passing yards in this game , but was benched after throwing four interceptions in favor of backup quarterback Brock Osweiler , who took over as the starter for most of the remainder of the regular season . Osweiler was injured , however , leading to Manning 's return during the Week 17 regular season finale , where the Broncos were losing 13–7 against the 4–11 San Diego Chargers , resulting in Manning re-claiming the starting quarterback position for the playoffs by leading the team to a key 27–20 win that enabled the team to clinch the number one overall AFC seed . Under defensive coordinator Wade Phillips , the Broncos ' defense ranked number one in total yards allowed , passing yards allowed and sacks , and like the previous three seasons , the team has continued to set numerous individual , league and franchise records . With the defense carrying the team despite the issues with the offense , the Broncos finished the regular season with a 12–4 record and earned home-field advantage throughout the AFC playoffs .
The medieval city is a foundation of the Zähringer ruling family , which rose to power in Upper Burgundy in the 12th century . According to 14th century historiography ( Cronica de Berno , 1309 ) , Bern was founded in 1191 by Berthold V , Duke of Zähringen .
The theologians , including Zwingli , Melanchthon , Martin Bucer , and Johannes Oecolampadius , differed on the significance of the words spoken by Jesus at the Last Supper : " This is my body which is for you " and " This cup is the new covenant in my blood " ( 1 Corinthians 11:23–26 ) . Luther insisted on the Real Presence of the body and blood of Christ in the consecrated bread and wine , which he called the sacramental union , while his opponents believed God to be only spiritually or symbolically present . Zwingli , for example , denied Jesus ' ability to be in more than one place at a time but Luther stressed the omnipresence of his human nature . According to transcripts , the debate sometimes became confrontational . Citing Jesus ' words " The flesh profiteth nothing " ( John 6.63 ) , Zwingli said , " This passage breaks your neck " . " Do n't be too proud , " Luther retorted , " German necks do n't break that easily . This is Hesse , not Switzerland . " On his table Luther wrote the words " Hoc est corpus meum " ( " This is my body " ) in chalk , to continually indicate his firm stance .
After a major blaze in 1405 , the city 's original wooden buildings were gradually replaced by half-timbered houses and subsequently the sandstone buildings which came to be characteristic for the Old Town . Despite the waves of pestilence that hit Europe in the 14th century , the city continued to grow : mainly due to immigration from the surrounding countryside .
Constitutional changes voted on 19 March 2007 prohibited parties from using religion as a basis for political activity , allowed the drafting of a new anti-terrorism law , authorised broad police powers of arrest and surveillance , and gave the president power to dissolve parliament and end judicial election monitoring . In 2009 , Dr. Ali El Deen Hilal Dessouki , Media Secretary of the National Democratic Party ( NDP ) , described Egypt as a " pharaonic " political system , and democracy as a " long-term goal " . Dessouki also stated that " the real center of power in Egypt is the military " .
Egypt has hosted several international competitions . the last one was 2009 FIFA U-20 World Cup which took place between 24 September - 16 October 2009 . On Friday 19 September of the year 2014 , Guinness World Records has announced that Egyptian scuba diver Ahmed Gabr is the new title holder for deepest salt water scuba dive , at 332.35 metres . Ahmed set a new world record Friday when he reached a depth of more than 1,000 feet . The 14-hour feat took Gabr 1,066 feet down into the abyss near the Egyptian town of Dahab in ther Red Sea , where he works as a diving instructor .
Mandolin has also been used in blues music , most notably by Ry Cooder , who performed outstanding covers on his very first recordings , Yank Rachell , Johnny " Man " Young , Carl Martin , and Gerry Hundt . Howard Armstrong , who is famous for blues violin , got his start with his father 's mandolin and played in string bands similar to the other Tennessee string bands he came into contact with , with band makeup including " mandolins and fiddles and guitars and banjos . And once in a while they would ease a little ukulele in there and a bass fiddle . " Other blues players from the era 's string bands include Willie Black ( Whistler And His Jug Band ) , Dink Brister , Jim Hill , Charles Johnson , Coley Jones ( Dallas String Band ) , Bobby Leecan ( Need More Band ) , Alfred Martin , Charlie McCoy ( 1909-1950 ) , Al Miller , Matthew Prater , and Herb Quinn .
Samuel Adelstein described the Lombardi mandolin in 1893 as wider and shorter than the Neapolitan mandolin , with a shallower back and a shorter and wider neck , with six single strings to the regular mandolin 's set of 4 . The Lombardi was tuned C , D , A , E , B , G. The strings were fastened to the bridge like a guitar 's . There were 20 frets , covering three octaves , with an additional 5 notes . When Adelstein wrote , there were no nylon strings , and the gut and single strings " do not vibrate so clearly and sweetly as the double steel string of the Neapolitan . "

In mid May 1967 , the Soviet Union issued warnings to Nasser of an impending Israeli attack on Syria . Although the chief of staff Mohamed Fawzi verified them as " baseless " , Nasser took three successive steps that made the war virtually inevitable : On 14 May he deployed his troops in Sinai near the border with Israel , on 19 May he expelled the UN peacekeepers stationed in the Sinai Peninsula border with Israel , and on 23 May he closed the Straits of Tiran to Israeli shipping . On 26 May Nasser declared , " The battle will be a general one and our basic objective will be to destroy Israel " .
Concerns were raised over whether Levi 's Stadium 's field was of a high enough quality to host a Super Bowl ; during the inaugural season , the field had to be re-sodded multiple times due to various issues , and during a week 6 game earlier in the 2015 season , a portion of the turf collapsed under Baltimore Ravens kicker Justin Tucker , causing him to slip and miss a field goal , although the field has not had any major issues since . As is customary for Super Bowl games played at natural grass stadiums , the NFL re-sodded the field with a new playing surface ; a hybrid Bermuda 419 turf . NFL and Atlanta Braves field director Ed Mangan stated that the field was in " great shape " for gameday . However , the turf showed problem throughout the game , with a number of players needing to change their cleats during the game and player slipping during plays all throughout the game .
Antonio Vivaldi composed a mandolin concerto ( Concerto in C major Op.3 6 ) and two concertos for two mandolins and orchestra . Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart placed it in his 1787 work Don Giovanni and Beethoven created four variations of it . Antonio Maria Bononcini composed La conquista delle Spagne di Scipione Africano il giovane in 1707 and George Frideric Handel composed Alexander Balus in 1748 . Others include Giovani Battista Gervasio ( Sonata in D major for Mandolin and Basso Continuo ) , Giuseppe Giuliano ( Sonata in D major for Mandolin and Basso Continuo ) , Emanuele Barbella ( Sonata in D major for Mandolin and Basso Continuo ) , Domenico Scarlatti ( Sonata n.54 ( K.89 ) in D minor for Mandolin and Basso Continuo ) , and Addiego Guerra ( Sonata in G major for Mandolin and Basso Continuo ) .
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) has stated that zinc damages nerve receptors in the nose , which can cause anosmia . Reports of anosmia were also observed in the 1930s when zinc preparations were used in a failed attempt to prevent polio infections . On June 16 , 2009 , the FDA said that consumers should stop using zinc-based intranasal cold products and ordered their removal from store shelves . The FDA said the loss of smell can be life-threatening because people with impaired smell can not detect leaking gas or smoke and can not tell if food has spoiled before they eat it . Recent research suggests that the topical antimicrobial zinc pyrithione is a potent heat shock response inducer that may impair genomic integrity with induction of PARP-dependent energy crisis in cultured human keratinocytes and melanocytes .
Sony Music Entertainment Inc. ( sometimes known as Sony Music or by the initials , SME ) is an American music corporation managed and operated by Sony Corporation of America ( SCA ) , a subsidiary of Japanese conglomerate Sony Corporation . In 1929 , the enterprise was first founded as American Record Corporation ( ARC ) and , in 1938 , was renamed Columbia Recording Corporation , following ARC 's acquisition by CBS . In 1966 , the company was reorganized to become CBS Records . In 1987 , Sony Corporation of Japan bought the company , and in 1991 , renamed it SME . It is the world 's second largest recorded music company , after Universal Music Group .
Luther 's translation used the variant of German spoken at the Saxon chancellery , intelligible to both northern and southern Germans . He intended his vigorous , direct language to make the Bible accessible to everyday Germans , " for we are removing impediments and difficulties so that other people may read it without hindrance . "
Indian political philosophy evolved in ancient times and demarcated a clear distinction between ( 1 ) nation and state ( 2 ) religion and state . The constitutions of Hindu states evolved over time and were based on political and legal treatises and prevalent social institutions . The institutions of state were broadly divided into governance , administration , defense , law and order . Mantranga , the principal governing body of these states , consisted of the King , Prime Minister , Commander in chief of army , Chief Priest of the King . The Prime Minister headed the committee of ministers along with head of executive ( Maha Amatya ) .
Zinc ( I ) compounds are rare , and require bulky ligands to stabilize the low oxidation state . Most zinc ( I ) compounds contain formally the [ Zn2 ] 2+ core , which is analogous to the [ Hg2 ] 2+ dimeric cation present in mercury ( I ) compounds . The diamagnetic nature of the ion confirms its dimeric structure . The first zinc ( I ) compound containing the Zn—Zn bond , ( η5-C5Me5 ) 2Zn2 , is also the first dimetallocene . The [ Zn2 ] 2+ ion rapidly disproportionates into zinc metal and zinc ( II ) , and has only been obtained as a yellow glass formed by cooling a solution of metallic zinc in molten ZnCl2 .
Some priests and former religious had already married , including Andreas Karlstadt and Justus Jonas , but Luther 's wedding set the seal of approval on clerical marriage . He had long condemned vows of celibacy on Biblical grounds , but his decision to marry surprised many , not least Melanchthon , who called it reckless . Luther had written to George Spalatin on 30 November 1524 , " I shall never take a wife , as I feel at present . Not that I am insensible to my flesh or sex ( for I am neither wood nor stone ) ; but my mind is averse to wedlock because I daily expect the death of a heretic . " Before marrying , Luther had been living on the plainest food , and , as he admitted himself , his mildewed bed was not properly made for months at a time .
Egypt also hosts an unknown number of refugees and asylum seekers , estimated to be between 500,000 and 3 million . There are some 70,000 Palestinian refugees , and about 150,000 recently arrived Iraqi refugees , but the number of the largest group , the Sudanese , is contested . [ nb 1 ] The once-vibrant and ancient Greek and Jewish communities in Egypt have almost disappeared , with only a small number remaining in the country , but many Egyptian Jews visit on religious or other occasions and tourism . Several important Jewish archaeological and historical sites are found in Cairo , Alexandria and other cities .
In his 1805 mandolin method , Anweisung die Mandoline von selbst zu erlernen nebst einigen Uebungsstucken von Bortolazzi , Bartolomeo Bortolazzi popularised the Cremonese mandolin , which had four single-strings and a fixed bridge , to which the strings were attached . Bortolazzi said in this book that the new wire strung mandolins were uncomfortable to play , when compared with the gut-string instruments . Also , he felt they had a " less pleasing ... hard , zither-like tone " as compared to the gut string 's " softer , full-singing tone . " He favored the four single strings of the Cremonese instrument , which were tuned the same as the Neapolitan .
Mandolin awareness in the United States blossomed in the 1880s , as the instrument became part of a fad that continued into the mid-1920s . According to Clarence L. Partee , the first mandolin made in the United States was made in 1883 or 1884 by Joseph Bohmann , who was an established maker of violins in Chicago . Partee characterized the early instrument as being larger than the European instruments he was used to , with a " peculiar shape " and " crude construction , " and said that the quality improved , until American instruments were " superior " to imported instruments . At the time , Partee was using an imported French-made mandolin .
Zinc is a chemical element with symbol Zn and atomic number 30 . It is the first element of group 12 of the periodic table . In some respects zinc is chemically similar to magnesium : its ion is of similar size and its only common oxidation state is +2 . Zinc is the 24th most abundant element in Earth 's crust and has five stable isotopes . The most common zinc ore is sphalerite ( zinc blende ) , a zinc sulfide mineral . The largest mineable amounts are found in Australia , Asia , and the United States . Zinc production includes froth flotation of the ore , roasting , and final extraction using electricity ( electrowinning ) .
On December 28 , 2015 , ESPN Deportes announced that they had reached an agreement with CBS and the NFL to be the exclusive Spanish-language broadcaster of the game , marking the third dedicated Spanish-language broadcast of the Super Bowl . Unlike NBC and Fox , CBS does not have a Spanish-language outlet of its own that could broadcast the game ( though per league policy , a separate Spanish play-by-play call was carried on CBS 's second audio program channel for over-the-air viewers ) . The game was called by ESPN Deportes ' Monday Night Football commentary crew of Alvaro Martin and Raul Allegre , and sideline reporter John Sutcliffe . ESPN Deportes broadcast pre-game and post-game coverage , while Martin , Allegre , and Sutcliffe contributed English-language reports for ESPN 's SportsCenter and Mike & Mike .
By that time , the majority of black people in the United States were native-born , so the use of the term " African " became problematic . Though initially a source of pride , many blacks feared that the use of African as an identity would be a hindrance to their fight for full citizenship in the US . They also felt that it would give ammunition to those who were advocating repatriating black people back to Africa . In 1835 , black leaders called upon Black Americans to remove the title of " African " from their institutions and replace it with " Negro " or " Colored American " . A few institutions chose to keep their historic names , such as the African Methodist Episcopal Church . African Americans popularly used the terms " Negro " or " colored " for themselves until the late 1960s .
BSkyB 's standard definition broadcasts are in DVB-compliant MPEG-2 , with the Sky Movies and Sky Box Office channels including optional Dolby Digital soundtracks for recent films , although these are only accessible with a Sky+ box . Sky+ HD material is broadcast using MPEG-4 and most of the HD material uses the DVB-S2 standard . Interactive services and 7-day EPG use the proprietary OpenTV system , with set-top boxes including modems for a return path . Sky News , amongst other channels , provides a pseudo-video on demand interactive service by broadcasting looping video streams .
Contemporary Eastern Orthodox Christians often object to the dogmatic declaration of her immaculate conception as an " over-elaboration " of the faith and because they see it as too closely connected with a particular interpretation of the doctrine of ancestral sin . All the same , the historical and authentic tradition of Mariology in Byzantium took its historical point of departure from Sophronios , Damascene , and their imitators . The most famous Eastern Orthodox theologian to imply Mary 's Immaculate Conception was St. Gregory Palamas . Though many passages from his works were long known to extol and attribute to Mary a Christlike holiness in her human nature , traditional objections to Palamas ' disposition toward the Immaculate Conception typically rely on a poor understanding of his doctrine of " the purification of Mary " at the Annunciation . Not only did he explicitly cite St. Gregory Nazianzen for his understanding of Jesus ' purification at His baptism and Mary 's at the Annunciation , but Theophanes of Nicaea , Joseph Bryennius , and Gennadios Scholarios all explicitly placed Mary 's Conception as the first moment of her all-immaculate participation in the divine energies to such a degree that she was always completely without spot and graced . In addition to Emperor Manuel II and Gennadius Scholarius , St. Mark of Ephesus also fervently defended Mary 's title as " prepurified " against the Dominican , Manuel Calecas , who was perhaps promoting thomistic Mariology that denied Mary 's all-holiness from the first moment of her existence .
At Maecenas ' insistence ( according to the tradition ) Virgil spent the ensuing years ( perhaps 37–29 BC ) on the long didactic hexameter poem called the Georgics ( from Greek , " On Working the Earth " ) which he dedicated to Maecenas . The ostensible theme of the Georgics is instruction in the methods of running a farm . In handling this theme , Virgil follows in the didactic ( " how to " ) tradition of the Greek poet Hesiod 's Works and Days and several works of the later Hellenistic poets . The four books of the Georgics focus respectively on raising crops and trees ( 1 and 2 ) , livestock and horses ( 3 ) , and beekeeping and the qualities of bees ( 4 ) . Well-known passages include the beloved Laus Italiae of Book 2 , the prologue description of the temple in Book 3 , and the description of the plague at the end of Book 3 . Book 4 concludes with a long mythological narrative , in the form of an epyllion which describes vividly the discovery of beekeeping by Aristaeus and the story of Orpheus ' journey to the underworld . Ancient scholars , such as Servius , conjectured that the Aristaeus episode replaced , at the emperor 's request , a long section in praise of Virgil 's friend , the poet Gallus , who was disgraced by Augustus , and who committed suicide in 26 BC .

Additionally , there are around 60,000 non-Jewish African immigrants in Israel , some of whom have sought asylum . Most of the migrants are from communities in Sudan and Eritrea , particularly the Niger-Congo-speaking Nuba groups of the southern Nuba Mountains ; some are illegal immigrants .
The U.S. census race definitions says a " black " is a person having origins in any of the black ( sub-Saharan ) racial groups of Africa . It includes people who indicate their race as " Black , African Am. , or Negro " or who provide written entries such as African American , Afro-American , Kenyan , Nigerian , or Haitian . The Census Bureau notes that these classifications are socio-political constructs and should not be interpreted as scientific or anthropological . Most African Americans also have European ancestry in varying amounts ; a lesser proportion have some Native American ancestry . For instance , genetic studies of African Americans show an ancestry that is on average 17–18 % European .

He enclosed in his letter a copy of his " Disputation of Martin Luther on the Power and Efficacy of Indulgences " , which came to be known as The Ninety-Five Theses . Hans Hillerbrand writes that Luther had no intention of confronting the church , but saw his disputation as a scholarly objection to church practices , and the tone of the writing is accordingly " searching , rather than doctrinaire . " Hillerbrand writes that there is nevertheless an undercurrent of challenge in several of the theses , particularly in Thesis 86 , which asks : " Why does the pope , whose wealth today is greater than the wealth of the richest Crassus , build the basilica of St. Peter with the money of poor believers rather than with his own money ? "
Manning finished the year with a career-low 67.9 passer rating , throwing for 2,249 yards and nine touchdowns , with 17 interceptions . In contrast , Osweiler threw for 1,967 yards , 10 touchdowns and six interceptions for a rating of 86.4 . Veteran receiver Demaryius Thomas led the team with 105 receptions for 1,304 yards and six touchdowns , while Emmanuel Sanders caught 76 passes for 1,135 yards and six scores , while adding another 106 yards returning punts . Tight end Owen Daniels was also a big element of the passing game with 46 receptions for 517 yards . Running back C. J. Anderson was the team 's leading rusher 863 yards and seven touchdowns , while also catching 25 passes for 183 yards . Running back Ronnie Hillman also made a big impact with 720 yards , five touchdowns , 24 receptions , and a 4.7 yards per carry average . Overall , the offense ranked 19th in scoring with 355 points and did not have any Pro Bowl selections .
Following a lengthy legal battle with the European Commission , which deemed the exclusivity of the rights to be against the interests of competition and the consumer , BSkyB 's monopoly came to an end from the 2007–08 season . In May 2006 , the Irish broadcaster Setanta Sports was awarded two of the six Premier League packages that the English FA offered to broadcasters . Sky picked up the remaining four for £1.3bn . In February 2015 , Sky bid £4.2bn for a package of 120 premier league games across the three seasons from 2016 . This represented an increase of 70 % on the previous contract and was said to be £1bn more than the company had expected to pay . The move has been followed by staff cuts , increased subscription prices ( including 9 % in Sky 's family package ) and the dropping of the 3D channel .
From outside the United Kingdom and the United States , the Canadian trio Rush released three distinctively hard rock albums in 1974–75 ( Rush , Fly by Night and Caress of Steel ) before moving toward a more progressive sound with the 1976 album 2112 . The Irish band Thin Lizzy , which had formed in the late 1960s , made their most substantial commercial breakthrough in 1976 with the hard rock album Jailbreak and their worldwide hit " The Boys Are Back in Town " , which reached number 8 in the UK and number 12 in the US . Their style , consisting of two duelling guitarists often playing leads in harmony , proved itself to be a large influence on later bands . They reached their commercial , and arguably their artistic peak with Black Rose : A Rock Legend ( 1979 ) . The arrival of Scorpions from Germany marked the geographical expansion of the subgenre . Australian-formed AC/DC , with a stripped back , riff heavy and abrasive style that also appealed to the punk generation , began to gain international attention from 1976 , culminating in the release of their multi-platinum albums Let There Be Rock ( 1977 ) and Highway to Hell ( 1979 ) . Also influenced by a punk ethos were heavy metal bands like Motörhead , while Judas Priest abandoned the remaining elements of the blues in their music , further differentiating the hard rock and heavy metal styles and helping to create the New Wave of British Heavy Metal which was pursued by bands like Iron Maiden , Saxon and Venom .
An apoplectic stroke deprived him of his speech , and he died shortly afterwards at 2:45 a.m. on 18 February 1546 , aged 62 , in Eisleben , the city of his birth . He was buried in the Castle Church in Wittenberg , beneath the pulpit . The funeral was held by his friends Johannes Bugenhagen and Philipp Melanchthon . A year later , troops of Luther 's adversary Charles V , Holy Roman Emperor entered the town , but were ordered by Charles not to disturb the grave .
From the 2000 census [ update ] , 60,455 or 47.0 % belonged to the Swiss Reformed Church , while 31,510 or 24.5 % were Roman Catholic . Of the rest of the population , there were 1,874 members of an Orthodox church ( or about 1.46 % of the population ) , there were 229 persons ( or about 0.18 % of the population ) who belonged to the Christian Catholic Church , and there were 5,531 persons ( or about 4.30 % of the population ) who belonged to another Christian church . There were 324 persons ( or about 0.25 % of the population ) who were Jewish , and 4,907 ( or about 3.81 % of the population ) who were Muslim . There were 629 persons who were Buddhist , 1,430 persons who were Hindu and 177 persons who belonged to another church . 16,363 ( or about 12.72 % of the population ) belonged to no church , are agnostic or atheist , and 7,855 persons ( or about 6.11 % of the population ) did not answer the question . On 14 December 2014 the Haus der Religionen was inaugurated .
He insisted that , since forgiveness was God 's alone to grant , those who claimed that indulgences absolved buyers from all punishments and granted them salvation were in error . Christians , he said , must not slacken in following Christ on account of such false assurances .
The Egyptians were one of the first major civilisations to codify design elements in art and architecture . Egyptian blue , also known as calcium copper silicate is a pigment used by Egyptians for thousands of years . It is considered to be the first synthetic pigment . The wall paintings done in the service of the Pharaohs followed a rigid code of visual rules and meanings . Egyptian civilisation is renowned for its colossal pyramids , temples and monumental tombs . Well-known examples are the Pyramid of Djoser designed by ancient architect and engineer Imhotep , the Sphinx , and the temple of Abu Simbel . Modern and contemporary Egyptian art can be as diverse as any works in the world art scene , from the vernacular architecture of Hassan Fathy and Ramses Wissa Wassef , to Mahmoud Mokhtar 's sculptures , to the distinctive Coptic iconography of Isaac Fanous . The Cairo Opera House serves as the main performing arts venue in the Egyptian capital .
This nationwide acceptance and recognition of Aboriginal people led to a significant increase in the number of people self-identifying as Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander . The reappropriation of the term " black " with a positive and more inclusive meaning has resulted in its widespread use in mainstream Australian culture , including public media outlets , government agencies , and private companies . In 2012 , a number of high-profile cases highlighted the legal and community attitude that identifying as Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander is not dependent on skin colour , with a well-known boxer Anthony Mundine being widely criticised for questioning the " blackness " of another boxer and journalist Andrew Bolt being successfully sued for publishing discriminatory comments about Aboriginals with light skin .
Bern has several dozen cinemas . As is customary in Switzerland , films are generally shown in their original language ( e.g. , English ) with German and French subtitles . Only a small number of screenings are dubbed in German .

The game 's media day , which was typically held on the Tuesday afternoon prior to the game , was moved to the Monday evening and re-branded as Super Bowl Opening Night . The event was held on February 1 , 2016 at SAP Center in San Jose . Alongside the traditional media availabilities , the event featured an opening ceremony with player introductions on a replica of the Golden Gate Bridge .
The Panthers seemed primed to score on their opening drive of the second half when Newton completed a 45-yard pass to Ted Ginn Jr. on the Denver 35-yard line on their second offensive play . But the Broncos defense halted the drive on the 26-yard line , and it ended with no points when Graham Gano hit the uprights on a 44-yard field goal attempt . After the miss , Manning completed a pair of passes to Emmanuel Sanders for gains of 25 and 22 yards , setting up McManus ' 33-yard field goal that gave the Broncos a 16–7 lead . Carolina got off to another strong start after the kickoff , with Newton completing a 42-yard pass to Corey Brown . But once again they came up empty , this time as a result of a Newton pass that bounced off the hands of Ginn and was intercepted by safety T. J . Ward . Ward fumbled the ball during the return , but Trevathan recovered it to enable Denver to keep possession .
Virgil is traditionally ranked as one of Rome 's greatest poets . His Aeneid has been considered the national epic of ancient Rome from the time of its composition to the present day . Modeled after Homer 's Iliad and Odyssey , the Aeneid follows the Trojan refugee Aeneas as he struggles to fulfill his destiny and arrive on the shores of Italy—in Roman mythology the founding act of Rome . Virgil 's work has had wide and deep influence on Western literature , most notably Dante 's Divine Comedy , in which Virgil appears as Dante 's guide through hell and purgatory .
Luther spoke out against the Jews in Saxony , Brandenburg , and Silesia . Josel of Rosheim , the Jewish spokesman who tried to help the Jews of Saxony in 1537 , later blamed their plight on " that priest whose name was Martin Luther—may his body and soul be bound up in hell ! —who wrote and issued many heretical books in which he said that whoever would help the Jews was doomed to perdition . " Josel asked the city of Strasbourg to forbid the sale of Luther 's anti-Jewish works : they refused initially , but did so when a Lutheran pastor in Hochfelden used a sermon to urge his parishioners to murder Jews . Luther 's influence persisted after his death . Throughout the 1580s , riots led to the expulsion of Jews from several German Lutheran states .
The merger made Columbia and Epic sister labels to RCA Records , which was once owned by RCA which also owned CBS rival NBC . It also started the process of bringing BMG 's Arista Records back under common ownership with its former parent Columbia Pictures , a Sony division since 1989 , and also brought Arista founder Clive Davis back into the fold . Davis is still with Sony Music as Chief Creative Officer .
In March 1968 , CBS and Sony formed CBS/Sony Records , a Japanese business joint venture . With Sony being one of the developers behind the compact disc digital music media , a compact disc production plant was constructed in Japan under the joint venture , allowing CBS to begin supplying some of the first compact disc releases for the American market in 1983 .
Luther taught that salvation and subsequently eternal life is not earned by good deeds but is received only as a free gift of God 's grace through faith in Jesus Christ as redeemer from sin . His theology challenged the authority and office of the Pope by teaching that the Bible is the only source of divinely revealed knowledge from God and opposed sacerdotalism by considering all baptized Christians to be a holy priesthood . Those who identify with these , and all of Luther 's wider teachings , are called Lutherans even though Luther insisted on Christian or Evangelical as the only acceptable names for individuals who professed Christ .
In January 2009 President Barack Obama restored US funding to UNFPA , saying in a public statement that he would " look forward to working with Congress to restore US financial support for the UN Population Fund . By resuming funding to UNFPA , the US will be joining 180 other donor nations working collaboratively to reduce poverty , improve the health of women and children , prevent HIV/AIDS and provide family planning assistance to women in 154 countries . "
Anthropologists have most frequently employed the term 'identity ' to refer to this idea of selfhood in a loosely Eriksonian way ( Erikson 1972 ) properties based on the uniqueness and individuality which makes a person distinct from others . Identity became of more interest to anthropologists with the emergence of modern concerns with ethnicity and social movements in the 1970s . This was reinforced by an appreciation , following the trend in sociological thought , of the manner in which the individual is affected by and contributes to the overall social context . At the same time , the Eriksonian approach to identity remained in force , with the result that identity has continued until recently to be used in a largely socio-historical way to refer to qualities of sameness in relation to a person 's connection to others and to a particular group of people .
The instrument was primarily used in an ensemble setting well into the 1930s , and although the fad died out at the beginning of the 1930s , the instruments that were developed for the orchestra found a new home in bluegrass . The famous Lloyd Loar Master Model from Gibson ( 1923 ) was designed to boost the flagging interest in mandolin ensembles , with little success . However , The " Loar " became the defining instrument of bluegrass music when Bill Monroe purchased F-5 S/N 73987 in a Florida barbershop in 1943 and popularized it as his main instrument .
The second decline was not as complete as the first . Thousands of people had learned to play the instrument . Even as the second wave of mandolin popularity declined in the early 20th century , new versions of the mandolin began to be used in new forms of music . Luthiers created the resonator mandolin , the flatback mandolin , the carved-top or arched-top mandolin , the mandolin-banjo and the electric mandolin . Musicians began playing it in Celtic , Bluegrass , Jazz and Rock-n-Roll styles — and Classical too .
He later attributed his decision to an event : on 2 July 1505 , he was returning to university on horseback after a trip home . During a thunderstorm , a lightning bolt struck near him . Later telling his father he was terrified of death and divine judgment , he cried out , " Help ! Saint Anna , I will become a monk ! " He came to view his cry for help as a vow he could never break . He left law school , sold his books , and entered a closed Augustinian cloister in Erfurt on 17 July 1505 . One friend blamed the decision on Luther 's sadness over the deaths of two friends . Luther himself seemed saddened by the move . Those who attended a farewell supper walked him to the door of the Black Cloister . " This day you see me , and then , not ever again , " he said . His father was furious over what he saw as a waste of Luther 's education .
Though Brazilians of at least partial African heritage make up a large percentage of the population , few blacks have been elected as politicians . The city of Salvador , Bahia , for instance , is 80 % people of color , but voters have not elected a mayor of color . Journalists like to say that US cities with black majorities , such as Detroit and New Orleans , have not elected white mayors since after the civil rights movement , when the Voting Rights Act of 1965 protected the franchise for minorities , and blacks in the South regained the power to vote for the first time since the turn of the 20th century . New Orleans elected its first black mayor in the 1970s . New Orleans elected a white mayor after the widescale disruption and damage of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 .
The biographical tradition asserts that Virgil began the hexameter Eclogues ( or Bucolics ) in 42 BC and it is thought that the collection was published around 39–38 BC , although this is controversial . The Eclogues ( from the Greek for " selections " ) are a group of ten poems roughly modeled on the bucolic hexameter poetry ( " pastoral poetry " ) of the Hellenistic poet Theocritus . After his victory in the Battle of Philippi in 42 BC , fought against the army led by the assassins of Julius Caesar , Octavian tried to pay off his veterans with land expropriated from towns in northern Italy , supposedly including , according to the tradition , an estate near Mantua belonging to Virgil . The loss of his family farm and the attempt through poetic petitions to regain his property have traditionally been seen as Virgil 's motives in the composition of the Eclogues . This is now thought to be an unsupported inference from interpretations of the Eclogues . In Eclogues 1 and 9 , Virgil indeed dramatizes the contrasting feelings caused by the brutality of the land expropriations through pastoral idiom , but offers no indisputable evidence of the supposed biographic incident . While some readers have identified the poet himself with various characters and their vicissitudes , whether gratitude by an old rustic to a new god ( Ecl . 1 ) , frustrated love by a rustic singer for a distant boy ( his master 's pet , Ecl . 2 ) , or a master singer 's claim to have composed several eclogues ( Ecl . 5 ) , modern scholars largely reject such efforts to garner biographical details from works of fiction , preferring to interpret an author 's characters and themes as illustrations of contemporary life and thought . The ten Eclogues present traditional pastoral themes with a fresh perspective . Eclogues 1 and 9 address the land confiscations and their effects on the Italian countryside . 2 and 3 are pastoral and erotic , discussing both homosexual love ( Ecl . 2 ) and attraction toward people of any gender ( Ecl . 3 ) . Eclogue 4 , addressed to Asinius Pollio , the so-called " Messianic Eclogue " uses the imagery of the golden age in connection with the birth of a child ( who the child was meant to be has been subject to debate ) . 5 and 8 describe the myth of Daphnis in a song contest , 6 , the cosmic and mythological song of Silenus ; 7 , a heated poetic contest , and 10 the sufferings of the contemporary elegiac poet Cornelius Gallus . Virgil is credited [ by whom ? ] in the Eclogues with establishing Arcadia as a poetic ideal that still resonates in Western literature and visual arts and setting the stage for the development of Latin pastoral by Calpurnius Siculus , Nemesianus , and later writers .
Early in 1537 , Johannes Agricola ( 1494–1566 ) – serving at the time as pastor in Luther 's birthplace , Eisleben – preached a sermon in which he claimed that God 's gospel , not God 's moral law ( the Ten Commandments ) , revealed God 's wrath to Christians . Based on this sermon and others by Agricola , Luther suspected that Agricola was behind certain anonymous antinomian theses circulating in Wittenberg . These theses asserted that the law is no longer to be taught to Christians but belonged only to city hall . Luther responded to these theses with six series of theses against Agricola and the antinomians , four of which became the basis for disputations between 1538 and 1540 . He also responded to these assertions in other writings , such as his 1539 open letter to C. Güttel Against the Antinomians , and his book On the Councils and the Church from the same year .
Although Egypt was a majority Christian country before the 7th Century , after Islam arrived , the country was slowly Islamified to become a majority Muslim country . Egypt emerged as a centre of politics and culture in the Muslim world . Under Anwar Sadat , Islam became the official state religion and Sharia the main source of law . It is estimated that 15 million Egyptians follow Native Sufi orders , with the Sufi leadership asserting that the numbers are much greater as many Egyptian Sufis are not officially registered with a Sufi order .
The catechism is one of Luther 's most personal works . " Regarding the plan to collect my writings in volumes , " he wrote , " I am quite cool and not at all eager about it because , roused by a Saturnian hunger , I would rather see them all devoured . For I acknowledge none of them to be really a book of mine , except perhaps the Bondage of the Will and the Catechism . " The Small Catechism has earned a reputation as a model of clear religious teaching . It remains in use today , along with Luther 's hymns and his translation of the Bible .
In 2008 [ update ] the total number of full-time equivalent jobs was 125,037 . The number of jobs in the primary sector was 203 , of which 184 were in agriculture and 19 were in forestry or lumber production . The number of jobs in the secondary sector was 15,476 of which 7,650 or ( 49.4 % ) were in manufacturing , 51 or ( 0.3 % ) were in mining and 6,389 ( 41.3 % ) were in construction . The number of jobs in the tertiary sector was 109,358 . In the tertiary sector ; 11,396 or 10.4 % were in wholesale or retail sales or the repair of motor vehicles , 10,293 or 9.4 % were in the movement and storage of goods , 5,090 or 4.7 % were in a hotel or restaurant , 7,302 or 6.7 % were in the information industry , 8,437 or 7.7 % were the insurance or financial industry , 10,660 or 9.7 % were technical professionals or scientists , 5,338 or 4.9 % were in education and 17,903 or 16.4 % were in health care .
These patterns of discrimination against non-whites have led some academic and other activists to advocate for use of the Portuguese term negro to encompass all African-descended people , in order to stimulate a " black " consciousness and identity . This proposal has been criticized since the term pardo is considered to include a wide range of multiracial people , such as caboclos ( mestizos ) , assimilated Amerindians and tri-racials , not only people of partial African and European descent . Trying to identify this entire group as " black " would be a false imposition of a different identity from outside the culture and deny people their other , equally valid , ancestries and cultures . It seems a one-drop rule in reverse .
Luther 's Commentary on Genesis contains a passage which concludes that " the soul does not sleep ( anima non sic dormit ) , but wakes ( sed vigilat ) and experiences visions " . Francis Blackburne in 1765 argued that John Jortin misread this and other passages from Luther , while Gottfried Fritschel pointed out in 1867 that it actually refers to the soul of a man " in this life " ( homo enim in hac vita ) tired from his daily labour ( defatigus diurno labore ) who at night enters his bedchamber ( sub noctem intrat in cubiculum suum ) and whose sleep is interrupted by dreams .
In the early 20th century several mandolin orchestras ( Estudiantinas ) were active in Belgium . Today only a few groups remain : Royal Estudiantina la Napolitaine ( founded in 1904 ) in Antwerp , Brasschaats mandoline orkest in Brasschaat and an orchestra in Mons ( Bergen ) . Gerda Abts is a well known mandolin virtuoso in Belgium . She is also mandolin teacher and gives lessons in the music academies of Lier , Wijnegem and Brasschaat . She is now also professor mandolin at the music high school “ Koninklijk Conservatorium Artesis Hogeschool Antwerpen ” . She also gives various concerts each year in different ensembles . She is in close contact to the Brasschaat mandolin Orchestra . Her site is www.gevoeligesnaar.be
A pair of overlapping political perspectives arising toward the end of the 20th century are republicanism ( or neo- or civic-republicanism ) and the capability approach . The resurgent republican movement aims to provide an alternate definition of liberty from Isaiah Berlin 's positive and negative forms of liberty , namely " liberty as non-domination . " Unlike liberals who understand liberty as " non-interference , " " non-domination " entails individuals not being subject to the arbitrary will of anyother person . To a liberal , a slave who is not interfered with may be free , yet to a republican the mere status as a slave , regardless of how that slave is treated , is objectionable . Prominent republicans include historian Quentin Skinner , jurist Cass Sunstein , and political philosopher Philip Pettit . The capability approach , pioneered by economists Mahbub ul Haq and Amartya Sen and further developed by legal scholar Martha Nussbaum , understands freedom under allied lines : the real-world ability to act . Both the capability approach and republicanism treat choice as something which must be resourced . In other words , it is not enough to be legally able to do something , but to have the real option of doing it .
The Siddi are an ethnic group inhabiting India and Pakistan whose members are descended from Bantu peoples from Southeast Africa that were brought to the Indian subcontinent as slaves by Arab and Portuguese merchants . Although it is commonly believed locally that " Siddi " derives from a word meaning " black " , the term is actually derived from " Sayyid " , the title borne by the captains of the Arab vessels that first brought Siddi settlers to the area . In the Makran strip of the Sindh and Balochistan provinces in southwestern Pakistan , these Bantu descendants are known as the Makrani . There was a brief " Black Power " movement in Sindh in the 1960s and many Siddi are proud of and celebrate their African ancestry .
Critics note that people of color have limited media visibility . The Brazilian media has been accused of hiding or overlooking the nation 's Black , Indigenous , Multiracial and East Asian populations . For example , the telenovelas or soaps are criticized for featuring actors who resemble northern Europeans rather than actors of the more prevalent Southern European features ) and light-skinned mulatto and mestizo appearance . ( Pardos may achieve " white " status if they have attained the middle-class or higher social status ) .
Luther 's 1538 hymnic version of the Lord 's Prayer , " Vater unser im Himmelreich " , corresponds exactly to Luther 's explanation of the prayer in the Small Catechism , with one stanza for each of the seven prayer petitions , plus opening and closing stanzas . The hymn functioned both as a liturgical setting of the Lord 's Prayer and as a means of examining candidates on specific catechism questions . The extant manuscript shows multiple revisions , demonstrating Luther 's concern to clarify and strengthen the text and to provide an appropriately prayerful tune . Other 16th- and 20th-century versifications of the Lord 's Prayer have adopted Luther 's tune , although modern texts are considerably shorter .
Luther 's hymns were frequently evoked by particular events in his life and the unfolding Reformation . This behavior started with his learning of the execution of Johann Esch and Heinrich Voes , the first individuals to be martyred by the Roman Catholic Church for Lutheran views , prompting Luther to write the hymn " Ein neues Lied wir heben an " ( " A new song we raise " ) , which is generally known in English by John C. Messenger 's translation by the title and first line " Flung to the Heedless Winds " and sung to the tune Ibstone composed in 1875 by Maria C. Tiddeman .
Popular opinion remained firmly behind the celebration of Mary 's conception . In 1439 , the Council of Basel , which is not reckoned an ecumenical council , stated that belief in the immaculate conception of Mary is in accord with the Catholic faith . By the end of the 15th century the belief was widely professed and taught in many theological faculties , but such was the influence of the Dominicans , and the weight of the arguments of Thomas Aquinas ( who had been canonised in 1323 and declared " Doctor Angelicus " of the Church in 1567 ) that the Council of Trent ( 1545–63 ) —which might have been expected to affirm the doctrine—instead declined to take a position .
Chinese political philosophy dates back to the Spring and Autumn Period , specifically with Confucius in the 6th century BC . Chinese political philosophy was developed as a response to the social and political breakdown of the country characteristic of the Spring and Autumn Period and the Warring States period . The major philosophies during the period , Confucianism , Legalism , Mohism , Agrarianism and Taoism , each had a political aspect to their philosophical schools . Philosophers such as Confucius , Mencius , and Mozi , focused on political unity and political stability as the basis of their political philosophies . Confucianism advocated a hierarchical , meritocratic government based on empathy , loyalty , and interpersonal relationships . Legalism advocated a highly authoritarian government based on draconian punishments and laws . Mohism advocated a communal , decentralized government centered on frugality and ascetism . The Agrarians advocated a peasant utopian communalism and egalitarianism . Taoism advocated a proto-anarchism . Legalism was the dominant political philosophy of the Qin Dynasty , but was replaced by State Confucianism in the Han Dynasty . Prior to China 's adoption of communism , State Confucianism remained the dominant political philosophy of China up to the 20th century .

In Latin , on the other hand , the [ First name ] Cardinal [ Surname ] order is used in the proclamation of the election of a new pope by the cardinal protodeacon : " Annuntio vobis gaudium magnum ; habemus Papam : Eminentissimum ac Reverendissimum Dominum , Dominum ( first name ) Sanctae Romanae Ecclesiae Cardinalem ( last name ) , ... " ( Meaning : " I announce to you a great joy ; we have a Pope : The Most Eminent and Most Reverend Lord , Lord ( first name ) Cardinal of the Holy Roman Church ( last name ) , ... " ) This assumes that the new pope had been a cardinal just before becoming pope ; the most recent election of a non-cardinal as pope was in 1378 .
The etymology of the name Bern is uncertain . According to the local legend , based on folk etymology , Berchtold V , Duke of Zähringen , the founder of the city of Bern , vowed to name the city after the first animal he met on the hunt , and this turned out to be a bear . It has long been considered likely that the city was named after the Italian city of Verona , which at the time was known as Bern in Middle High German . As a result of the find of the Bern zinc tablet in the 1980s , it is now more common to assume that the city was named after a pre-existing toponym of Celtic origin , possibly *berna " cleft " . The bear was the heraldic animal of the seal and coat of arms of Bern from at least the 1220s . The earliest reference to the keeping of live bears in the Bärengraben dates to the 1440s .
Rep. Christopher H. Smith ( R-NJ ) , criticized the State Department investigation , saying the investigators were shown " Potemkin Villages " where residents had been intimidated into lying about the family-planning program . Dr. Nafis Sadik , former director of UNFPA said her agency had been pivotal in reversing China 's coercive population control methods , but a 2005 report by Amnesty International and a separate report by the United States State Department found that coercive techniques were still regularly employed by the Chinese , casting doubt upon Sadik 's statements .
President Bush denied funding to the UNFPA . Over the course of the Bush Administration , a total of $ 244 million in Congressionally approved funding was blocked by the Executive Branch .
Westwood One will carry the game throughout North America , with Kevin Harlan as play-by-play announcer , Boomer Esiason and Dan Fouts as color analysts , and James Lofton and Mark Malone as sideline reporters . Jim Gray will anchor the pre-game and halftime coverage .
Brass , which is an alloy of copper and zinc , has been used since at least the 10th century BC in Judea and by the 7th century BC in Ancient Greece . Zinc metal was not produced on a large scale until the 12th century in India and was unknown to Europe until the end of the 16th century . The mines of Rajasthan have given definite evidence of zinc production going back to the 6th century BC . To date , the oldest evidence of pure zinc comes from Zawar , in Rajasthan , as early as the 9th century AD when a distillation process was employed to make pure zinc . Alchemists burned zinc in air to form what they called " philosopher 's wool " or " white snow " .
The city of Bern or Berne ( German : Bern , pronounced [ bɛrn ] ( listen ) ; French : Berne [ bɛʁn ] ; Italian : Berna [ ˈbɛrna ] ; Romansh : Berna [ ˈbɛrnɐ ] ( help·info ) ; Bernese German : Bärn [ b̥æːrn ] ) is the de facto capital of Switzerland , referred to by the Swiss as their ( e.g . in German ) Bundesstadt , or " federal city " . [ note 1 ] With a population of 140,634 ( November 2015 ) , Bern is the fifth most populous city in Switzerland . The Bern agglomeration , which includes 36 municipalities , had a population of 406,900 in 2014 . The metropolitan area had a population of 660,000 in 2000 . Bern is also the capital of the Canton of Bern , the second most populous of Switzerland 's cantons .
Zinc serves a purely structural role in zinc fingers , twists and clusters . Zinc fingers form parts of some transcription factors , which are proteins that recognize DNA base sequences during the replication and transcription of DNA . Each of the nine or ten Zn2+ ions in a zinc finger helps maintain the finger 's structure by coordinately binding to four amino acids in the transcription factor . The transcription factor wraps around the DNA helix and uses its fingers to accurately bind to the DNA sequence .

In addition to the Vince Lombardi Trophy that all Super Bowl champions receive , the winner of Super Bowl 50 will also receive a large , 18-karat gold-plated " 50 " . Each digit will weigh 33 lb ( 15 kg ) for a total of 66 lb ( 30 kg ) . Like the Lombardi Trophy , the " 50 " will be designed by Tiffany & Co .
This was the first Super Bowl to feature a quarterback on both teams who was the # 1 pick in their draft classes . Manning was the # 1 selection of the 1998 NFL draft , while Newton was picked first in 2011 . The matchup also pits the top two picks of the 2011 draft against each other : Newton for Carolina and Von Miller for Denver . Manning and Newton also set the record for the largest age difference between opposing Super Bowl quarterbacks at 13 years and 48 days ( Manning was 39 , Newton was 26 ) .
On December 28 , 2015 , ESPN Deportes announced that they had reached an agreement with CBS and the NFL to be the exclusive Spanish-language broadcaster of the game , marking the third dedicated Spanish-language broadcast of the Super Bowl . Unlike NBC and Fox , CBS does not have a Spanish-language outlet of its own that could broadcast the game ( though per league policy , a separate Spanish play-by-play call was carried on CBS 's second audio program channel for over-the-air viewers ) . The game was called by ESPN Deportes ' Monday Night Football commentary crew of Alvaro Martin and Raul Allegre , and sideline reporter John Sutcliffe . ESPN Deportes broadcast pre-game and post-game coverage , while Martin , Allegre , and Sutcliffe contributed English-language reports for ESPN 's SportsCenter and Mike & Mike .
Communism remained an important focus especially during the 1950s and 1960s . Colonialism and racism were important issues that arose . In general , there was a marked trend towards a pragmatic approach to political issues , rather than a philosophical one . Much academic debate regarded one or both of two pragmatic topics : how ( or whether ) to apply utilitarianism to problems of political policy , or how ( or whether ) to apply economic models ( such as rational choice theory ) to political issues . The rise of feminism , LGBT social movements and the end of colonial rule and of the political exclusion of such minorities as African Americans and sexual minorities in the developed world has led to feminist , postcolonial , and multicultural thought becoming significant . This led to a challenge to the social contract by philosophers Charles W. Mills in his book The Racial Contract and Carole Patemen in her book The Sexual Contract that the social contract excluded persons of colour and women respectively .
While the incumbents of some sees are regularly made cardinals , and some countries are entitled to at least one cardinal by concordate ( usually earning its primate the cardinal 's hat ) , no see carries an actual right to the cardinalate , not even if its bishop is a Patriarch .
Numerous communities of dark-skinned peoples are present in North Africa , some dating from prehistoric communities . Others are descendants of the historical Trans-Saharan trade in peoples and/or , and after the Arab invasions of North Africa in the 7th century , descendants of slaves from the Arab Slave Trade in North Africa .
The Panthers offense , which led the NFL in scoring ( 500 points ) , was loaded with talent , boasting six Pro Bowl selections . Pro Bowl quarterback Cam Newton had one of his best seasons , throwing for 3,837 yards and rushing for 636 , while recording a career-high and league-leading 45 total touchdowns ( 35 passing , 10 rushing ) , a career-low 10 interceptions , and a career-best quarterback rating of 99.4 . Newton 's leading receivers were tight end Greg Olsen , who caught a career-high 77 passes for 1,104 yards and seven touchdowns , and wide receiver Ted Ginn , Jr. , who caught 44 passes for 739 yards and 10 touchdowns ; Ginn also rushed for 60 yards and returned 27 punts for 277 yards . Other key receivers included veteran Jerricho Cotchery ( 39 receptions for 485 yards ) , rookie Devin Funchess ( 31 receptions for 473 yards and five touchdowns ) , and second-year receiver Corey Brown ( 31 receptions for 447 yards ) . The Panthers backfield featured Pro Bowl running back Jonathan Stewart , who led the team with 989 rushing yards and six touchdowns in 13 games , along with Pro Bowl fullback Mike Tolbert , who rushed for 256 yards and caught 18 passes for another 154 yards . Carolina 's offensive line also featured two Pro Bowl selections : center Ryan Kalil and guard Trai Turner .
Zinc is a chemical element with symbol Zn and atomic number 30 . It is the first element of group 12 of the periodic table . In some respects zinc is chemically similar to magnesium : its ion is of similar size and its only common oxidation state is +2 . Zinc is the 24th most abundant element in Earth 's crust and has five stable isotopes . The most common zinc ore is sphalerite ( zinc blende ) , a zinc sulfide mineral . The largest mineable amounts are found in Australia , Asia , and the United States . Zinc production includes froth flotation of the ore , roasting , and final extraction using electricity ( electrowinning ) .
A person may display either relative weakness or relative strength in terms of both exploration and commitments . When assigned categories , four possible permutations result : identity diffusion , identity foreclosure , identity moratorium , and identity achievement . Diffusion is when a person lacks both exploration in life and interest in committing even to those unchosen roles that he or she occupies . Foreclosure is when a person has not chosen extensively in the past , but seems willing to commit to some relevant values , goals , or roles in the future . Moratorium is when a person displays a kind of flightiness , ready to make choices but unable to commit to them . Finally , achievement is when a person makes identity choices and commits to them .
CBS provided digital streams of the game via CBSSports.com , and the CBS Sports apps on tablets , Windows 10 , Xbox One and other digital media players ( such as Chromecast and Roku ) . Due to Verizon Communications exclusivity , streaming on smartphones was only provided to Verizon Wireless customers via the NFL Mobile service . The ESPN Deportes Spanish broadcast was made available through WatchESPN .
In 1958 , Egypt and Syria formed a sovereign union known as the United Arab Republic . The union was short-lived , ending in 1961 when Syria seceded , thus ending the union . During most of its existence , the United Arab Republic was also in a loose confederation with North Yemen ( or the Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen ) , known as the United Arab States . In 1959 , the All-Palestine Government of the Gaza Strip , an Egyptian client state , was absorbed into the United Arab Republic under the pretext of Arab union , and was never restored .
Due to the Ottoman slave trade that had flourished in the Balkans , the coastal town of Ulcinj in Montenegro had its own black community . As a consequence of the slave trade and privateer activity , it is told how until 1878 in Ulcinj 100 black people lived . The Ottoman Army also deployed an estimated 30,000 Black African troops and cavalrymen to its expedition in Hungary during the Austro-Turkish War of 1716–18 .
Virgin Media ( re-branded in 2007 from NTL : Telewest ) started to offer a high-definition television ( HDTV ) capable set top box , although from 30 November 2006 until 30 July 2009 it only carried one linear HD channel , BBC HD , after the conclusion of the ITV HD trial . Virgin Media has claimed that other HD channels were " locked up " or otherwise withheld from their platform , although Virgin Media did in fact have an option to carry Channel 4 HD in the future . Nonetheless , the linear channels were not offered , Virgin Media instead concentrating on its Video On Demand service to carry a modest selection of HD content . Virgin Media has nevertheless made a number of statements over the years , suggesting that more linear HD channels are on the way .
The game 's media day , which was typically held on the Tuesday afternoon prior to the game , was moved to the Monday evening and re-branded as Super Bowl Opening Night . The event was held on February 1 , 2016 at SAP Center in San Jose . Alongside the traditional media availabilities , the event featured an opening ceremony with player introductions on a replica of the Golden Gate Bridge .

Following the 1973 war and the subsequent peace treaty , Egypt became the first Arab nation to establish diplomatic relations with Israel . Despite that , Israel is still widely considered as a hostile state by the majority of Egyptians . Egypt has played a historical role as a mediator in resolving various disputes in the Middle East , most notably its handling of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the peace process . Egypt 's ceasefire and truce brokering efforts in Gaza have hardly been challenged following Israel 's evacuation of its settlements from the strip in 2005 , despite increasing animosity towards the Hamas government in Gaza following the ouster of Mohamed Morsi , and despite recent attempts by countries like Turkey and Qatar to take over this role .
According to Dr. Carlos Moore , resident scholar at Brazil 's University of the State of Bahia , in the 21st century Afro-multiracials in the Arab world , including Arabs in North Africa , self-identify in ways that resemble multi-racials in Latin America . He claims that black-looking Arabs , much like black-looking Latin Americans , consider themselves white because they have some distant white ancestry .

Although not yet tested as a therapy in humans , a growing body of evidence indicates that zinc may preferentially kill prostate cancer cells . Because zinc naturally homes to the prostate and because the prostate is accessible with relatively non-invasive procedures , its potential as a chemotherapeutic agent in this type of cancer has shown promise . However , other studies have demonstrated that chronic use of zinc supplements in excess of the recommended dosage may actually increase the chance of developing prostate cancer , also likely due to the natural buildup of this heavy metal in the prostate .
Rep. Christopher H. Smith ( R-NJ ) , criticized the State Department investigation , saying the investigators were shown " Potemkin Villages " where residents had been intimidated into lying about the family-planning program . Dr. Nafis Sadik , former director of UNFPA said her agency had been pivotal in reversing China 's coercive population control methods , but a 2005 report by Amnesty International and a separate report by the United States State Department found that coercive techniques were still regularly employed by the Chinese , casting doubt upon Sadik 's statements .
In addition , there are $ 2 million worth of other ancillary events , including a week-long event at the Santa Clara Convention Center , a beer , wine and food festival at Bellomy Field at Santa Clara University , and a pep rally . A professional fundraiser will aid in finding business sponsors and individual donors , but still may need the city council to help fund the event . Additional funding will be provided by the city council , which has announced plans to set aside seed funding for the event .
On the other hand , Luther also points out that the Ten Commandments – when considered not as God 's condemning judgment but as an expression of his eternal will , that is , of the natural law – also positively teach how the Christian ought to live . This has traditionally been called the " third use of the law . " For Luther , also Christ 's life , when understood as an example , is nothing more than an illustration of the Ten Commandments , which a Christian should follow in his or her vocations on a daily basis .
After each team punted , Panthers quarterback Cam Newton appeared to complete a 24-yard pass Jerricho Cotchery , but the call was ruled an incompletion and upheld after a replay challenge . CBS analyst and retired referee Mike Carey stated he disagreed with the call and felt the review clearly showed the pass was complete . A few plays later , on 3rd-and-10 from the 15-yard line , linebacker Von Miller knocked the ball out of Newton 's hands while sacking him , and Malik Jackson recovered it in the end zone for a Broncos touchdown , giving the team a 10–0 lead . This was the first fumble return touchdown in a Super Bowl since Super Bowl XXVIII at the end of the 1993 season .
By the 2000 census , demographic changes including the end to slavery , immigration from Europe and Asia , assimilation of multiracial persons , and other factors resulted in a population in which 6.2 % of the population identified as black , 40 % as pardo , and 55 % as white . Essentially most of the black population was absorbed into the multi-racial category by intermixing . A 2007 genetic study found that at least 29 % of the middle-class , white Brazilian population had some recent ( since 1822 and the end of the colonial period ) African ancestry .
UNFPA has been falsely accused by anti-family planning groups of providing support for government programs which have promoted forced-abortions and coercive sterilizations . Controversies regarding these claims have resulted in a sometimes shaky relationship between the organization and three presidential administrations , that of Ronald Reagan , George H. W. Bush and George W. Bush , withholding funding from the UNFPA .
World War I was a watershed event in human history , changing views of governments and politics . The Russian Revolution of 1917 ( and similar , albeit less successful , revolutions in many other European countries ) brought communism - and in particular the political theory of Leninism , but also on a smaller level Luxemburgism ( gradually ) - on the world stage . At the same time , social democratic parties won elections and formed governments for the first time , often as a result of the introduction of universal suffrage . However , a group of central European economists led by Austrian School economists Ludwig von Mises and Friedrich Hayek identified the collectivist underpinnings to the various new socialist and fascist doctrines of government power as being different brands of political totalitarianism .
At the heart of scholars ' debate about Luther 's influence is whether it is anachronistic to view his work as a precursor of the racial antisemitism of the Nazis . Some scholars see Luther 's influence as limited , and the Nazis ' use of his work as opportunistic . Biographer Martin Brecht points out that " There is a world of difference between his belief in salvation and a racial ideology . Nevertheless , his misguided agitation had the evil result that Luther fatefully became one of the 'church fathers ' of anti-Semitism and thus provided material for the modern hatred of the Jews , cloaking it with the authority of the Reformer . " Johannes Wallmann argues that Luther 's writings against the Jews were largely ignored in the 18th and 19th centuries , and that there was no continuity between Luther 's thought and Nazi ideology . Uwe Siemon-Netto agreed , arguing that it was because the Nazis were already anti-Semites that they revived Luther 's work . Hans J. Hillerbrand agreed that to focus on Luther was to adopt an essentially ahistorical perspective of Nazi antisemitism that ignored other contributory factors in German history . Similarly , Roland Bainton , noted church historian and Luther biographer , wrote " One could wish that Luther had died before ever [ On the Jews and Their Lies ] was written . His position was entirely religious and in no respect racial . "
Some scholars have asserted that Luther taught that faith and reason were antithetical in the sense that questions of faith could not be illuminated by reason . He wrote , " All the articles of our Christian faith , which God has revealed to us in His Word , are in presence of reason sheerly impossible , absurd , and false . " and " [ That ] Reason in no way contributes to faith . [ ... ] For reason is the greatest enemy that faith has ; it never comes to the aid of spiritual things . " However , though seemingly contradictorily , he also wrote in the latter work that human reason " strives not against faith , when enlightened , but rather furthers and advances it " , bringing claims he was a fideist into dispute . Contemporary Lutheran scholarship , however , has found a different reality in Luther . Luther rather seeks to separate faith and reason in order to honor the separate spheres of knowledge that each applies to . Bernhard Lohse , for example , has demonstrated in his classic work " Fides und Ratio " that Luther ultimately sought to put the two together . More recently , Hans-Peter Grosshans has demonstrated that Luther 's work on Biblical Criticism stresses the need for external coherence in the right exegetical method . This means that for Luther it is more important that the Bible is reasonable according to the reality outside of the scriptures than that the Bible makes sense to itself , that it has internal coherence . The right tool for understanding the world outside of the Bible for Luther is none other than reason , which for him is the field of science , philosophy , history and empirical observation . Here a different picture is presented of a Luther who deeply valued both faith and reason , and held them in dialectical partnership . Luther 's concern thus in separating them is honoring their different epistemological spheres .
Contributions from governments and the private sector to UNFPA in 2014 exceeded $ 1 billion . The amount includes $ 477 million to the organization ’ s core resources and $ 529 million earmarked for specific programs and initiatives .
In 2004 , SME and Bertelsmann Music Group merged as Sony BMG Music Entertainment . When Sony acquired BMG 's half of the conglomerate in 2008 , Sony BMG reverted to the SME name . The buyout led to the dissolution of BMG , which then relaunched as BMG Rights Management . Out of the " Big Three " record companies , with Universal Music Group being the largest and Warner Music Group , SME is middle-sized .
Egypt has a developed energy market based on coal , oil , natural gas , and hydro power . Substantial coal deposits in the northeast Sinai are mined at the rate of about 600,000 tonnes ( 590,000 long tons ; 660,000 short tons ) per year . Oil and gas are produced in the western desert regions , the Gulf of Suez , and the Nile Delta . Egypt has huge reserves of gas , estimated at 2,180 cubic kilometres ( 520 cu mi ) , and LNG up to 2012 exported to many countries . In 2013 , the Egyptian General Petroleum Co ( EGPC ) said the country will cut exports of natural gas and tell major industries to slow output this summer to avoid an energy crisis and stave off political unrest , Reuters has reported . Egypt is counting on top liquid natural gas ( LNG ) exporter Qatar to obtain additional gas volumes in summer , while encouraging factories to plan their annual maintenance for those months of peak demand , said EGPC chairman , Tarek El Barkatawy . Egypt produces its own energy , but has been a net oil importer since 2008 and is rapidly becoming a net importer of natural gas .

When in choir dress , a Latin-rite cardinal wears scarlet garments — the blood-like red symbolizes a cardinal 's willingness to die for his faith . Excluding the rochet — which is always white — the scarlet garments include the cassock , mozzetta , and biretta ( over the usual scarlet zucchetto ) . The biretta of a cardinal is distinctive not merely for its scarlet color , but also for the fact that it does not have a pompon or tassel on the top as do the birettas of other prelates . Until the 1460s , it was customary for cardinals to wear a violet or blue cape unless granted the privilege of wearing red when acting on papal business . His normal-wear cassock is black but has scarlet piping and a scarlet fascia ( sash ) . Occasionally , a cardinal wears a scarlet ferraiolo which is a cape worn over the shoulders , tied at the neck in a bow by narrow strips of cloth in the front , without any 'trim ' or piping on it . It is because of the scarlet color of cardinals ' vesture that the bird of the same name has become known as such . [ citation needed ]
In 1982 , the US Mint began minting pennies coated in copper but made primarily of zinc . With the new zinc pennies , there is the potential for zinc toxicosis , which can be fatal . One reported case of chronic ingestion of 425 pennies ( over 1 kg of zinc ) resulted in death due to gastrointestinal bacterial and fungal sepsis , whereas another patient , who ingested 12 grams of zinc , only showed lethargy and ataxia ( gross lack of coordination of muscle movements ) . Several other cases have been reported of humans suffering zinc intoxication by the ingestion of zinc coins .
In the United States , the game was televised by CBS , as part of a cycle between the three main broadcast television partners of the NFL . The network 's lead broadcast team of Jim Nantz and Phil Simms called the contest , with Tracy Wolfson and Evan Washburn on the sidelines . CBS introduced new features during the telecast , including pylon cameras and microphones along with EyeVision 360—an array of 36 cameras along the upper deck that can be used to provide a 360-degree view of plays and " bullet time " effects . ( An earlier version of EyeVision was last used in Super Bowl XXXV ; for Super Bowl 50 , the cameras were upgraded to 5K resolution . )
From the years 1500 to 1850 , an estimated 3.5 million captives were forcibly shipped from West/Central Africa to Brazil ; the territory received the highest number of slaves of any country in the Americas . Scholars estimate that more than half of the Brazilian population is at least in part descended from these individuals . Brazil has the largest population of Afro-descendants outside of Africa . In contrast to the US , during the slavery period and after , the Portuguese colonial government and later Brazilian government did not pass formal anti-miscegenation or segregation laws . As in other Latin countries , intermarriage was prevalent during the colonial period and continued afterward . In addition , people of mixed race ( pardo ) often tended to marry white , and their descendants became accepted as white . As a result , some of the European descended population also has West African or Amerindian blood . According to the last census of the 20th century , in which Brazilians could choose from five color/ethnic categories with which they identified , 54 % of individuals identified as white , 6.2 % identified as black , and 39.5 % identified as pardo ( brown ) — a broad multi-racial category , including tri-racial persons .
When Sky Digital was launched in 1998 the new service used the Astra 2A satellite which was located at the 28.5°E orbital position , unlike the analogue service which was broadcast from 19.2°E . This was subsequently followed by more Astra satellites as well as Eutelsat 's Eurobird 1 ( now Eutelsat 33C ) at 28.5°E ) , enabled the company to launch a new all-digital service , Sky , with the potential to carry hundreds of television and radio channels . The old position was shared with broadcasters from several European countries , while the new position at 28.5°E came to be used almost exclusively for channels that broadcast to the United Kingdom .
In cities other than Rome , the name cardinal began to be applied to certain church men as a mark of honour . The earliest example of this occurs in a letter sent by Pope Zacharias in 747 to Pippin III ( the Short ) , ruler of the Franks , in which Zacharias applied the title to the priests of Paris to distinguish them from country clergy . This meaning of the word spread rapidly , and from the 9th century various episcopal cities had a special class among the clergy known as cardinals . The use of the title was reserved for the cardinals of Rome in 1567 by Pius V .
The Romans interacted with and later conquered parts of Mauretania , an early state that covered modern Morocco , western Algeria , and the Spanish cities Ceuta and Melilla during the classical period . The people of the region were noted in Classical literature as Mauri , which was subsequently rendered as Moors in English .
Luther is honoured on 18 February with a commemoration in the Lutheran Calendar of Saints and in the Episcopal ( United States ) Calendar of Saints . In the Church of England 's Calendar of Saints he is commemorated on 31 October .
The Panthers defense gave up just 308 points , ranking sixth in the league , while also leading the NFL in interceptions with 24 and boasting four Pro Bowl selections . Pro Bowl defensive tackle Kawann Short led the team in sacks with 11 , while also forcing three fumbles and recovering two . Fellow lineman Mario Addison added 6½ sacks . The Panthers line also featured veteran defensive end Jared Allen , a 5-time pro bowler who was the NFL 's active career sack leader with 136 , along with defensive end Kony Ealy , who had 5 sacks in just 9 starts . Behind them , two of the Panthers three starting linebackers were also selected to play in the Pro Bowl : Thomas Davis and Luke Kuechly . Davis compiled 5½ sacks , four forced fumbles , and four interceptions , while Kuechly led the team in tackles ( 118 ) forced two fumbles , and intercepted four passes of his own . Carolina 's secondary featured Pro Bowl safety Kurt Coleman , who led the team with a career high seven interceptions , while also racking up 88 tackles and Pro Bowl cornerback Josh Norman , who developed into a shutdown corner during the season and had four interceptions , two of which were returned for touchdowns .
Egypt has one of the oldest civilisations in the world . It has been in contact with many other civilisations and nations and has been through so many eras , starting from prehistoric age to the modern age , passing through so many ages such as ; Pharonic , Roman , Greek , Islamic and many other ages . Because of this wide variation of ages , the continuous contact with other nations and the big number of conflicts Egypt had been through , at least 60 museums may be found in Egypt , mainly covering a wide area of these ages and conflicts .
Nearly two billion people in the developing world are deficient in zinc . In children it causes an increase in infection and diarrhea , contributing to the death of about 800,000 children worldwide per year . The World Health Organization advocates zinc supplementation for severe malnutrition and diarrhea . Zinc supplements help prevent disease and reduce mortality , especially among children with low birth weight or stunted growth . However , zinc supplements should not be administered alone , because many in the developing world have several deficiencies , and zinc interacts with other micronutrients .
The mandolin has been used occasionally in rock music , first appearing in the psychedelic era of the late 1960s . Levon Helm of The Band occasionally moved from his drum kit to play mandolin , most notably on Rag Mama Rag , Rockin ' Chair , and Evangeline . Ian Anderson of Jethro Tull played mandolin on Fat Man , from their second album , Stand Up , and also occasionally on later releases . Rod Stewart 's 1971 No . 1 hit Maggie May features a significant mandolin riff . David Grisman played mandolin on two Grateful Dead songs on the American Beauty album , Friend of the Devil and Ripple , which became instant favorites among amateur pickers at jam sessions and campground gatherings . John Paul Jones and Jimmy Page both played mandolin on Led Zeppelin songs . The popular alt rock group Imagine Dragons feature the mandolin on a few of their songs , most prominently being It 's Time . Dash Crofts of the soft rock duo Seals and Crofts extensively used mandolin in their repertoire during the 1970s . Styx released the song Boat on the River in 1980 , which featured Tommy Shaw on vocals and mandolin . The song did n't chart in the United States but was popular in much of Europe and the Philippines .
Without Luther 's backing for the uprising , many rebels laid down their weapons ; others felt betrayed . Their defeat by the Swabian League at the Battle of Frankenhausen on 15 May 1525 , followed by Müntzer 's execution , brought the revolutionary stage of the Reformation to a close . Thereafter , radicalism found a refuge in the anabaptist movement and other religious movements , while Luther 's Reformation flourished under the wing of the secular powers .
The city grew out towards the west of the boundaries of the peninsula formed by the River Aare . The Zytglogge tower marked the western boundary of the city from 1191 until 1256 , when the Käfigturm took over this role until 1345 . It was , in turn , succeeded by the Christoffelturm ( formerly located close to the site of the modern-day railway station ) until 1622 . During the time of the Thirty Years ' War , two new fortifications – the so-called big and small Schanze ( entrenchment ) – were built to protect the whole area of the peninsula .
Economic conditions have started to improve considerably , after a period of stagnation , due to the adoption of more liberal economic policies by the government as well as increased revenues from tourism and a booming stock market . In its annual report , the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) has rated Egypt as one of the top countries in the world undertaking economic reforms . Some major economic reforms undertaken by the government since 2003 include a dramatic slashing of customs and tariffs . A new taxation law implemented in 2005 decreased corporate taxes from 40 % to the current 20 % , resulting in a stated 100 % increase in tax revenue by the year 2006 .
About 150,000 East African and black people live in Israel , amounting to just over 2 % of the nation 's population . The vast majority of these , some 120,000 , are Beta Israel , most of whom are recent immigrants who came during the 1980s and 1990s from Ethiopia . In addition , Israel is home to over 5,000 members of the African Hebrew Israelites of Jerusalem movement that are descendants of African Americans who emigrated to Israel in the 20th century , and who reside mainly in a distinct neighborhood in the Negev town of Dimona . Unknown numbers of black converts to Judaism reside in Israel , most of them converts from the United Kingdom , Canada , and the United States .
President Bush denied funding to the UNFPA . Over the course of the Bush Administration , a total of $ 244 million in Congressionally approved funding was blocked by the Executive Branch .
Beginning several centuries ago , during the period of the Ottoman Empire , tens of thousands of Black Africans were brought by slave traders to plantations and agricultural areas situated between Antalya and Istanbul in present-day Turkey . Some of their descendants remained in situ , and many migrated to larger cities and towns . Other blacks slaves were transported to Crete , from where they or their descendants later reached the İzmir area through the population exchange between Greece and Turkey in 1923 , or indirectly from Ayvalık in pursuit of work .
Further claims were made that the Roman Catholic Church derives its doctrine from the Islamic teaching . In volume 5 of his Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire , published in 1788 , Edward Gibbon wrote : " The Latin Church has not disdained to borrow from the Koran the immaculate conception of his virgin mother . " That he was speaking of her immaculate conception by her mother , not of her own virginal conception of Jesus , is shown by his footnote : " In the xiith century the immaculate conception was condemned by St. Bernard as a presumptuous novelty . " In the aftermath of the definition of the dogma in 1854 , this charge was repeated : " Strange as it may appear , that the doctrine which the church of Rome has promulgated , with so much pomp and ceremony , 'for the destruction of all heresies , and the confirmation of the faith of her adherents ' , should have its origin in the Mohametan Bible ; yet the testimony of such authorities as Gibbon , and Sale , and Forster , and Gagnier , and Maracci , leave no doubt as to the marvellous fact . "
CBS set the base rate for a 30-second advertisement at $ 5,000,000 , a record high price for a Super Bowl ad . As of January 26 , the advertisements had not yet sold out . CBS mandated that all advertisers purchase a package covering time on both the television and digital broadcasts of the game , meaning that for the first time , digital streams of the game would carry all national advertising in pattern with the television broadcast . This would be the final year in a multi-year contract with Anheuser-Busch InBev that allowed the beer manufacturer to air multiple advertisements during the game at a steep discount . It was also the final year that Doritos , a longtime sponsor of the game , held its " Crash the Super Bowl " contest that allowed viewers to create their own Doritos ads for a chance to have it aired during the game . Nintendo and The Pokémon Company also made their Super Bowl debut , promoting the 20th anniversary of the Pokémon video game and media franchise .
The defined dogma of the Immaculate Conception regards original sin only , saying that Mary was preserved from any stain ( in Latin , macula or labes , the second of these two synonymous words being the one used in the formal definition ) . The proclaimed Roman Catholic dogma states " that the most Blessed Virgin Mary , in the first instance of her conception , by a singular grace and privilege granted by Almighty God , in view of the merits of Jesus Christ , the Saviour of the human race , was preserved free from all stain of original sin . " Therefore , being always free from original sin , the doctrine teaches that from her conception Mary received the sanctifying grace that would normally come with baptism after birth .
As the designated home team in the annual rotation between AFC and NFC teams , the Broncos elected to wear their road white jerseys with matching white pants . Elway stated , " We 've had Super Bowl success in our white uniforms . " The Broncos last wore matching white jerseys and pants in the Super Bowl in Super Bowl XXXIII , Elway 's last game as Denver QB , when they defeated the Atlanta Falcons 34–19 . In their only other Super Bowl win in Super Bowl XXXII , Denver wore blue jerseys , which was their primary color at the time . They also lost Super Bowl XXI when they wore white jerseys , but they are 0-4 in Super Bowls when wearing orange jerseys , losing in Super Bowl XII , XXII , XXIV , and XLVIII . The only other AFC champion team to have worn white as the designated home team in the Super Bowl was the Pittsburgh Steelers ; they defeated the Seattle Seahawks 21–10 in Super Bowl XL 10 seasons prior . The Broncos ' decision to wear white meant the Panthers would wear their standard home uniform : black jerseys with silver pants .
Bern was occupied by French troops in 1798 during the French Revolutionary Wars , when it was stripped of parts of its territories . It regained control of the Bernese Oberland in 1802 , and following the Congress of Vienna of 1814 , it newly acquired the Bernese Jura . At this time , it once again became the largest canton of the confederacy as it stood during the Restoration and until the secession of the canton of Jura in 1979 . Bern was made the Federal City ( seat of the Federal Assembly ) within the new Swiss federal state in 1848 .
With the record company a global operation in 1965 , the Columbia Broadcasting System upper management started pondering changing the name of their record company subsidiary from Columbia Records to CBS Records .
When in choir dress , a Latin-rite cardinal wears scarlet garments — the blood-like red symbolizes a cardinal 's willingness to die for his faith . Excluding the rochet — which is always white — the scarlet garments include the cassock , mozzetta , and biretta ( over the usual scarlet zucchetto ) . The biretta of a cardinal is distinctive not merely for its scarlet color , but also for the fact that it does not have a pompon or tassel on the top as do the birettas of other prelates . Until the 1460s , it was customary for cardinals to wear a violet or blue cape unless granted the privilege of wearing red when acting on papal business . His normal-wear cassock is black but has scarlet piping and a scarlet fascia ( sash ) . Occasionally , a cardinal wears a scarlet ferraiolo which is a cape worn over the shoulders , tied at the neck in a bow by narrow strips of cloth in the front , without any 'trim ' or piping on it . It is because of the scarlet color of cardinals ' vesture that the bird of the same name has become known as such . [ citation needed ]
Muhammad Ali Pasha evolved the military from one that convened under the tradition of the corvée to a great modernised army . He introduced conscription of the male peasantry in 19th century Egypt , and took a novel approach to create his great army , strengthening it with numbers and in skill . Education and training of the new soldiers was not an option ; the new concepts were furthermore enforced by isolation . The men were held in barracks to avoid distraction of their growth as a military unit to be reckoned with . The resentment for the military way of life eventually faded from the men and a new ideology took hold , one of nationalism and pride . It was with the help of this newly reborn martial unit that Muhammad Ali imposed his rule over Egypt .
In July 2012 , Ancestry.com reported on historic and DNA research by its staff that discovered that Obama is likely a descendant through his mother of John Punch , considered by some historians to be the first African slave in the Virginia colony . An indentured servant , he was " bound for life " in 1640 after trying to escape . The story of him and his descendants is that of multi-racial America since it appeared he and his sons married or had unions with white women , likely indentured servants and working-class like them . Their multi-racial children were free because they were born to free English women . Over time , Obama 's line of the Bunch family ( as they became known ) were property owners and continued to " marry white " ; they became part of white society , likely by the early to mid-18th century .
There is disagreement about the origin of the term , but general consensus that " cardinalis " from the word cardo ( meaning 'pivot ' or 'hinge ' ) was first used in late antiquity to designate a bishop or priest who was incorporated into a church for which he had not originally been ordained . In Rome the first persons to be called cardinals were the deacons of the seven regions of the city at the beginning of the 6th century , when the word began to mean “ principal , ” “ eminent , ” or " superior . " The name was also given to the senior priest in each of the " title " churches ( the parish churches ) of Rome and to the bishops of the seven sees surrounding the city . By the 8th century the Roman cardinals constituted a privileged class among the Roman clergy . They took part in the administration of the church of Rome and in the papal liturgy . By decree of a synod of 769 , only a cardinal was eligible to become pope . In 1059 , during the pontificate of Nicholas II , cardinals were given the right to elect the pope under the Papal Bull In nomine Domini . For a time this power was assigned exclusively to the cardinal bishops , but the Third Lateran Council in 1179 gave back the right to the whole body of cardinals . Cardinals were granted the privilege of wearing the red hat by Pope Innocent IV in 1244 .
The Panthers used the San Jose State practice facility and stayed at the San Jose Marriott . The Broncos practiced at Stanford University and stayed at the Santa Clara Marriott .
Several dozen radioisotopes have been characterized . 65Zn , which has a half-life of 243.66 days , is the most long-lived radioisotope , followed by 72Zn with a half-life of 46.5 hours . Zinc has 10 nuclear isomers . 69mZn has the longest half-life , 13.76 h. The superscript m indicates a metastable isotope . The nucleus of a metastable isotope is in an excited state and will return to the ground state by emitting a photon in the form of a gamma ray . 61Zn has three excited states and 73Zn has two . The isotopes 65Zn , 71Zn , 77Zn and 78Zn each have only one excited state .
The second half of the 20th century to the present has seen a gradual shift towards improved human rights for Aboriginal people . In a 1967 referendum over 90 % of the Australian population voted to end constitutional discrimination and to include Aborigines in the national census . During this period many Aboriginal activists began to embrace the term " black " and use their ancestry as a source of pride . Activist Bob Maza said :
There are seven suburbicarian sees : Ostia , Albano , Porto and Santa Rufina , Palestrina , Sabina and Mentana , Frascati and Velletri . Velletri was united with Ostia from 1150 until 1914 , when Pope Pius X separated them again , but decreed that whatever cardinal bishop became Dean of the College of Cardinals would keep the suburbicarian see he already held , adding to it that of Ostia , with the result that there continued to be only six cardinal bishops .
Since 1962 , the cardinal bishops have only a titular relationship with the suburbicarian sees , with no powers of governance over them . Each see has its own bishop , with the exception of Ostia , in which the Cardinal Vicar of the see of Rome is apostolic administrator .
Luther taught that salvation and subsequently eternal life is not earned by good deeds but is received only as a free gift of God 's grace through faith in Jesus Christ as redeemer from sin . His theology challenged the authority and office of the Pope by teaching that the Bible is the only source of divinely revealed knowledge from God and opposed sacerdotalism by considering all baptized Christians to be a holy priesthood . Those who identify with these , and all of Luther 's wider teachings , are called Lutherans even though Luther insisted on Christian or Evangelical as the only acceptable names for individuals who professed Christ .
Blues rock acts that pioneered the sound included Cream , The Jimi Hendrix Experience , and The Jeff Beck Group . Cream , in songs like " I Feel Free " ( 1966 ) combined blues rock with pop and psychedelia , particularly in the riffs and guitar solos of Eric Clapton . Jimi Hendrix produced a form of blues-influenced psychedelic rock , which combined elements of jazz , blues and rock and roll . From 1967 Jeff Beck brought lead guitar to new heights of technical virtuosity and moved blues rock in the direction of heavy rock with his band , The Jeff Beck Group . Dave Davies of The Kinks , Keith Richards of The Rolling Stones , Pete Townshend of The Who , Hendrix , Clapton and Beck all pioneered the use of new guitar effects like phasing , feedback and distortion . The Beatles began producing songs in the new hard rock style beginning with the White Album in 1968 and , with the track " Helter Skelter " , attempted to create a greater level of noise than the Who . Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic has described the " proto-metal roar " of " Helter Skelter , " while Ian MacDonald argued that " their attempts at emulating the heavy style were without exception embarrassing . "
Zinc is a bluish-white , lustrous , diamagnetic metal , though most common commercial grades of the metal have a dull finish . It is somewhat less dense than iron and has a hexagonal crystal structure , with a distorted form of hexagonal close packing , in which each atom has six nearest neighbors ( at 265.9 pm ) in its own plane and six others at a greater distance of 290.6 pm . The metal is hard and brittle at most temperatures but becomes malleable between 100 and 150 °C . Above 210 °C , the metal becomes brittle again and can be pulverized by beating . Zinc is a fair conductor of electricity . For a metal , zinc has relatively low melting ( 419.5 °C ) and boiling points ( 907 °C ) . Its melting point is the lowest of all the transition metals aside from mercury and cadmium .
In the post-apartheid era , the Constitution of South Africa has declared the country to be a " Non-racial democracy " . In an effort to redress past injustices , the ANC government has introduced laws in support of affirmative action policies for Blacks ; under these they define " Black " people to include " Africans " , " Coloureds " and " Asians " . Some affirmative action policies favor " Africans " over " Coloureds " in terms of qualifying for certain benefits . Some South Africans categorized as " African Black " say that " Coloureds " did not suffer as much as they did during apartheid . " Coloured " South Africans are known to discuss their dilemma by saying , " we were not white enough under apartheid , and we are not black enough under the ANC ( African National Congress ) " .

Egyptian President Anwar Sadat had a mother who was a dark-skinned Nubian Sudanese woman and a father who was a lighter-skinned Egyptian . In response to an advertisement for an acting position , as a young man he said , " I am not white but I am not exactly black either . My blackness is tending to reddish " .
The flagship stations of each station in the markets of each team will carry their local play-by-play calls . In Denver , KOA ( 850 AM ) and KRFX ( 103.5 FM ) will carry the game , with Dave Logan on play-by-play and Ed McCaffrey on color commentary . In North Carolina , WBT ( 1110 AM ) will carry the game , with Mick Mixon on play-by-play and Eugene Robinson and Jim Szoke on color commentary . WBT will also simulcast the game on its sister station WBT-FM ( 99.3 FM ) , which is based in Chester , South Carolina . As KOA and WBT are both clear-channel stations , the local broadcasts will be audible over much of the western United States after sunset ( for Denver ) and the eastern United States throughout the game ( for Carolina ) . In accordance with contractual rules , the rest of the stations in the Broncos and Panthers radio networks will either carry the Westwood One feed or not carry the game at all .
Bern lies on the Swiss plateau in the Canton of Bern , slightly west of the centre of Switzerland and 20 km ( 12 mi ) north of the Bernese Alps . The countryside around Bern was formed by glaciers during the most recent Ice Age . The two mountains closest to Bern are Gurten with a height of 864 m ( 2,835 ft ) and Bantiger with a height of 947 m ( 3,107 ft ) . The site of the old observatory in Bern is the point of origin of the CH1903 coordinate system at 46°57′08.66″N 7°26′22.50″E﻿ / ﻿46.9524056°N 7.4395833°E﻿ / 46.9524056 ; 7.4395833 .
The Daily Mail newspaper reported in 2012 that the UK government 's benefits agency was checking claimants ' " Sky TV bills to establish if a woman in receipt of benefits as a single mother is wrongly claiming to be living alone " – as , it claimed , subscription to sports channels would betray a man 's presence in the household . In December , the UK ’ s parliament heard a claim that a subscription to BSkyB was ‘ often damaging ’ , along with alcohol , tobacco and gambling . Conservative MP Alec Shelbrooke was proposing the payments of benefits and tax credits on a " Welfare Cash Card " , in the style of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program , that could be used to buy only " essentials " .
QuickBooks sponsored a " Small Business Big Game " contest , in which Death Wish Coffee had a 30-second commercial aired free of charge courtesy of QuickBooks . Death Wish Coffee beat out nine other contenders from across the United States for the free advertisement .
The official language of the Republic is Modern Standard Arabic . Arabic was adopted by the Egyptians after the Arab invasion of Egypt . The spoken languages are : Egyptian Arabic ( 68 % ) , Sa'idi Arabic ( 29 % ) , Eastern Egyptian Bedawi Arabic ( 1.6 % ) , Sudanese Arabic ( 0.6 % ) , Domari ( 0.3 % ) , Nobiin ( 0.3 % ) , Beja ( 0.1 % ) , Siwi and others . Additionally , Greek , Armenian and Italian are the main languages of immigrants . In Alexandria in the 19th century there was a large community of Italian Egyptians and Italian was the " lingua franca " of the city .
The term " retro-metal " has been applied to such bands as Texas based The Sword , California 's High on Fire , Sweden 's Witchcraft and Australia 's Wolfmother . Wolfmother 's self-titled 2005 debut album combined elements of the sounds of Deep Purple and Led Zeppelin . Fellow Australians Airbourne 's début album Runnin ' Wild ( 2007 ) followed in the hard riffing tradition of AC/DC . England 's The Darkness ' Permission to Land ( 2003 ) , described as an " eerily realistic simulation of '80s metal and '70s glam " , topped the UK charts , going quintuple platinum . The follow-up , One Way Ticket to Hell ... and Back ( 2005 ) , reached number 11 , before the band broke up in 2006 . Los Angeles band Steel Panther managed to gain a following by sending up 80s glam metal . A more serious attempt to revive glam metal was made by bands of the sleaze metal movement in Sweden , including Vains of Jenna , Hardcore Superstar and Crashdïet .
Brass , which is an alloy of copper and zinc , has been used since at least the 10th century BC in Judea and by the 7th century BC in Ancient Greece . Zinc metal was not produced on a large scale until the 12th century in India and was unknown to Europe until the end of the 16th century . The mines of Rajasthan have given definite evidence of zinc production going back to the 6th century BC . To date , the oldest evidence of pure zinc comes from Zawar , in Rajasthan , as early as the 9th century AD when a distillation process was employed to make pure zinc . Alchemists burned zinc in air to form what they called " philosopher 's wool " or " white snow " .
Partly because of low sanitation coverage about 17,000 children die each year because of diarrhoea . Another challenge is low cost recovery due to water tariffs that are among the lowest in the world . This in turn requires government subsidies even for operating costs , a situation that has been aggravated by salary increases without tariff increases after the Arab Spring . Poor operation of facilities , such as water and wastewater treatment plants , as well as limited government accountability and transparency , are also issues .
Zinc deficiency is crop plants ' most common micronutrient deficiency ; it is particularly common in high-pH soils . Zinc-deficient soil is cultivated in the cropland of about half of Turkey and India , a third of China , and most of Western Australia , and substantial responses to zinc fertilization have been reported in these areas . Plants that grow in soils that are zinc-deficient are more susceptible to disease . Zinc is primarily added to the soil through the weathering of rocks , but humans have added zinc through fossil fuel combustion , mine waste , phosphate fertilizers , pesticide ( zinc phosphide ) , limestone , manure , sewage sludge , and particles from galvanized surfaces . Excess zinc is toxic to plants , although zinc toxicity is far less widespread .
Possibly as early as the second century AD , Virgil 's works were seen as having magical properties and were used for divination . In what became known as the Sortes Vergilianae ( Virgilian Lots ) , passages would be selected at random and interpreted to answer questions . In the 12th century , starting around Naples but eventually spreading widely throughout Europe , a tradition developed in which Virgil was regarded as a great magician . Legends about Virgil and his magical powers remained popular for over two hundred years , arguably becoming as prominent as his writings themselves . Virgil 's legacy in medieval Wales was such that the Welsh version of his name , Fferyllt or Pheryllt , became a generic term for magic-worker , and survives in the modern Welsh word for pharmacist , fferyllydd .
Luther 's Commentary on Genesis contains a passage which concludes that " the soul does not sleep ( anima non sic dormit ) , but wakes ( sed vigilat ) and experiences visions " . Francis Blackburne in 1765 argued that John Jortin misread this and other passages from Luther , while Gottfried Fritschel pointed out in 1867 that it actually refers to the soul of a man " in this life " ( homo enim in hac vita ) tired from his daily labour ( defatigus diurno labore ) who at night enters his bedchamber ( sub noctem intrat in cubiculum suum ) and whose sleep is interrupted by dreams .
64Zn , the most abundant isotope of zinc , is very susceptible to neutron activation , being transmuted into the highly radioactive 65Zn , which has a half-life of 244 days and produces intense gamma radiation . Because of this , Zinc Oxide used in nuclear reactors as an anti-corrosion agent is depleted of 64Zn before use , this is called depleted zinc oxide . For the same reason , zinc has been proposed as a salting material for nuclear weapons ( cobalt is another , better-known salting material ) . A jacket of isotopically enriched 64Zn would be irradiated by the intense high-energy neutron flux from an exploding thermonuclear weapon , forming a large amount of 65Zn significantly increasing the radioactivity of the weapon 's fallout . Such a weapon is not known to have ever been built , tested , or used . 65Zn is also used as a tracer to study how alloys that contain zinc wear out , or the path and the role of zinc in organisms .
His translation of the Bible into the vernacular ( instead of Latin ) made it more accessible , which had a tremendous impact on the church and German culture . It fostered the development of a standard version of the German language , added several principles to the art of translation , and influenced the writing of an English translation , the Tyndale Bible . His hymns influenced the development of singing in churches . His marriage to Katharina von Bora set a model for the practice of clerical marriage , allowing Protestant clergy to marry .
This was the first Super Bowl to feature a quarterback on both teams who was the # 1 pick in their draft classes . Manning was the # 1 selection of the 1998 NFL draft , while Newton was picked first in 2011 . The matchup also pits the top two picks of the 2011 draft against each other : Newton for Carolina and Von Miller for Denver . Manning and Newton also set the record for the largest age difference between opposing Super Bowl quarterbacks at 13 years and 48 days ( Manning was 39 , Newton was 26 ) .
Martin Luther was born to Hans Luder ( or Ludher , later Luther ) and his wife Margarethe ( née Lindemann ) on 10 November 1483 in Eisleben , Saxony , then part of the Holy Roman Empire . He was baptized as a Catholic the next morning on the feast day of St. Martin of Tours . His family moved to Mansfeld in 1484 , where his father was a leaseholder of copper mines and smelters and served as one of four citizen representatives on the local council . The religious scholar Martin Marty describes Luther 's mother as a hard-working woman of " trading-class stock and middling means " and notes that Luther 's enemies later wrongly described her as a whore and bath attendant . He had several brothers and sisters , and is known to have been close to one of them , Jacob . Hans Luther was ambitious for himself and his family , and he was determined to see Martin , his eldest son , become a lawyer . He sent Martin to Latin schools in Mansfeld , then Magdeburg in 1497 , where he attended a school operated by a lay group called the Brethren of the Common Life , and Eisenach in 1498 . The three schools focused on the so-called " trivium " : grammar , rhetoric , and logic . Luther later compared his education there to purgatory and hell .
The chemistry of zinc is dominated by the +2 oxidation state . When compounds in this oxidation state are formed the outer shell s electrons are lost , which yields a bare zinc ion with the electronic configuration [ Ar ] 3d10 . In aqueous solution an octahedral complex , [ Zn ( H 2O ) 6 ] 2+ is the predominant species . The volatilization of zinc in combination with zinc chloride at temperatures above 285 °C indicates the formation of Zn 2Cl 2 , a zinc compound with a +1 oxidation state . No compounds of zinc in oxidation states other than +1 or +2 are known . Calculations indicate that a zinc compound with the oxidation state of +4 is unlikely to exist .
CBS provided digital streams of the game via CBSSports.com , and the CBS Sports apps on tablets , Windows 10 , Xbox One and other digital media players ( such as Chromecast and Roku ) . Due to Verizon Communications exclusivity , streaming on smartphones was only provided to Verizon Wireless customers via the NFL Mobile service . The ESPN Deportes Spanish broadcast was made available through WatchESPN .
Westwood One will carry the game throughout North America , with Kevin Harlan as play-by-play announcer , Boomer Esiason and Dan Fouts as color analysts , and James Lofton and Mark Malone as sideline reporters . Jim Gray will anchor the pre-game and halftime coverage .
Luther secretly returned to Wittenberg on 6 March 1522 . He wrote to the Elector : " During my absence , Satan has entered my sheepfold , and committed ravages which I can not repair by writing , but only by my personal presence and living word . " For eight days in Lent , beginning on Invocavit Sunday , 9 March , Luther preached eight sermons , which became known as the " Invocavit Sermons " . In these sermons , he hammered home the primacy of core Christian values such as love , patience , charity , and freedom , and reminded the citizens to trust God 's word rather than violence to bring about necessary change .
Bern is also served by Bern Airport , located outside the city near the town of Belp . The regional airport , colloquially called Bern-Belp or Belpmoos , is connected to several European cities . Additionally Zürich Airport , Geneva Airport and EuroAirport Basel-Mulhouse-Freiburg also serve as international gateways , all reachable within two hours by car or train from Bern .
Modern Egypt is considered to be a regional and middle power , with significant cultural , political , and military influence in North Africa , the Middle East and the Muslim world . Its economy is one of the largest and most diversified in the Middle East , with sectors such as tourism , agriculture , industry and services at almost equal production levels . In 2011 , longtime President Hosni Mubarak stepped down amid mass protests . Later elections saw the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood , which was ousted by the army a year later amid mass protests .
Luther 's translation used the variant of German spoken at the Saxon chancellery , intelligible to both northern and southern Germans . He intended his vigorous , direct language to make the Bible accessible to everyday Germans , " for we are removing impediments and difficulties so that other people may read it without hindrance . "
For fortification , however , a 2003 review recommended zinc oxide in cereals as cheap , stable , and as easily absorbed as more expensive forms . A 2005 study found that various compounds of zinc , including oxide and sulfate , did not show statistically significant differences in absorption when added as fortificants to maize tortillas . A 1987 study found that zinc picolinate was better absorbed than zinc gluconate or zinc citrate . However , a study published in 2008 determined that zinc glycinate is the best absorbed of the four dietary supplement types available .
As of 2000 [ update ] , there were 67,115 private households in the municipality , and an average of 1.8 persons per household . There were 34,981 households that consist of only one person and 1,592 households with five or more people . In 2000 [ update ] , a total of 65,538 apartments ( 90.6 % of the total ) were permanently occupied , while 5,352 apartments ( 7.4 % ) were seasonally occupied and 1,444 apartments ( 2.0 % ) were empty . As of 2009 [ update ] , the construction rate of new housing units was 1.2 new units per 1000 residents .
Weinreich 's identity variant similarly includes the categories of identity diffusion , foreclosure and crisis , but with a somewhat different emphasis . Here , with respect to identity diffusion for example , an optimal level is interpreted as the norm , as it is unrealistic to expect an individual to resolve all their conflicted identifications with others ; therefore we should be alert to individuals with levels which are much higher or lower than the norm – highly diffused individuals are classified as diffused , and those with low levels as foreclosed or defensive . ( Weinreich & Saunderson , 2003 , pp 65–67 ; 105-106 ) . Weinreich applies the identity variant in a framework which also allows for the transition from one to another by way of biographical experiences and resolution of conflicted identifications situated in various contexts – for example , an adolescent going through family break-up may be in one state , whereas later in a stable marriage with a secure professional role may be in another . Hence , though there is continuity , there is also development and change . ( Weinreich & Saunderson , 2003 , pp 22–23 ) .
Luther 's disappearance during his return trip back to Wittenberg was planned . Frederick III had him intercepted on his way home in the forest near Wittenberg by masked horsemen who were made to appear as armed highwaymen . They escorted Luther to the security of the Wartburg Castle at Eisenach . During his stay at Wartburg , which he referred to as " my Patmos " , Luther translated the New Testament from Greek into German and poured out doctrinal and polemical writings . These included a renewed attack on Archbishop Albrecht of Mainz , whom he shamed into halting the sale of indulgences in his episcopates , and a " Refutation of the Argument of Latomus , " in which he expounded the principle of justification to Jacobus Latomus , an orthodox theologian from Louvain .
In 1521 Luther dealt largely with prophecy , in which he broadened the foundations of the Reformation placing them on prophetic faith . His main interest was centered on the prophecy of the Little Horn in Daniel 8:9–12 , 23–25 . The antichrist of 2 Thessalonians 2 was identified as the power of the Papacy . So too was the Little Horn of Daniel 7 , coming up among the divisions of Rome , explicitly applied .
The Negritos are believed to be the first inhabitants of Southeast Asia . Once inhabiting Taiwan , Vietnam , and various other parts of Asia , they are now confined primarily to Thailand , the Malay Archipelago , and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands . Negrito means " little black people " in Spanish ( negrito is the Spanish diminutive of negro , i.e. , " little black person " ) ; it is what the Spaniards called the short-statured , hunter-gatherer autochthones that they encountered in the Philippines . Despite this , Negritos are never referred to as black today , and doing so would cause offense . The term Negrito itself has come under criticism in countries like Malaysia , where it is now interchangeable with the more acceptable Semang , although this term actually refers to a specific group . The common Thai word for Negritos literally means " frizzy hair " .
The Lutheran theologian Franz Pieper observed that Luther 's teaching about the state of the Christian 's soul after death differed from the later Lutheran theologians such as Johann Gerhard . Lessing ( 1755 ) had earlier reached the same conclusion in his analysis of Lutheran orthodoxy on this issue .
Indigenous Australians have been referred to as " black people " in Australia since the early days of European settlement . While originally related to skin colour , the term is used to today to indicate Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander ancestry in general and can refer to people of any skin pigmentation .
From 1510 to 1520 , Luther lectured on the Psalms , the books of Hebrews , Romans , and Galatians . As he studied these portions of the Bible , he came to view the use of terms such as penance and righteousness by the Catholic Church in new ways . He became convinced that the church was corrupt in its ways and had lost sight of what he saw as several of the central truths of Christianity . The most important for Luther was the doctrine of justification – God 's act of declaring a sinner righteous – by faith alone through God 's grace . He began to teach that salvation or redemption is a gift of God 's grace , attainable only through faith in Jesus as the Messiah . " This one and firm rock , which we call the doctrine of justification , " he wrote , " is the chief article of the whole Christian doctrine , which comprehends the understanding of all godliness . "
In 1059 , the right of electing the pope was reserved to the principal clergy of Rome and the bishops of the seven suburbicarian sees . In the 12th century the practice of appointing ecclesiastics from outside Rome as cardinals began , with each of them assigned a church in Rome as his titular church or linked with one of the suburbicarian dioceses , while still being incardinated in a diocese other than that of Rome .

Denver took the opening kickoff and started out strong with Peyton Manning completing an 18-yard pass to tight end Owen Daniels and a 22-yard throw to receiver Andre Caldwell . A pair of carries by C. J. Anderson moved the ball up 20 yards to the Panthers 14-yard line , but Carolina 's defense dug in over the next three plays . First , linebacker Shaq Thompson tackled Ronnie Hillman for a 3-yard loss . Then after an incompletion , Thomas Davis tackled Anderson for a 1-yard gain on third down , forcing Denver to settle for a 3–0 lead on a Brandon McManus 34-yard field goal . The score marked the first time in the entire postseason that Carolina was facing a deficit .

In modern times , the name " cardinal priest " is interpreted as meaning a cardinal who is of the order of priests . Originally , however , this referred to certain key priests of important churches of the Diocese of Rome , who were recognized as the cardinal priests , the important priests chosen by the pope to advise him in his duties as Bishop of Rome ( the Latin cardo means " hinge " ) . Certain clerics in many dioceses at the time , not just that of Rome , were said to be the key personnel — the term gradually became exclusive to Rome to indicate those entrusted with electing the bishop of Rome , the pope .
Some consider koshari ( a mixture of rice , lentils , and macaroni ) to be the national dish . Fried onions can be also added to koshari . In addition , ful medames ( mashed fava beans ) is one of the most popular dishes . Fava bean is also used in making falafel ( also known as " ta'meyya " ) , which may have originated in Egypt and spread to other parts of the Middle East . Garlic fried with coriander is added to mulukhiyya , a popular green soup made from finely chopped jute leaves , sometimes with chicken or rabbit .
UNFPA 's connection to China 's administration of forced abortions was refuted by investigations carried out by various US , UK , and UN teams sent to examine UNFPA activities in China . Specifically , a three-person U.S State Department fact-finding team was sent on a two-week tour throughout China . It wrote in a report to the State Department that it found " no evidence that UNFPA has supported or participated in the management of a program of coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization in China , " as has been charged by critics .
Mary 's complete sinlessness and concomitant exemption from any taint from the first moment of her existence was a doctrine familiar to Greek theologians of Byzantium . Beginning with St. Gregory Nazianzen , his explanation of the " purification " of Jesus and Mary at the circumcision ( Luke 2:22 ) prompted him to consider the primary meaning of " purification " in Christology ( and by extension in Mariology ) to refer to a perfectly sinless nature that manifested itself in glory in a moment of grace ( e.g. , Jesus at his Baptism ) . St. Gregory Nazianzen designated Mary as " prokathartheisa ( prepurified ) . " Gregory likely attempted to solve the riddle of the Purification of Jesus and Mary in the Temple through considering the human natures of Jesus and Mary as equally holy and therefore both purified in this manner of grace and glory . Gregory 's doctrines surrounding Mary 's purification were likely related to the burgeoning commemoration of the Mother of God in and around Constantinople very close to the date of Christmas . Nazianzen 's title of Mary at the Annunciation as " prepurified " was subsequently adopted by all theologians interested in his Mariology to justify the Byzantine equivalent of the Immaculate Conception . This is especially apparent in the Fathers St. Sophronios of Jerusalem and St. John Damascene , who will be treated below in this article at the section on Church Fathers . About the time of Damascene , the public celebration of the " Conception of St. Ann [ i.e. , of the Theotokos in her womb ] " was becoming popular . After this period , the " purification " of the perfect natures of Jesus and Mary would not only mean moments of grace and glory at the Incarnation and Baptism and other public Byzantine liturgical feasts , but purification was eventually associated with the feast of Mary 's very conception ( along with her Presentation in the Temple as a toddler ) by Orthodox authors of the 2nd millennium ( e.g. , St. Nicholas Cabasilas and Joseph Bryennius ) .
During the apartheid era , those classed as " Coloured " were oppressed and discriminated against . But , they had limited rights and overall had slightly better socioeconomic conditions than those classed as " Black " . The government required that Blacks and Coloureds live in areas separate from Whites , creating large townships located away from the cities as areas for Blacks .
As of 2000 [ update ] , there were 9,045 pupils in Bern who came from another municipality , while 1,185 residents attended schools outside the municipality .
By 1962 , their Columbia Record Productions unit was operating four plants around the United States located in Los Angeles ; Terre Haute , Indiana ; Bridgeport , Connecticut ; and Pitman , New Jersey , which manufactured records for not only Columbia 's own labels , but also for independent record labels .
CBS provided digital streams of the game via CBSSports.com , and the CBS Sports apps on tablets , Windows 10 , Xbox One and other digital media players ( such as Chromecast and Roku ) . Due to Verizon Communications exclusivity , streaming on smartphones was only provided to Verizon Wireless customers via the NFL Mobile service . The ESPN Deportes Spanish broadcast was made available through WatchESPN .
On June 4 , 2014 , the NFL announced that the practice of branding Super Bowl games with Roman numerals , a practice established at Super Bowl V , would be temporarily suspended , and that the game would be named using Arabic numerals as Super Bowl 50 as opposed to Super Bowl L. The use of Roman numerals will be reinstated for Super Bowl LI . Jaime Weston , the league 's vice president of brand and creative , explained that a primary reason for the change was the difficulty of designing an aesthetically pleasing logo with the letter " L " using the standardized logo template introduced at Super Bowl XLV . The logo also deviates from the template by featuring large numerals , colored in gold , behind the Vince Lombardi Trophy , instead of underneath and in silver as in the standard logo .
In 1978 Aboriginal writer Kevin Gilbert received the National Book Council award for his book Living Black : Blacks Talk to Kevin Gilbert , a collection of Aboriginal people 's stories , and in 1998 was awarded ( but refused to accept ) the Human Rights Award for Literature for Inside Black Australia , a poetry anthology and exhibition of Aboriginal photography . In contrast to previous definitions based solely on the degree of Aboriginal ancestry , in 1990 the Government changed the legal definition of Aboriginal to include any :
Published at a time of rising demand for German-language publications , Luther 's version quickly became a popular and influential Bible translation . As such , it made a significant contribution to the evolution of the German language and literature . Furnished with notes and prefaces by Luther , and with woodcuts by Lucas Cranach that contained anti-papal imagery , it played a major role in the spread of Luther 's doctrine throughout Germany . The Luther Bible influenced other vernacular translations , such as William Tyndale 's English Bible ( 1525 forward ) , a precursor of the King James Bible .
It was not until January 1518 that friends of Luther translated the 95 Theses from Latin into German and printed and widely copied them , making the controversy one of the first in history to be aided by the printing press . Within two weeks , copies of the theses had spread throughout Germany ; within two months , they had spread throughout Europe .
Early in 1537 , Johannes Agricola ( 1494–1566 ) – serving at the time as pastor in Luther 's birthplace , Eisleben – preached a sermon in which he claimed that God 's gospel , not God 's moral law ( the Ten Commandments ) , revealed God 's wrath to Christians . Based on this sermon and others by Agricola , Luther suspected that Agricola was behind certain anonymous antinomian theses circulating in Wittenberg . These theses asserted that the law is no longer to be taught to Christians but belonged only to city hall . Luther responded to these theses with six series of theses against Agricola and the antinomians , four of which became the basis for disputations between 1538 and 1540 . He also responded to these assertions in other writings , such as his 1539 open letter to C. Güttel Against the Antinomians , and his book On the Councils and the Church from the same year .
Indigenous Australians have been referred to as " black people " in Australia since the early days of European settlement . While originally related to skin colour , the term is used to today to indicate Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander ancestry in general and can refer to people of any skin pigmentation .
As a result of modernisation efforts over the years , Egypt 's healthcare system has made great strides forward . Access to healthcare in both urban and rural areas greatly improved and immunisation programs are now able to cover 98 % of the population . Life expectancy increased from 44.8 years during the 1960s to 72.12 years in 2009 . There was a noticeable decline of the infant mortality rate ( during the 1970s to the 1980s the infant mortality rate was 101-132/1000 live births , in 2000 the rate was 50-60/1000 , and in 2008 it was 28-30/1000 ) .
On 13 June 1525 , the couple was engaged with Johannes Bugenhagen , Justus Jonas , Johannes Apel , Philipp Melanchthon and Lucas Cranach the Elder and his wife as witnesses . On the evening of the same day , the couple was married by Bugenhagen . The ceremonial walk to the church and the wedding banquet were left out , and were made up two weeks later on 27 June .
Luther and his colleagues introduced the new order of worship during their visitation of the Electorate of Saxony , which began in 1527 . They also assessed the standard of pastoral care and Christian education in the territory . " Merciful God , what misery I have seen , " Luther wrote , " the common people knowing nothing at all of Christian doctrine ... and unfortunately many pastors are well-nigh unskilled and incapable of teaching . "
The works of Virgil almost from the moment of their publication revolutionized Latin poetry . The Eclogues , Georgics , and above all the Aeneid became standard texts in school curricula with which all educated Romans were familiar . Poets following Virgil often refer intertextually to his works to generate meaning in their own poetry . The Augustan poet Ovid parodies the opening lines of the Aeneid in Amores 1.1.1–2 , and his summary of the Aeneas story in Book 14 of the Metamorphoses , the so-called " mini-Aeneid " , has been viewed as a particularly important example of post-Virgilian response to the epic genre . Lucan 's epic , the Bellum Civile has been considered an anti-Virgilian epic , disposing with the divine mechanism , treating historical events , and diverging drastically from Virgilian epic practice . The Flavian poet Statius in his 12-book epic Thebaid engages closely with the poetry of Virgil ; in his epilogue he advises his poem not to " rival the divine Aeneid , but follow afar and ever venerate its footsteps . " In Silius Italicus , Virgil finds one of his most ardent admirers . With almost every line of his epic Punica Silius references Virgil . Indeed , Silius is known to have bought Virgil 's tomb and worshipped the poet . Partially as a result of his so-called " Messianic " Fourth Eclogue—widely interpreted later to have predicted the birth of Jesus Christ—Virgil was in later antiquity imputed to have the magical abilities of a seer ; the Sortes Vergilianae , the process of using Virgil 's poetry as a tool of divination , is found in the time of Hadrian , and continued into the Middle Ages . In a similar vein Macrobius in the Saturnalia credits the work of Virgil as the embodiment of human knowledge and experience , mirroring the Greek conception of Homer . Virgil also found commentators in antiquity . Servius , a commentator of the 4th century AD , based his work on the commentary of Donatus . Servius ' commentary provides us with a great deal of information about Virgil 's life , sources , and references ; however , many modern scholars find the variable quality of his work and the often simplistic interpretations frustrating .
It includes the entire Old Town , which is also a UNESCO World Heritage Site , and many sites within and around it . Some of the most notable in the Old Town include the Cathedral which was started in 1421 and is the tallest cathedral in Switzerland , the Zytglogge and Käfigturm towers , which mark two successive expansions of the Old Town , and the Holy Ghost Church , which is one of the largest Swiss Reformed churches in Switzerland . Within the Old Town , there are eleven 16th century fountains , most attributed to Hans Gieng , that are on the list .
Luther and his wife moved into a former monastery , " The Black Cloister , " a wedding present from the new elector John the Steadfast ( 1525–32 ) . They embarked on what appeared to have been a happy and successful marriage , though money was often short . Between bearing six children , Hans – June 1526 ; Elizabeth – 10 December 1527 , who died within a few months ; Magdalene – 1529 , who died in Luther 's arms in 1542 ; Martin – 1531 ; Paul – January 1533 ; and Margaret – 1534 ; Katharina helped the couple earn a living by farming the land and taking in boarders . Luther confided to Michael Stiefel on 11 August 1526 : " My Katie is in all things so obliging and pleasing to me that I would not exchange my poverty for the riches of Croesus . "
For the first time , the Super Bowl 50 Host Committee and the NFL have openly sought disabled veteran and lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender-owned businesses in Business Connect , the Super Bowl program that provides local companies with contracting opportunities in and around the Super Bowl . The host committee has already raised over $ 40 million through sponsors including Apple , Google , Yahoo ! , Intel , Gap , Chevron , and Dignity Health .
A psychological identity relates to self-image ( one 's mental model of oneself ) , self-esteem , and individuality . Consequently , Weinreich gives the definition " A person 's identity is defined as the totality of one 's self-construal , in which how one construes oneself in the present expresses the continuity between how one construes oneself as one was in the past and how one construes oneself as one aspires to be in the future " ; this allows for definitions of aspects of identity , such as : " One 's ethnic identity is defined as that part of the totality of one 's self-construal made up of those dimensions that express the continuity between one 's construal of past ancestry and one 's future aspirations in relation to ethnicity " ( Weinreich , 1986a ) .
In 2007 , BSkyB and Virgin Media became involved in a dispute over the carriage of Sky channels on cable TV . The failure to renew the existing carriage agreements negotiated with NTL and Telewest resulted in Virgin Media removing the basic channels from the network on 1 March 2007 . Virgin Media claimed that BSkyB had substantially increased the asking price for the channels , a claim which BSkyB denied , on the basis that their new deal offered " substantially more value " by including HD channels and Video On Demand content which was not previously carried by cable .
The Broncos defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers in the divisional round , 23–16 , by scoring 11 points in the final three minutes of the game . They then beat the defending Super Bowl XLIX champion New England Patriots in the AFC Championship Game , 20–18 , by intercepting a pass on New England 's 2-point conversion attempt with 17 seconds left on the clock . Despite Manning 's problems with interceptions during the season , he did n't throw any in their two playoff games .
The apartheid bureaucracy devised complex ( and often arbitrary ) criteria in the Population Registration Act of 1945 to determine who belonged in which group . Minor officials administered tests to enforce the classifications . When it was unclear from a person 's physical appearance whether the individual should be considered Coloured or Black , the " pencil test " was used . A pencil was inserted into a person 's hair to determine if the hair was kinky enough to hold the pencil , rather than having it pass through , as it would with smoother hair . If so , the person was classified as Black . Such classifications sometimes divided families .
The roots of hard rock can be traced back to the 1950s , particularly electric blues , which laid the foundations for key elements such as a rough declamatory vocal style , heavy guitar riffs , string-bending blues-scale guitar solos , strong beat , thick riff-laden texture , and posturing performances . Electric blues guitarists began experimenting with hard rock elements such as driving rhythms , distorted guitar solos and power chords in the 1950s , evident in the work of Memphis blues guitarists such as Joe Hill Louis , Willie Johnson , and particularly Pat Hare , who captured a " grittier , nastier , more ferocious electric guitar sound " on records such as James Cotton 's " Cotton Crop Blues " ( 1954 ) . Other antecedents include Link Wray 's instrumental " Rumble " in 1958 , and the surf rock instrumentals of Dick Dale , such as " Let 's Go Trippin ' " ( 1961 ) and " Misirlou " ( 1962 ) .
Concerns were raised over whether Levi 's Stadium 's field was of a high enough quality to host a Super Bowl ; during the inaugural season , the field had to be re-sodded multiple times due to various issues , and during a week 6 game earlier in the 2015 season , a portion of the turf collapsed under Baltimore Ravens kicker Justin Tucker , causing him to slip and miss a field goal , although the field has not had any major issues since . As is customary for Super Bowl games played at natural grass stadiums , the NFL re-sodded the field with a new playing surface ; a hybrid Bermuda 419 turf . NFL and Atlanta Braves field director Ed Mangan stated that the field was in " great shape " for gameday . However , the turf showed problem throughout the game , with a number of players needing to change their cleats during the game and player slipping during plays all throughout the game .
Carolina suffered a major setback when Thomas Davis , an 11-year veteran who had already overcome three ACL tears in his career , went down with a broken arm in the NFC Championship Game . Despite this , he insisted he would still find a way to play in the Super Bowl . His prediction turned out to be accurate .
Chinese political philosophy dates back to the Spring and Autumn Period , specifically with Confucius in the 6th century BC . Chinese political philosophy was developed as a response to the social and political breakdown of the country characteristic of the Spring and Autumn Period and the Warring States period . The major philosophies during the period , Confucianism , Legalism , Mohism , Agrarianism and Taoism , each had a political aspect to their philosophical schools . Philosophers such as Confucius , Mencius , and Mozi , focused on political unity and political stability as the basis of their political philosophies . Confucianism advocated a hierarchical , meritocratic government based on empathy , loyalty , and interpersonal relationships . Legalism advocated a highly authoritarian government based on draconian punishments and laws . Mohism advocated a communal , decentralized government centered on frugality and ascetism . The Agrarians advocated a peasant utopian communalism and egalitarianism . Taoism advocated a proto-anarchism . Legalism was the dominant political philosophy of the Qin Dynasty , but was replaced by State Confucianism in the Han Dynasty . Prior to China 's adoption of communism , State Confucianism remained the dominant political philosophy of China up to the 20th century .
Other than by appearance , " Coloureds " can usually be distinguished from " Blacks " by language . Most speak Afrikaans or English as a first language , as opposed to Bantu languages such as Zulu or Xhosa . They also tend to have more European-sounding names than Bantu names .
In response , the EU decided to fill the gap left behind by the US under the Sandbaek report . According to its Annual Report for 2008 , the UNFPA received its funding mainly from European Governments : Of the total income of M845.3 M , $ 118 was donated by the Netherlands , $ 67 M by Sweden , $ 62 M by Norway , $ 54 M by Denmark , $ 53 M by the UK , $ 52 M by Spain , $ 19 M by Luxembourg . The European Commission donated further $ 36 M. The most important non-European donor State was Japan ( $ 36 M ) . The number of donors exceeded 180 in one year .
Blues rock acts that pioneered the sound included Cream , The Jimi Hendrix Experience , and The Jeff Beck Group . Cream , in songs like " I Feel Free " ( 1966 ) combined blues rock with pop and psychedelia , particularly in the riffs and guitar solos of Eric Clapton . Jimi Hendrix produced a form of blues-influenced psychedelic rock , which combined elements of jazz , blues and rock and roll . From 1967 Jeff Beck brought lead guitar to new heights of technical virtuosity and moved blues rock in the direction of heavy rock with his band , The Jeff Beck Group . Dave Davies of The Kinks , Keith Richards of The Rolling Stones , Pete Townshend of The Who , Hendrix , Clapton and Beck all pioneered the use of new guitar effects like phasing , feedback and distortion . The Beatles began producing songs in the new hard rock style beginning with the White Album in 1968 and , with the track " Helter Skelter " , attempted to create a greater level of noise than the Who . Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic has described the " proto-metal roar " of " Helter Skelter , " while Ian MacDonald argued that " their attempts at emulating the heavy style were without exception embarrassing . "
Some Western writers claim that the immaculate conception of Mary is a teaching of Islam . Thus , commenting in 1734 on the passage in the Qur'an , " I have called her Mary ; and I commend her to thy protection , and also her issue , against Satan driven away with stones " , George Sale stated : " It is not improbable that the pretended immaculate conception of the virgin Mary is intimated in this passage . For according to a tradition of Mohammed , every person that comes into the world , is touched at his birth by the devil , and therefore cries out , Mary and her son only excepted ; between whom , and the evil spirit God placed a veil , so that his touch did not reach them . And for this reason they say , neither of them were guilty of any sin , like the rest of the children of Adam . "
The Byzantines were able to regain control of the country after a brief Sasanian Persian invasion early in the 7th century amidst the Byzantine–Sasanian War of 602–628 during which they established a new short-lived province for ten years known as Sasanian Egypt , until 639–42 , when Egypt was invaded and conquered by the Islamic Empire by the Muslim Arabs . When they defeated the Byzantine Armies in Egypt , the Arabs brought Sunni Islam to the country . Early in this period , Egyptians began to blend their new faith with indigenous beliefs and practices , leading to various Sufi orders that have flourished to this day . These earlier rites had survived the period of Coptic Christianity .
By 750 , the feast of her conception was widely celebrated in the Byzantine East , under the name of the Conception ( active ) of Saint Anne . In the West it was known as the feast of the Conception ( passive ) of Mary , and was associated particularly with the Normans , whether these introduced it directly from the East or took it from English usage . The spread of the feast , by now with the adjective " Immaculate " attached to its title , met opposition on the part of some , on the grounds that sanctification was possible only after conception . Critics included Saints Bernard of Clairvaux , Albertus Magnus and Thomas Aquinas . Other theologians defended the expression " Immaculate Conception " , pointing out that sanctification could be conferred at the first moment of conception in view of the foreseen merits of Christ , a view held especially by Franciscans .
Egypt has hosted several international competitions . the last one was 2009 FIFA U-20 World Cup which took place between 24 September - 16 October 2009 . On Friday 19 September of the year 2014 , Guinness World Records has announced that Egyptian scuba diver Ahmed Gabr is the new title holder for deepest salt water scuba dive , at 332.35 metres . Ahmed set a new world record Friday when he reached a depth of more than 1,000 feet . The 14-hour feat took Gabr 1,066 feet down into the abyss near the Egyptian town of Dahab in ther Red Sea , where he works as a diving instructor .
The description or representation of individual and group identity is a central task for psychologists , sociologists and anthropologists and those of other disciplines where " identity " needs to be mapped and defined . How should one describe the identity of another , in ways which encompass both their idiosyncratic qualities and their group memberships or identifications , both of which can shift according to circumstance ? Following on from the work of Kelly , Erikson , Tajfel and others Weinreich 's Identity Structure Analysis ( ISA ) , is " a structural representation of the individual 's existential experience , in which the relationships between self and other agents are organised in relatively stable structures over time … with the emphasis on the socio-cultural milieu in which self relates to other agents and institutions " ( Weinreich and Saunderson , ( eds ) 2003 , p1 ) . Using constructs drawn from the salient discourses of the individual , the group and cultural norms , the practical operationalisation of ISA provides a methodology that maps how these are used by the individual , applied across time and milieus by the " situated self " to appraise self and other agents and institutions ( for example , resulting in the individual 's evaluation of self and significant others and institutions ) .

The doctrine of the immaculate conception ( Mary being conceived free from original sin ) is not to be confused with her virginal conception of her son Jesus . This misunderstanding of the term immaculate conception is frequently met in the mass media . Catholics believe that Mary was not the product of a virginal conception herself but was the daughter of a human father and mother , traditionally known by the names of Saint Joachim and Saint Anne . In 1677 , the Holy See condemned the belief that Mary was virginally conceived , which had been a belief surfacing occasionally since the 4th century . The Church celebrates the Feast of the Immaculate Conception ( when Mary was conceived free from original sin ) on 8 December , exactly nine months before celebrating the Nativity of Mary . The feast of the Annunciation ( which commemorates the virginal conception and the Incarnation of Jesus ) is celebrated on 25 March , nine months before Christmas Day .
Over the next five days , private conferences were held to determine Luther 's fate . The Emperor presented the final draft of the Edict of Worms on 25 May 1521 , declaring Luther an outlaw , banning his literature , and requiring his arrest : " We want him to be apprehended and punished as a notorious heretic . " It also made it a crime for anyone in Germany to give Luther food or shelter . It permitted anyone to kill Luther without legal consequence .
Often categorised with the New Wave of British Heavy Metal , in 1981 Def Leppard released their second album High 'n ' Dry , mixing glam-rock with heavy metal , and helping to define the sound of hard rock for the decade . The follow-up Pyromania ( 1983 ) , reached number two on the American charts and the singles " Photograph " , " Rock of Ages " and " Foolin ' " , helped by the emergence of MTV , all reached the Top 40 . It was widely emulated , particularly by the emerging Californian glam metal scene . This was followed by US acts like Mötley Crüe , with their albums Too Fast for Love ( 1981 ) and Shout at the Devil ( 1983 ) and , as the style grew , the arrival of bands such as Ratt , White Lion , Twisted Sister and Quiet Riot . Quiet Riot 's album Metal Health ( 1983 ) was the first glam metal album , and arguably the first heavy metal album of any kind , to reach number one in the Billboard music charts and helped open the doors for mainstream success by subsequent bands .
In addition to the Vince Lombardi Trophy that all Super Bowl champions receive , the winner of Super Bowl 50 will also receive a large , 18-karat gold-plated " 50 " . Each digit will weigh 33 lb ( 15 kg ) for a total of 66 lb ( 30 kg ) . Like the Lombardi Trophy , the " 50 " will be designed by Tiffany & Co .
For fortification , however , a 2003 review recommended zinc oxide in cereals as cheap , stable , and as easily absorbed as more expensive forms . A 2005 study found that various compounds of zinc , including oxide and sulfate , did not show statistically significant differences in absorption when added as fortificants to maize tortillas . A 1987 study found that zinc picolinate was better absorbed than zinc gluconate or zinc citrate . However , a study published in 2008 determined that zinc glycinate is the best absorbed of the four dietary supplement types available .
The Broncos ' defense ranked first in the NFL yards allowed ( 4,530 ) for the first time in franchise history , and fourth in points allowed ( 296 ) . Defensive ends Derek Wolfe and Malik Jackson each had 5½ sacks . Pro Bowl linebacker Von Miller led the team with 11 sacks , forced four fumbles , and recovered three . Linebacker DeMarcus Ware was selected to play in the Pro Bowl for the ninth time in his career , ranking second on the team with 7½ sacks . Linebacker Brandon Marshall led the team in total tackles with 109 , while Danny Trevathan ranked second with 102 . Cornerbacks Aqib Talib ( three interceptions ) and Chris Harris , Jr. ( two interceptions ) were the other two Pro Bowl selections from the defense .
Luther wrote " Ach Gott , vom Himmel sieh darein " ( " Oh God , look down from heaven " ) . " Nun komm , der Heiden Heiland " ( Now come , Savior of the gentiles ) , based on Veni redemptor gentium , became the main hymn ( Hauptlied ) for Advent . He transformed A solus ortus cardine to " Christum wir sollen loben schon " ( " We should now praise Christ " ) and Veni Creator Spiritus to " Komm , Gott Schöpfer , Heiliger Geist " ( " Come , Holy Spirit , Lord God " ) . He wrote two hymns on the Ten Commandments , " Dies sind die heilgen Zehn Gebot " and " Mensch , willst du leben seliglich " . His " Gelobet seist du , Jesu Christ " ( " Praise be to You , Jesus Christ " ) became the main hymn for Christmas . He wrote for Pentecost " Nun bitten wir den Heiligen Geist " , and adopted for Easter " Christ ist erstanden " ( Christ is risen ) , based on Victimae paschali laudes . " Mit Fried und Freud ich fahr dahin " , a paraphrase of Nunc dimittis , was intended for Purification , but became also a funeral hymn . He paraphrased the Te Deum as " Herr Gott , dich loben wir " with a simplified form of the melody . It became known as the German Te Deum .
At a general level , self-psychology is compelled to investigate the question of how the personal self relates to the social environment . To the extent that these theories place themselves in the tradition of " psychological " social psychology , they focus on explaining an individual 's actions within a group in terms of mental events and states . However , some " sociological " social psychology theories go further by attempting to deal with the issue of identity at both the levels of individual cognition and of collective behavior .
Johann Eck , speaking on behalf of the Empire as assistant of the Archbishop of Trier , presented Luther with copies of his writings laid out on a table and asked him if the books were his , and whether he stood by their contents . Luther confirmed he was their author , but requested time to think about the answer to the second question . He prayed , consulted friends , and gave his response the next day :
The negotiations were successfully concluded on 17 February 1546 . After 8 a.m. , he experienced chest pains . When he went to his bed , he prayed , " Into your hand I commit my spirit ; you have redeemed me , O Lord , faithful God " ( Ps . 31:5 ) , the common prayer of the dying . At 1 a.m. he awoke with more chest pain and was warmed with hot towels . He thanked God for revealing his Son to him in whom he had believed . His companions , Justus Jonas and Michael Coelius , shouted loudly , " Reverend father , are you ready to die trusting in your Lord Jesus Christ and to confess the doctrine which you have taught in his name ? " A distinct " Yes " was Luther 's reply .
After a punt from both teams , Carolina got on track with a 9-play , 73-yard scoring drive . Newton completed 4 of 4 passes for 51 yards and rushed twice for 25 yards , while Jonathan Stewart finished the drive with a 1-yard touchdown run , cutting the score to 10–7 with 11:28 left in the second quarter . Later on , Broncos receiver Jordan Norwood received Brad Nortman 's short 28-yard punt surrounded by Panthers players , but none of them attempted to make a tackle , apparently thinking Norwood had called a fair catch . Norwood had not done so , and with no resistance around him , he took off for a Super Bowl record 61-yard return before Mario Addison dragged him down on the Panthers 14-yard line . Despite Denver 's excellent field position , they could not get the ball into the end zone , so McManus kicked a 33-yard field goal that increased their lead to 13–7 .
Contemporary Eastern Orthodox Christians often object to the dogmatic declaration of her immaculate conception as an " over-elaboration " of the faith and because they see it as too closely connected with a particular interpretation of the doctrine of ancestral sin . All the same , the historical and authentic tradition of Mariology in Byzantium took its historical point of departure from Sophronios , Damascene , and their imitators . The most famous Eastern Orthodox theologian to imply Mary 's Immaculate Conception was St. Gregory Palamas . Though many passages from his works were long known to extol and attribute to Mary a Christlike holiness in her human nature , traditional objections to Palamas ' disposition toward the Immaculate Conception typically rely on a poor understanding of his doctrine of " the purification of Mary " at the Annunciation . Not only did he explicitly cite St. Gregory Nazianzen for his understanding of Jesus ' purification at His baptism and Mary 's at the Annunciation , but Theophanes of Nicaea , Joseph Bryennius , and Gennadios Scholarios all explicitly placed Mary 's Conception as the first moment of her all-immaculate participation in the divine energies to such a degree that she was always completely without spot and graced . In addition to Emperor Manuel II and Gennadius Scholarius , St. Mark of Ephesus also fervently defended Mary 's title as " prepurified " against the Dominican , Manuel Calecas , who was perhaps promoting thomistic Mariology that denied Mary 's all-holiness from the first moment of her existence .
Historians estimate that between the advent of Islam in 650CE and the abolition of slavery in the Arabian Peninsula in the mid-20th century , 10 to 18 million sub-Saharan Black Africans were enslaved by Arab slave traders and transported to the Arabian Peninsula and neighboring countries . This number far exceeded the number of slaves who were taken to the Americas . Several factors affected the visibility of descendants of this diaspora in 21st-century Arab societies : The traders shipped more female slaves than males , as there was a demand for them to serve as concubines in harems in the Arabian Peninsula and neighboring countries . Male slaves were castrated in order to serve as harem guards . The death toll of Black African slaves from forced labor was high . The mixed-race children of female slaves and Arab owners were assimilated into the Arab owners ' families under the patrilineal kinship system . As a result , few distinctive Afro-Arab black communities have survived in the Arabian Peninsula and neighboring countries .
UNFPA has been falsely accused by anti-family planning groups of providing support for government programs which have promoted forced-abortions and coercive sterilizations . Controversies regarding these claims have resulted in a sometimes shaky relationship between the organization and three presidential administrations , that of Ronald Reagan , George H. W. Bush and George W. Bush , withholding funding from the UNFPA .
In the post-apartheid era , the Constitution of South Africa has declared the country to be a " Non-racial democracy " . In an effort to redress past injustices , the ANC government has introduced laws in support of affirmative action policies for Blacks ; under these they define " Black " people to include " Africans " , " Coloureds " and " Asians " . Some affirmative action policies favor " Africans " over " Coloureds " in terms of qualifying for certain benefits . Some South Africans categorized as " African Black " say that " Coloureds " did not suffer as much as they did during apartheid . " Coloured " South Africans are known to discuss their dilemma by saying , " we were not white enough under apartheid , and we are not black enough under the ANC ( African National Congress ) " .

From 2002 through 2008 , the Bush Administration denied funding to UNFPA that had already been allocated by the US Congress , partly on the refuted claims that the UNFPA supported Chinese government programs which include forced abortions and coercive sterilizations . In a letter from the Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Nicholas Burns to Congress , the administration said it had determined that UNFPA ’ s support for China ’ s population program “ facilitates ( its ) government ’ s coercive abortion program ” , thus violating the Kemp-Kasten Amendment , which bans the use of United States aid to finance organizations that support or take part in managing a program of coercive abortion of sterilization .
Alan Dershowitz described Sudan as an example of a government that " actually deserve ( s ) " the appellation " apartheid . " Former Canadian Minister of Justice Irwin Cotler echoed the accusation .
In early times , the privilege of papal election was not reserved to the cardinals , and for centuries the person elected was customarily a Roman priest and never a bishop from elsewhere . To preserve apostolic succession the rite of consecrating him a bishop had to be performed by someone who was already a bishop . The rule remains that , if the person elected Pope is not yet a bishop , he is consecrated by the Dean of the College of Cardinals , the Cardinal Bishop of Ostia .
Luther 's final journey , to Mansfeld , was taken because of his concern for his siblings ' families continuing in their father Hans Luther 's copper mining trade . Their livelihood was threatened by Count Albrecht of Mansfeld bringing the industry under his own control . The controversy that ensued involved all four Mansfeld counts : Albrecht , Philip , John George , and Gerhard . Luther journeyed to Mansfeld twice in late 1545 to participate in the negotiations for a settlement , and a third visit was needed in early 1546 for their completion .
On 18 January 2014 , the interim government successfully institutionalised a more secular constitution . The president is elected to a four-year term and may serve 2 terms . The parliament may impeach the president . Under the constitution , there is a guarantee of gender equality and absolute freedom of thought . The military retains the ability to appoint the national Minister of Defence for the next 8 years . Under the constitution , political parties may not be based on " religion , race , gender or geography " .
In the United States , macabre-rock pioneer Alice Cooper achieved mainstream success with the top ten album School 's Out ( 1972 ) . In the following year blues rockers ZZ Top released their classic album Tres Hombres and Aerosmith produced their eponymous début , as did Southern rockers Lynyrd Skynyrd and proto-punk outfit New York Dolls , demonstrating the diverse directions being pursued in the genre . Montrose , including the instrumental talent of Ronnie Montrose and vocals of Sammy Hagar and arguably the first all American hard rock band to challenge the British dominance of the genre , released their first album in 1973 . Kiss built on the theatrics of Alice Cooper and the look of the New York Dolls to produce a unique band persona , achieving their commercial breakthrough with the double live album Alive ! in 1975 and helping to take hard rock into the stadium rock era . In the mid-1970s Aerosmith achieved their commercial and artistic breakthrough with Toys in the Attic ( 1975 ) , which reached number 11 in the American album chart , and Rocks ( 1976 ) , which peaked at number three . Blue Öyster Cult , formed in the late 60s , picked up on some of the elements introduced by Black Sabbath with their breakthrough live gold album On Your Feet or on Your Knees ( 1975 ) , followed by their first platinum album , Agents of Fortune ( 1976 ) , containing the hit single " ( Do n't Fear ) The Reaper " , which reached number 12 on the Billboard charts . Journey released their eponymous debut in 1975 and the next year Boston released their highly successful début album . In the same year , hard rock bands featuring women saw commercial success as Heart released Dreamboat Annie and The Runaways débuted with their self-titled album . While Heart had a more folk-oriented hard rock sound , the Runaways leaned more towards a mix of punk-influenced music and hard rock . The Amboy Dukes , having emerged from the Detroit garage rock scene and most famous for their Top 20 psychedelic hit " Journey to the Center of the Mind " ( 1968 ) , were dissolved by their guitarist Ted Nugent , who embarked on a solo career that resulted in four successive multi-platinum albums between Ted Nugent ( 1975 ) and his best selling Double Live Gonzo ( 1978 ) .
In the new commercial climate glam metal bands like Europe , Ratt , White Lion and Cinderella broke up , Whitesnake went on hiatus in 1991 , and while many of these bands would re-unite again in the late 1990s or early 2000s , they never reached the commercial success they saw in the 1980s or early 1990s . Other bands such as Mötley Crüe and Poison saw personnel changes which impacted those bands ' commercial viability during the decade . In 1995 Van Halen released Balance , a multi-platinum seller that would be the band 's last with Sammy Hagar on vocals . In 1996 David Lee Roth returned briefly and his replacement , former Extreme singer Gary Cherone , was fired soon after the release of the commercially unsuccessful 1998 album Van Halen III and Van Halen would not tour or record again until 2004 . Guns N ' Roses ' original lineup was whittled away throughout the decade . Drummer Steven Adler was fired in 1990 , guitarist Izzy Stradlin left in late 1991 after recording Use Your Illusion I and II with the band . Tensions between the other band members and lead singer Axl Rose continued after the release of the 1993 covers album The Spaghetti Incident ? Guitarist Slash left in 1996 , followed by bassist Duff McKagan in 1997 . Axl Rose , the only original member , worked with a constantly changing lineup in recording an album that would take over fifteen years to complete .
At a general level , self-psychology is compelled to investigate the question of how the personal self relates to the social environment . To the extent that these theories place themselves in the tradition of " psychological " social psychology , they focus on explaining an individual 's actions within a group in terms of mental events and states . However , some " sociological " social psychology theories go further by attempting to deal with the issue of identity at both the levels of individual cognition and of collective behavior .
The flagship stations of each station in the markets of each team will carry their local play-by-play calls . In Denver , KOA ( 850 AM ) and KRFX ( 103.5 FM ) will carry the game , with Dave Logan on play-by-play and Ed McCaffrey on color commentary . In North Carolina , WBT ( 1110 AM ) will carry the game , with Mick Mixon on play-by-play and Eugene Robinson and Jim Szoke on color commentary . WBT will also simulcast the game on its sister station WBT-FM ( 99.3 FM ) , which is based in Chester , South Carolina . As KOA and WBT are both clear-channel stations , the local broadcasts will be audible over much of the western United States after sunset ( for Denver ) and the eastern United States throughout the game ( for Carolina ) . In accordance with contractual rules , the rest of the stations in the Broncos and Panthers radio networks will either carry the Westwood One feed or not carry the game at all .
Virgil 's biographical tradition is thought to depend on a lost biography by Varius , Virgil 's editor , which was incorporated into the biography by Suetonius and the commentaries of Servius and Donatus , the two great commentators on Virgil 's poetry . Although the commentaries no doubt record much factual information about Virgil , some of their evidence can be shown to rely on inferences made from his poetry and allegorizing ; thus , Virgil 's biographical tradition remains problematic .
The Lutheran theologian Franz Pieper observed that Luther 's teaching about the state of the Christian 's soul after death differed from the later Lutheran theologians such as Johann Gerhard . Lessing ( 1755 ) had earlier reached the same conclusion in his analysis of Lutheran orthodoxy on this issue .
While these few hard rock bands managed to maintain success and popularity in the early part of the decade , alternative forms of hard rock achieved mainstream success in the form of grunge in the US and Britpop in the UK . This was particularly evident after the success of Nirvana 's Nevermind ( 1991 ) , which combined elements of hardcore punk and heavy metal into a " dirty " sound that made use of heavy guitar distortion , fuzz and feedback , along with darker lyrical themes than their " hair band " predecessors . Although most grunge bands had a sound that sharply contrasted mainstream hard rock , several , including Pearl Jam , Alice in Chains , Mother Love Bone and Soundgarden , were more strongly influenced by 1970s and 1980s rock and metal , while Stone Temple Pilots managed to turn alternative rock into a form of stadium rock . However , all grunge bands shunned the macho , anthemic and fashion-focused aesthetics particularly associated with glam metal . In the UK , Oasis were unusual among the Britpop bands of the mid-1990s in incorporating a hard rock sound .
Foreign direct investment ( FDI ) in Egypt increased considerably before the removal of Hosni Mubarak , exceeding $ 6 billion in 2006 , due to economic liberalisation and privatisation measures taken by minister of investment Mahmoud Mohieddin . [ citation needed ] Since the fall of Hosni Mubarak in 2011 , Egypt has experienced a drastic fall in both foreign investment and tourism revenues , followed by a 60 % drop in foreign exchange reserves , a 3 % drop in growth , and a rapid devaluation of the Egyptian pound .
The Broncos defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers in the divisional round , 23–16 , by scoring 11 points in the final three minutes of the game . They then beat the defending Super Bowl XLIX champion New England Patriots in the AFC Championship Game , 20–18 , by intercepting a pass on New England 's 2-point conversion attempt with 17 seconds left on the clock . Despite Manning 's problems with interceptions during the season , he did n't throw any in their two playoff games .
On the island of Crete , along with the lyra and the laouto ( lute ) , the mandolin is one of the main instruments used in Cretan Music . It appeared on Crete around the time of the Venetian rule of the island . Different variants of the mandolin , such as the " mantola , " were used to accompany the lyra , the violin , and the laouto . Stelios Foustalierakis reported that the mandolin and the mpoulgari were used to accompany the lyra in the beginning of the 20th century in the city of Rethimno . There are also reports that the mandolin was mostly a woman 's musical instrument . Nowadays it is played mainly as a solo instrument in personal and family events on the Ionian islands and Crete .
President Bush denied funding to the UNFPA . Over the course of the Bush Administration , a total of $ 244 million in Congressionally approved funding was blocked by the Executive Branch .
Pennies and other small coins are sometimes ingested by dogs , resulting in the need for medical treatment to remove the foreign body . The zinc content of some coins can cause zinc toxicity , which is commonly fatal in dogs , where it causes a severe hemolytic anemia , and also liver or kidney damage ; vomiting and diarrhea are possible symptoms . Zinc is highly toxic in parrots and poisoning can often be fatal . The consumption of fruit juices stored in galvanized cans has resulted in mass parrot poisonings with zinc .
The Aeneid appears to have been a great success . Virgil is said to have recited Books 2 , 4 , and 6 to Augustus ; and Book 6 apparently caused Augustus ' sister Octavia to faint . Although the truth of this claim is subject to scholarly scepticism , it has served as a basis for later art , such as Jean-Baptiste Wicar 's Virgil Reading the Aeneid .
In October 1529 , Philip I , Landgrave of Hesse , convoked an assembly of German and Swiss theologians at the Marburg Colloquy , to establish doctrinal unity in the emerging Protestant states . Agreement was achieved on fourteen points out of fifteen , the exception being the nature of the Eucharist – the sacrament of the Lord 's Supper—an issue crucial to Luther .

He insisted that , since forgiveness was God 's alone to grant , those who claimed that indulgences absolved buyers from all punishments and granted them salvation were in error . Christians , he said , must not slacken in following Christ on account of such false assurances .
Distinctive and self-identified black communities have been reported in countries such as Iraq , with a reported 1.2 million black people , and they attest to a history of discrimination . African-Iraquis have sought minority status from the government , which would reserve some seats in Parliament for representatives of their population . According to Alamin M. Mazrui et al. , generally in the Arabian Peninsula and neighboring countries , most of those of visible African descent are still classified and identify as Arab , not black .
World War I was a watershed event in human history , changing views of governments and politics . The Russian Revolution of 1917 ( and similar , albeit less successful , revolutions in many other European countries ) brought communism - and in particular the political theory of Leninism , but also on a smaller level Luxemburgism ( gradually ) - on the world stage . At the same time , social democratic parties won elections and formed governments for the first time , often as a result of the introduction of universal suffrage . However , a group of central European economists led by Austrian School economists Ludwig von Mises and Friedrich Hayek identified the collectivist underpinnings to the various new socialist and fascist doctrines of government power as being different brands of political totalitarianism .
In the 1980s to early 1990s , there was a CBS imprint label in the US known as CBS Associated Records . Tony Martell , veteran CBS and Epic Records A & R Vice President was head of this label and signed artists including Ozzy Osbourne , the Fabulous Thunderbirds , Electric Light Orchestra , Joan Jett , and Henry Lee Summer . This label was a part of ( Epic/Portrait/Associated ) wing of sub labels at CBS which shared the same national and regional staff as the rest of Epic Records and was a part of the full CBS Records worldwide distribution system .
This was the first Super Bowl to feature a quarterback on both teams who was the # 1 pick in their draft classes . Manning was the # 1 selection of the 1998 NFL draft , while Newton was picked first in 2011 . The matchup also pits the top two picks of the 2011 draft against each other : Newton for Carolina and Von Miller for Denver . Manning and Newton also set the record for the largest age difference between opposing Super Bowl quarterbacks at 13 years and 48 days ( Manning was 39 , Newton was 26 ) .
The Suez Canal , built in partnership with the French , was completed in 1869 . Its construction led to enormous debt to European banks , and caused popular discontent because of the onerous taxation it required . In 1875 Ismail was forced to sell Egypt 's share in the canal to the British Government . Within three years this led to the imposition of British and French controllers who sat in the Egyptian cabinet , and , " with the financial power of the bondholders behind them , were the real power in the Government . "
With the rise of disco in the US and punk rock in the UK , hard rock 's mainstream dominance was rivalled toward the later part of the decade . Disco appealed to a more diverse group of people and punk seemed to take over the rebellious role that hard rock once held . Early punk bands like The Ramones explicitly rebelled against the drum solos and extended guitar solos that characterised stadium rock , with almost all of their songs clocking in around two minutes with no guitar solos . However , new rock acts continued to emerge and record sales remained high into the 1980s . 1977 saw the début and rise to stardom of Foreigner , who went on to release several platinum albums through to the mid-1980s . Midwestern groups like Kansas , REO Speedwagon and Styx helped further cement heavy rock in the Midwest as a form of stadium rock . In 1978 , Van Halen emerged from the Los Angeles music scene with a sound based around the skills of lead guitarist Eddie Van Halen . He popularised a guitar-playing technique of two-handed hammer-ons and pull-offs called tapping , showcased on the song " Eruption " from the album Van Halen , which was highly influential in re-establishing hard rock as a popular genre after the punk and disco explosion , while also redefining and elevating the role of electric guitar .
Egyptian cinema became a regional force with the coming of sound . In 1936 , Studio Misr , financed by industrialist Talaat Harb , emerged as the leading Egyptian studio , a role the company retained for three decades . For over 100 years , more than 4000 films have been produced in Egypt , three quarters of the total Arab production . [ citation needed ] Egypt is considered the leading country in the field of cinema in the Middle East . Actors from all over the Arab World seek to appear in the Egyptian cinema for the sake of fame . The Cairo International Film Festival has been rated as one of 11 festivals with a top class rating worldwide by the International Federation of Film Producers ' Associations .
Phil Skinner played a key role in 20th century development of the mandolin movement in Australia , and was awarded an MBE in 1979 for services to music and the community . He was born Harry Skinner in Sydney in 1903 and started learning music at age 10 when his uncle tutored him on the banjo . Skinner began teaching part-time at age 18 , until the Great Depression forced him to begin teaching full-time and learn a broader range of instruments . Skinner founded the Sydney Mandolin Orchestra , the oldest surviving mandolin orchestra in Australia .
Zinc is included in most single tablet over-the-counter daily vitamin and mineral supplements . Preparations include zinc oxide , zinc acetate , and zinc gluconate . It is believed to possess antioxidant properties , which may protect against accelerated aging of the skin and muscles of the body ; studies differ as to its effectiveness . Zinc also helps speed up the healing process after an injury . It is also suspected of being beneficial to the body 's immune system . Indeed , zinc deficiency may have effects on virtually all parts of the human immune system .
Even as the Western Roman empire collapsed , literate men acknowledged that Virgil was a master poet . Gregory of Tours read Virgil , whom he quotes in several places , along with some other Latin poets , though he cautions that " we ought not to relate their lying fables , lest we fall under sentence of eternal death . "
Egypt has one of the longest histories of any modern country , arising in the tenth millennium BC as one of the world 's first nation states . Considered a cradle of civilisation , Ancient Egypt experienced some of the earliest developments of writing , agriculture , urbanisation , organised religion and central government . Iconic monuments such as the Giza Necropolis and its Great Sphinx , as well the ruins of Memphis , Thebes , Karnak , and the Valley of the Kings , reflect this legacy and remain a significant focus of archaeological study and popular interest worldwide . Egypt 's rich cultural heritage is an integral part of its national identity , having endured , and at times assimilated , various foreign influences , including Greek , Persian , Roman , Arab , Ottoman , and European . Although Christianised in the first century of the Common Era , it was subsequently Islamised due to the Islamic conquests of the seventh century .
The instrument was primarily used in an ensemble setting well into the 1930s , and although the fad died out at the beginning of the 1930s , the instruments that were developed for the orchestra found a new home in bluegrass . The famous Lloyd Loar Master Model from Gibson ( 1923 ) was designed to boost the flagging interest in mandolin ensembles , with little success . However , The " Loar " became the defining instrument of bluegrass music when Bill Monroe purchased F-5 S/N 73987 in a Florida barbershop in 1943 and popularized it as his main instrument .
Many people gain a sense of positive self-esteem from their identity groups , which furthers a sense of community and belonging . Another issue that researchers have attempted to address is the question of why people engage in discrimination , i.e. , why they tend to favor those they consider a part of their " in-group " over those considered to be outsiders . Both questions have been given extensive attention by researchers working in the social identity tradition . For example , in work relating to social identity theory it has been shown that merely crafting cognitive distinction between in- and out-groups can lead to subtle effects on people 's evaluations of others ( Cote & Levine 2002 ) .
Indian political philosophy evolved in ancient times and demarcated a clear distinction between ( 1 ) nation and state ( 2 ) religion and state . The constitutions of Hindu states evolved over time and were based on political and legal treatises and prevalent social institutions . The institutions of state were broadly divided into governance , administration , defense , law and order . Mantranga , the principal governing body of these states , consisted of the King , Prime Minister , Commander in chief of army , Chief Priest of the King . The Prime Minister headed the committee of ministers along with head of executive ( Maha Amatya ) .
Being identified as either " black " or " white " in Australia during the 19th and early 20th centuries was critical in one 's employment and social prospects . Various state-based Aboriginal Protection Boards were established which had virtually complete control over the lives of Indigenous Australians – where they lived , their employment , marriage , education and included the power to separate children from their parents . Aborigines were not allowed to vote and were often confined to reserves and forced into low paid or effectively slave labour . The social position of mixed-race or " half-caste " individuals varied over time . A 1913 report by Sir Baldwin Spencer states that :

Controversies regarding these claims have resulted in a sometimes shaky relationship between the organization and three presidential administrations , that of Ronald Reagan , George H. W. Bush and George W. Bush , withholding funding from the UNFPA .
In accordance with his father 's wishes , Luther enrolled in law school at the same university that year but dropped out almost immediately , believing that law represented uncertainty . Luther sought assurances about life and was drawn to theology and philosophy , expressing particular interest in Aristotle , William of Ockham , and Gabriel Biel . He was deeply influenced by two tutors , Bartholomaeus Arnoldi von Usingen and Jodocus Trutfetter , who taught him to be suspicious of even the greatest thinkers and to test everything himself by experience . Philosophy proved to be unsatisfying , offering assurance about the use of reason but none about loving God , which to Luther was more important . Reason could not lead men to God , he felt , and he thereafter developed a love-hate relationship with Aristotle over the latter 's emphasis on reason . For Luther , reason could be used to question men and institutions , but not God . Human beings could learn about God only through divine revelation , he believed , and Scripture therefore became increasingly important to him .
There are many important organozinc compounds . Organozinc chemistry is the science of organozinc compounds describing their physical properties , synthesis and reactions . Among important applications is the Frankland-Duppa Reaction in which an oxalate ester ( ROCOCOOR ) reacts with an alkyl halide R'X , zinc and hydrochloric acid to the α-hydroxycarboxylic esters RR'COHCOOR , the Reformatskii reaction which converts α-halo-esters and aldehydes to β-hydroxy-esters , the Simmons–Smith reaction in which the carbenoid ( iodomethyl ) zinc iodide reacts with alkene ( or alkyne ) and converts them to cyclopropane , the Addition reaction of organozinc compounds to carbonyl compounds . The Barbier reaction ( 1899 ) is the zinc equivalent of the magnesium Grignard reaction and is better of the two . In presence of just about any water the formation of the organomagnesium halide will fail , whereas the Barbier reaction can even take place in water . On the downside organozincs are much less nucleophilic than Grignards , are expensive and difficult to handle . Commercially available diorganozinc compounds are dimethylzinc , diethylzinc and diphenylzinc . In one study the active organozinc compound is obtained from much cheaper organobromine precursors :
Further claims were made that the Roman Catholic Church derives its doctrine from the Islamic teaching . In volume 5 of his Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire , published in 1788 , Edward Gibbon wrote : " The Latin Church has not disdained to borrow from the Koran the immaculate conception of his virgin mother . " That he was speaking of her immaculate conception by her mother , not of her own virginal conception of Jesus , is shown by his footnote : " In the xiith century the immaculate conception was condemned by St. Bernard as a presumptuous novelty . " In the aftermath of the definition of the dogma in 1854 , this charge was repeated : " Strange as it may appear , that the doctrine which the church of Rome has promulgated , with so much pomp and ceremony , 'for the destruction of all heresies , and the confirmation of the faith of her adherents ' , should have its origin in the Mohametan Bible ; yet the testimony of such authorities as Gibbon , and Sale , and Forster , and Gagnier , and Maracci , leave no doubt as to the marvellous fact . "
By 1526 , Luther found himself increasingly occupied in organising a new church . His Biblical ideal of congregations ' choosing their own ministers had proved unworkable . According to Bainton : " Luther 's dilemma was that he wanted both a confessional church based on personal faith and experience and a territorial church including all in a given locality . If he were forced to choose , he would take his stand with the masses , and this was the direction in which he moved . " From 1525 to 1529 , he established a supervisory church body , laid down a new form of worship service , and wrote a clear summary of the new faith in the form of two catechisms . Luther 's thought is revolutionary to the extent that it is a theology of the cross , the negation of every affirmation : as long as the cross is at the center , the system building tendency of reason is held in check , and system building does not degenerate into System .
BSkyB 's digital service was officially launched on 1 October 1998 under the name Sky Digital , although small-scale tests were carried out before then . At this time the use of the Sky Digital brand made an important distinction between the new service and Sky 's analogue services . Key selling points were the improvement in picture and sound quality , increased number of channels and an interactive service branded Open ... . now called Sky Active , BSkyB competed with the ONdigital ( later ITV Digital ) terrestrial offering and cable services . Within 30 days , over 100,000 digiboxes had been sold , which help bolstered BSkyB 's decision to give away free digiboxes and minidishes from May 1999 .
Some rock musicians today use mandolins , often single-stringed electric models rather than double-stringed acoustic mandolins . One example is Tim Brennan of the Irish-American punk rock band Dropkick Murphys . In addition to electric guitar , bass , and drums , the band uses several instruments associated with traditional Celtic music , including mandolin , tin whistle , and Great Highland bagpipes . The band explains that these instruments accentuate the growling sound they favor . The 1991 R.E.M . hit " Losing My Religion " was driven by a few simple mandolin licks played by guitarist Peter Buck , who also played the mandolin in nearly a dozen other songs . The single peaked at No . 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart ( # 1 on the rock and alternative charts ) , Luther Dickinson of North Mississippi Allstars and The Black Crowes has made frequent use of the mandolin , most notably on the Black Crowes song " Locust Street . " Armenian American rock group System of A Down makes extensive use of the mandolin on their 2005 double album Mezmerize/Hypnotize . Pop punk band Green Day has used a mandolin in several occasions , especially on their 2000 album , Warning . Boyd Tinsley , violin player of the Dave Matthews Band has been using an electric mandolin since 2005 . Frontman Colin Meloy and guitarist Chris Funk of The Decemberists regularly employ the mandolin in the band 's music . Nancy Wilson , rhythm guitarist of Heart , uses a mandolin in Heart 's song " Dream of the Archer " from the album Little Queen , as well as in Heart 's cover of Led Zeppelin 's song " The Battle of Evermore . " " Show Me Heaven " by Maria McKee , the theme song to the film Days of Thunder , prominently features a mandolin .
In the US , African Americans , who include multiracial people , earn 75 % of what white people earn . In Brazil , people of color earn less than 50 % of what whites earn . Some have posited that the facts of lower socioeconomic status for people of color suggest that Brazil practices a kind of one-drop rule , or discrimination against people who are not visibly European in ancestry . The gap in income between blacks and other non-whites is relatively small compared to the large gap between whites and all people of color . Other social factors , such as illiteracy and education levels , show the same patterns of disadvantage for people of color . Some commentators observe that the United States practice of segregation and white supremacy in the South , and discrimination in many areas outside that region , forced many African Americans to unite in the civil rights struggle . They suggest that the fluid nature of race in Brazil has divided individuals of African descent , between those with more or less ancestry . As a result , they have not united for a stronger civil rights movement . [ citation needed ]
On 8 February 2007 , BSkyB announced its intention to replace its three free-to-air digital terrestrial channels with four subscription channels . It was proposed that these channels would offer a range of content from the BSkyB portfolio including sport ( including English Premier League Football ) , films , entertainment and news . The announcement came a day after Setanta Sports confirmed that it would launch in March as a subscription service on the digital terrestrial platform , and on the same day that NTL 's services re-branded as Virgin Media . However , industry sources believe BSkyB will be forced to shelve plans to withdraw its channels from Freeview and replace them with subscription channels , due to possible lost advertising revenue .
Denver took the opening kickoff and started out strong with Peyton Manning completing an 18-yard pass to tight end Owen Daniels and a 22-yard throw to receiver Andre Caldwell . A pair of carries by C. J. Anderson moved the ball up 20 yards to the Panthers 14-yard line , but Carolina 's defense dug in over the next three plays . First , linebacker Shaq Thompson tackled Ronnie Hillman for a 3-yard loss . Then after an incompletion , Thomas Davis tackled Anderson for a 1-yard gain on third down , forcing Denver to settle for a 3–0 lead on a Brandon McManus 34-yard field goal . The score marked the first time in the entire postseason that Carolina was facing a deficit .
These theorists were driven by two basic questions : one , by what right or need do people form states ; and two , what the best form for a state could be . These fundamental questions involved a conceptual distinction between the concepts of " state " and " government . " It was decided that " state " would refer to a set of enduring institutions through which power would be distributed and its use justified . The term " government " would refer to a specific group of people who occupied the institutions of the state , and create the laws and ordinances by which the people , themselves included , would be bound . This conceptual distinction continues to operate in political science , although some political scientists , philosophers , historians and cultural anthropologists have argued that most political action in any given society occurs outside of its state , and that there are societies that are not organized into states that nevertheless must be considered in political terms . As long as the concept of natural order was not introduced , the social sciences could not evolve independently of theistic thinking . Since the cultural revolution of the 17th century in England , which spread to France and the rest of Europe , society has been considered subject to natural laws akin to the physical world .
These different explorations of 'identity ' demonstrate how difficult a concept it is to pin down . Since identity is a virtual thing , it is impossible to define it empirically . Discussions of identity use the term with different meanings , from fundamental and abiding sameness , to fluidity , contingency , negotiated and so on . Brubaker and Cooper note a tendency in many scholars to confuse identity as a category of practice and as a category of analysis ( Brubaker & Cooper 2000 , p. 5 ) . Indeed , many scholars demonstrate a tendency to follow their own preconceptions of identity , following more or less the frameworks listed above , rather than taking into account the mechanisms by which the concept is crystallised as reality . In this environment , some analysts , such as Brubaker and Cooper , have suggested doing away with the concept completely ( Brubaker & Cooper 2000 , p. 1 ) . Others , by contrast , have sought to introduce alternative concepts in an attempt to capture the dynamic and fluid qualities of human social self-expression . Hall ( 1992 , 1996 ) , for example , suggests treating identity as a process , to take into account the reality of diverse and ever-changing social experience . Some scholars have introduced the idea of identification , whereby identity is perceived as made up of different components that are 'identified ' and interpreted by individuals . The construction of an individual sense of self is achieved by personal choices regarding who and what to associate with . Such approaches are liberating in their recognition of the role of the individual in social interaction and the construction of identity .
The Fund raises awareness of and supports efforts to meet these needs in developing countries , advocates close attention to population concerns , and helps developing nations formulate policies and strategies in support of sustainable development . Dr. Osotimehin assumed leadership in January 2011 . The Fund is also represented by UNFPA Goodwill Ambassadors and a Patron .
Concerns were raised over whether Levi 's Stadium 's field was of a high enough quality to host a Super Bowl ; during the inaugural season , the field had to be re-sodded multiple times due to various issues , and during a week 6 game earlier in the 2015 season , a portion of the turf collapsed under Baltimore Ravens kicker Justin Tucker , causing him to slip and miss a field goal , although the field has not had any major issues since . As is customary for Super Bowl games played at natural grass stadiums , the NFL re-sodded the field with a new playing surface ; a hybrid Bermuda 419 turf . NFL and Atlanta Braves field director Ed Mangan stated that the field was in " great shape " for gameday . However , the turf showed problem throughout the game , with a number of players needing to change their cleats during the game and player slipping during plays all throughout the game .
There is evidence of induced copper deficiency in those taking 100–300 mg of zinc daily . A 2007 trial observed that elderly men taking 80 mg daily were hospitalized for urinary complications more often than those taking a placebo . The USDA RDA is 11 and 8 mg Zn/day for men and women , respectively . Levels of 100–300 mg may interfere with the utilization of copper and iron or adversely affect cholesterol . Levels of zinc in excess of 500 ppm in soil interfere with the ability of plants to absorb other essential metals , such as iron and manganese . There is also a condition called the zinc shakes or " zinc chills " that can be induced by the inhalation of freshly formed zinc oxide formed during the welding of galvanized materials . Zinc is a common ingredient of denture cream which may contain between 17 and 38 mg of zinc per gram . There have been claims of disability , and even death , due to excessive use of these products .
In 1542 , Luther read a Latin translation of the Qur'an . He went on to produce several critical pamphlets on Islam , which he called " Mohammedanism " or " the Turk " . Though Luther saw the Muslim faith as a tool of the devil , he was indifferent to its practice : " Let the Turk believe and live as he will , just as one lets the papacy and other false Christians live . " He opposed banning the publication of the Qur'an , wanting it exposed to scrutiny .
The international repertoire of music for mandolin is almost unlimited , and musicians use it to play various types of music . This is especially true of violin music , since the mandolin has the same tuning of the violin . Following its invention and early development in Italy the mandolin spread throughout the European continent . The instrument was primarily used in a classical tradition with Mandolin orchestras , so called Estudiantinas or in Germany Zupforchestern appearing in many cities . Following this continental popularity of the mandolin family local traditions appeared outside of Europe in the Americas and in Japan . Travelling mandolin virtuosi like Giuseppe Pettine , Raffaele Calace and Silvio Ranieri contributed to the mandolin becoming a " fad " instrument in the early 20th century . This " mandolin craze " was fading by the 1930s , but just as this practice was falling into disuse , the mandolin found a new niche in American country , old-time music , bluegrass and folk music . More recently , the Baroque and Classical mandolin repertory and styles have benefited from the raised awareness of and interest in Early music , with media attention to classical players such as Israeli Avi Avital , Italian Carlo Aonzo and American Joseph Brent .
The Panthers defense gave up just 308 points , ranking sixth in the league , while also leading the NFL in interceptions with 24 and boasting four Pro Bowl selections . Pro Bowl defensive tackle Kawann Short led the team in sacks with 11 , while also forcing three fumbles and recovering two . Fellow lineman Mario Addison added 6½ sacks . The Panthers line also featured veteran defensive end Jared Allen , a 5-time pro bowler who was the NFL 's active career sack leader with 136 , along with defensive end Kony Ealy , who had 5 sacks in just 9 starts . Behind them , two of the Panthers three starting linebackers were also selected to play in the Pro Bowl : Thomas Davis and Luke Kuechly . Davis compiled 5½ sacks , four forced fumbles , and four interceptions , while Kuechly led the team in tackles ( 118 ) forced two fumbles , and intercepted four passes of his own . Carolina 's secondary featured Pro Bowl safety Kurt Coleman , who led the team with a career high seven interceptions , while also racking up 88 tackles and Pro Bowl cornerback Josh Norman , who developed into a shutdown corner during the season and had four interceptions , two of which were returned for touchdowns .
Anthropologists have contributed to the debate by shifting the focus of research : One of the first challenges for the researcher wishing to carry out empirical research in this area is to identify an appropriate analytical tool . The concept of boundaries is useful here for demonstrating how identity works . In the same way as Barth , in his approach to ethnicity , advocated the critical focus for investigation as being " the ethnic boundary that defines the group rather than the cultural stuff that it encloses " ( 1969:15 ) , social anthropologists such as Cohen and Bray have shifted the focus of analytical study from identity to the boundaries that are used for purposes of identification . If identity is a kind of virtual site in which the dynamic processes and markers used for identification are made apparent , boundaries provide the framework on which this virtual site is built . They concentrated on how the idea of community belonging is differently constructed by individual members and how individuals within the group conceive ethnic boundaries .
In 1988 , the civil rights leader Jesse Jackson urged Americans to use instead the term " African American " because it had a historical cultural base and was a construction similar to terms used by European descendants , such as German American , Italian American , etc . Since then , African American and black have often had parallel status . However , controversy continues over which if any of the two terms is more appropriate . Maulana Karenga argues that the term African-American is more appropriate because it accurately articulates their geographical and historical origin . [ citation needed ] Others have argued that " black " is a better term because " African " suggests foreignness , although Black Americans helped found the United States . Still others believe that the term black is inaccurate because African Americans have a variety of skin tones . Some surveys suggest that the majority of Black Americans have no preference for " African American " or " Black " , although they have a slight preference for " black " in personal settings and " African American " in more formal settings .
This nationwide acceptance and recognition of Aboriginal people led to a significant increase in the number of people self-identifying as Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander . The reappropriation of the term " black " with a positive and more inclusive meaning has resulted in its widespread use in mainstream Australian culture , including public media outlets , government agencies , and private companies . In 2012 , a number of high-profile cases highlighted the legal and community attitude that identifying as Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander is not dependent on skin colour , with a well-known boxer Anthony Mundine being widely criticised for questioning the " blackness " of another boxer and journalist Andrew Bolt being successfully sued for publishing discriminatory comments about Aboriginals with light skin .
Brass , which is an alloy of copper and zinc , has been used since at least the 10th century BC in Judea and by the 7th century BC in Ancient Greece . Zinc metal was not produced on a large scale until the 12th century in India and was unknown to Europe until the end of the 16th century . The mines of Rajasthan have given definite evidence of zinc production going back to the 6th century BC . To date , the oldest evidence of pure zinc comes from Zawar , in Rajasthan , as early as the 9th century AD when a distillation process was employed to make pure zinc . Alchemists burned zinc in air to form what they called " philosopher 's wool " or " white snow " .
By 1987 , CBS was the only " big three " American TV network to have a co-owned record company . ABC had sold its record division to MCA Records in 1979 , and in 1986 , NBC 's parent company RCA was sold to General Electric , who then sold off all other RCA units , including the record division ( which was bought by Ariola Records , later known as BMG ) .
The city was originally built on a hilly peninsula surrounded by the River Aare , but outgrew natural boundaries by the 19th century . A number of bridges have been built to allow the city to expand beyond the Aare .
There are seven suburbicarian sees : Ostia , Albano , Porto and Santa Rufina , Palestrina , Sabina and Mentana , Frascati and Velletri . Velletri was united with Ostia from 1150 until 1914 , when Pope Pius X separated them again , but decreed that whatever cardinal bishop became Dean of the College of Cardinals would keep the suburbicarian see he already held , adding to it that of Ostia , with the result that there continued to be only six cardinal bishops .
Because of the acceptance of miscegenation , Brazil has avoided the binary polarization of society into black and white . In addition , it abolished slavery without a civil war . The bitter and sometimes violent racial tensions that have divided the US are notably absent in Brazil . According to the 2010 census , 6.7 % of Brazilians said they were black , compared with 6.2 % in 2000 , and 43.1 % said they were racially mixed , up from 38.5 % . In 2010 , Elio Ferreira de Araujo , Brazil 's minister for racial equality , attributed the increases to growing pride among his country 's black and indigenous communities .

Following their loss in the divisional round of the previous season 's playoffs , the Denver Broncos underwent numerous coaching changes , including a mutual parting with head coach John Fox ( who had won four divisional championships in his four years as Broncos head coach ) , and the hiring of Gary Kubiak as the new head coach . Under Kubiak , the Broncos planned to install a run-oriented offense with zone blocking to blend in with quarterback Peyton Manning 's shotgun passing skills , but struggled with numerous changes and injuries to the offensive line , as well as Manning having his worst statistical season since his rookie year with the Indianapolis Colts in 1998 , due to a plantar fasciitis injury in his heel that he had suffered since the summer , and the simple fact that Manning was getting old , as he turned 39 in the 2015 off-season . Although the team had a 7–0 start , Manning led the NFL in interceptions . In week 10 , Manning suffered a partial tear of the plantar fasciitis in his left foot . He set the NFL 's all-time record for career passing yards in this game , but was benched after throwing four interceptions in favor of backup quarterback Brock Osweiler , who took over as the starter for most of the remainder of the regular season . Osweiler was injured , however , leading to Manning 's return during the Week 17 regular season finale , where the Broncos were losing 13–7 against the 4–11 San Diego Chargers , resulting in Manning re-claiming the starting quarterback position for the playoffs by leading the team to a key 27–20 win that enabled the team to clinch the number one overall AFC seed . Under defensive coordinator Wade Phillips , the Broncos ' defense ranked number one in total yards allowed , passing yards allowed and sacks , and like the previous three seasons , the team has continued to set numerous individual , league and franchise records . With the defense carrying the team despite the issues with the offense , the Broncos finished the regular season with a 12–4 record and earned home-field advantage throughout the AFC playoffs .
On 18 January 2014 , the interim government instituted a new constitution following a referendum in which 98.1 % of voters were supportive . Participation was low with only 38.6 % of registered voters participating although this was higher than the 33 % who voted in a referendum during Morsi 's tenure . On 26 March 2014 Abdel Fattah el-Sisi the head of the Egyptian Armed Forces , who at this time was in control of the country , resigned from the military , announcing he would stand as a candidate in the 2014 presidential election . The poll , held between 26 and 28 May 2014 , resulted in a landslide victory for el-Sisi . Sisi was sworn into office as President of Egypt on 8 June 2014 . The Muslim Brotherhood and some liberal and secular activist groups boycotted the vote . Even though the military-backed authorities extended voting to a third day , the 46 % turnout was lower than the 52 % turnout in the 2012 election .
On 28 February 1476 , Pope Sixtus IV , authorized those dioceses that wished to introduce the feast to do so , and introduced it to his own diocese of Rome in 1477 , with a specially composed Mass and Office of the feast . With his bull Cum praeexcelsa of 28 February 1477 , in which he referred to the feast as that of the Conception of Mary , without using the word " Immaculate " , he granted indulgences to those who would participate in the specially composed Mass or Office on the feast itself or during its octave , and he used the word " immaculate " of Mary , but applied instead the adjective " miraculous " to her conception . On 4 September 1483 , referring to the feast as that of " the Conception of Immaculate Mary ever Virgin " , he condemned both those who called it mortally sinful and heretical to hold that the " glorious and immaculate mother of God was conceived without the stain of original sin " and those who called it mortally sinful and heretical to hold that " the glorious Virgin Mary was conceived with original sin " , since , he said , " up to this time there has been no decision made by the Roman Church and the Apostolic See . " This decree was reaffirmed by the Council of Trent .
Mandolin awareness in the United States blossomed in the 1880s , as the instrument became part of a fad that continued into the mid-1920s . According to Clarence L. Partee , the first mandolin made in the United States was made in 1883 or 1884 by Joseph Bohmann , who was an established maker of violins in Chicago . Partee characterized the early instrument as being larger than the European instruments he was used to , with a " peculiar shape " and " crude construction , " and said that the quality improved , until American instruments were " superior " to imported instruments . At the time , Partee was using an imported French-made mandolin .

In October 1529 , Philip I , Landgrave of Hesse , convoked an assembly of German and Swiss theologians at the Marburg Colloquy , to establish doctrinal unity in the emerging Protestant states . Agreement was achieved on fourteen points out of fifteen , the exception being the nature of the Eucharist – the sacrament of the Lord 's Supper—an issue crucial to Luther .
Luther 's hymns were included in early Lutheran hymnals and spread the ideas of the Reformation . He supplied four of eight songs of the First Lutheran hymnal Achtliederbuch , 18 of 26 songs of the Erfurt Enchiridion , and 24 of the 32 songs in the first choral hymnal with settings by Johann Walter , Eyn geystlich Gesangk Buchleyn , all published in 1524 .
Luther secretly returned to Wittenberg on 6 March 1522 . He wrote to the Elector : " During my absence , Satan has entered my sheepfold , and committed ravages which I can not repair by writing , but only by my personal presence and living word . " For eight days in Lent , beginning on Invocavit Sunday , 9 March , Luther preached eight sermons , which became known as the " Invocavit Sermons " . In these sermons , he hammered home the primacy of core Christian values such as love , patience , charity , and freedom , and reminded the citizens to trust God 's word rather than violence to bring about necessary change .
UNFPA provided aid to Peru 's reproductive health program in the mid-to-late '90s . When it was discovered a Peruvian program had been engaged in carrying out coercive sterilizations , UNFPA called for reforms and protocols to protect the rights of women seeking assistance . UNFPA was not involved in the scandal , but continued work with the country after the abuses had become public to help end the abuses and reform laws and practices .

Zinc is an essential mineral perceived by the public today as being of " exceptional biologic and public health importance " , especially regarding prenatal and postnatal development . Zinc deficiency affects about two billion people in the developing world and is associated with many diseases . In children it causes growth retardation , delayed sexual maturation , infection susceptibility , and diarrhea . Enzymes with a zinc atom in the reactive center are widespread in biochemistry , such as alcohol dehydrogenase in humans . Consumption of excess zinc can cause ataxia , lethargy and copper deficiency .
In the year 1563 the influential Ecumenical Council of Trent , headed by Pope Pius IV , wrote about the importance of selecting good Cardinals . According to this historic council " nothing is more necessary to the Church of God than that the holy Roman pontiff apply that solicitude which by the duty of his office he owes the universal Church in a very special way by associating with himself as cardinals the most select persons only , and appoint to each church most eminently upright and competent shepherds ; and this the more so , because our Lord Jesus Christ will require at his hands the blood of the sheep of Christ that perish through the evil government of shepherds who are negligent and forgetful of their office . "

Beginning with the Paris Exposition of 1878 , the instrument 's popularity rebounded . The Exposition was one of many stops for a popular new performing group the Estudiantes Españoles ( Spanish Students ) . They danced and played guitars , violins and the bandurria , which became confused with the mandolin . Along with the energy and awareness created by the day 's hit sensation , a wave of Italian mandolinists travelled Europe in the 1880s and 1890s and in the United States by the mid-1880s , playing and teaching their instrument . The instrument 's popularity continued to increase during the 1890s and mandolin popularity was at its height in " early years of the 20th century . " Thousands were taking up the instrument as a pastime , and it became an instrument of society , taken up by young men and women . Mandolin orchestras were formed worldwide , incorporating not only the mandolin family of instruments , but also guitars , double basses and zithers .
Numerous modern mandolin makers build instruments that largely replicate the Gibson F-5 Artist models built in the early 1920s under the supervision of Gibson acoustician Lloyd Loar . Original Loar-signed instruments are sought after and extremely valuable . Other makers from the Loar period and earlier include Lyon and Healy , Vega and Larson Brothers . Some notable modern American carved mandolin manufacturers include , in addition to Kay , Gibson , Weber , Monteleone and Collings . Mandolins from other countries include The Loar ( China ) , Santa , Rosa ( China ) , Michael Kelly ( Korea ) , Eastman ( China ) , Kentucky ( China ) , Heiden ( Canada ) , Gilchrist ( Australia ) and Morgan Monroe ( China ) .
Pope Leo X was used to reformers and heretics , and he responded slowly , " with great care as is proper . " Over the next three years he deployed a series of papal theologians and envoys against Luther , which served only to harden the reformer 's anti-papal theology . First , the Dominican theologian Sylvester Mazzolini drafted a heresy case against Luther , whom Leo then summoned to Rome . The Elector Frederick persuaded the pope to have Luther examined at Augsburg , where the Imperial Diet was held . There , in October 1518 , under questioning by papal legate Cardinal Cajetan Luther stated that he did not consider the papacy part of the biblical Church because historistical interpretation of Bible prophecy concluded that the papacy was the Antichrist . The prophecies concerning the Antichrist soon became the center of controversy . The hearings degenerated into a shouting match . More than his writing the 95 Theses , Luther 's confrontation with the church cast him as an enemy of the pope . Cajetan 's original instructions had been to arrest Luther if he failed to recant , but the legate desisted from doing so . Luther slipped out of the city at night , unbeknownst to Cajetan .
By 750 , the feast of her conception was widely celebrated in the Byzantine East , under the name of the Conception ( active ) of Saint Anne . In the West it was known as the feast of the Conception ( passive ) of Mary , and was associated particularly with the Normans , whether these introduced it directly from the East or took it from English usage . The spread of the feast , by now with the adjective " Immaculate " attached to its title , met opposition on the part of some , on the grounds that sanctification was possible only after conception . Critics included Saints Bernard of Clairvaux , Albertus Magnus and Thomas Aquinas . Other theologians defended the expression " Immaculate Conception " , pointing out that sanctification could be conferred at the first moment of conception in view of the foreseen merits of Christ , a view held especially by Franciscans .
Instruments were marketed by teacher-dealers , much as the title character in the popular musical The Music Man . Often , these teacher-dealers conducted mandolin orchestras : groups of 4-50 musicians who played various mandolin family instruments . However , alongside the teacher-dealers were serious musicians , working to create a spot for the instrument in classical music , ragtime and jazz . Like the teacher-dealers , they traveled the U.S. , recording records , giving performances and teaching individuals and mandolin orchestras . Samuel Siegel played mandolin in Vaudeville and became one of America 's preeminent mandolinists . Seth Weeks was an African American who not only taught and performed in the United States , but also in Europe , where he recorded records . Another pioneering African American musician and director who made his start with a mandolin orchestra was composer James Reese Europe . W. Eugene Page toured the country with a group , and was well known for his mandolin and mandola performances . Other names include Valentine Abt , Samuel Adelstein , William Place , Jr. , and Aubrey Stauffer .

The next three drives of the game would end in punts .
In the new commercial climate glam metal bands like Europe , Ratt , White Lion and Cinderella broke up , Whitesnake went on hiatus in 1991 , and while many of these bands would re-unite again in the late 1990s or early 2000s , they never reached the commercial success they saw in the 1980s or early 1990s . Other bands such as Mötley Crüe and Poison saw personnel changes which impacted those bands ' commercial viability during the decade . In 1995 Van Halen released Balance , a multi-platinum seller that would be the band 's last with Sammy Hagar on vocals . In 1996 David Lee Roth returned briefly and his replacement , former Extreme singer Gary Cherone , was fired soon after the release of the commercially unsuccessful 1998 album Van Halen III and Van Halen would not tour or record again until 2004 . Guns N ' Roses ' original lineup was whittled away throughout the decade . Drummer Steven Adler was fired in 1990 , guitarist Izzy Stradlin left in late 1991 after recording Use Your Illusion I and II with the band . Tensions between the other band members and lead singer Axl Rose continued after the release of the 1993 covers album The Spaghetti Incident ? Guitarist Slash left in 1996 , followed by bassist Duff McKagan in 1997 . Axl Rose , the only original member , worked with a constantly changing lineup in recording an album that would take over fifteen years to complete .
A mandolin ( Italian : mandolino pronounced [ mandoˈliːno ] ; literally " small mandola " ) is a musical instrument in the lute family and is usually plucked with a plectrum or " pick " . It commonly has four courses of doubled metal strings tuned in unison ( 8 strings ) , although five ( 10 strings ) and six ( 12 strings ) course versions also exist . The courses are normally tuned in a succession of perfect fifths . It is the soprano member of a family that includes the mandola , octave mandolin , mandocello and mandobass .
In early modern times , cardinals often had important roles in secular affairs . In some cases , they took on powerful positions in government . In Henry VIII 's England , his chief minister was Cardinal Wolsey . Cardinal Richelieu 's power was so great that he was for many years effectively the ruler of France . Richelieu successor was also a cardinal , Jules Mazarin . Guillaume Dubois and André-Hercule de Fleury complete the list of the " four great " cardinals to have ruled France . [ citation needed ] In Portugal , due to a succession crisis , one cardinal , Henry , King of Portugal , was crowned king , the only example of a cardinal-king .
Despite some concerns , western vegetarians and vegans have not been found to suffer from overt zinc deficiencies any more than meat-eaters . Major plant sources of zinc include cooked dried beans , sea vegetables , fortified cereals , soyfoods , nuts , peas , and seeds . However , phytates in many whole-grains and fiber in many foods may interfere with zinc absorption and marginal zinc intake has poorly understood effects . The zinc chelator phytate , found in seeds and cereal bran , can contribute to zinc malabsorption . There is some evidence to suggest that more than the US RDA ( 15 mg ) of zinc daily may be needed in those whose diet is high in phytates , such as some vegetarians . These considerations must be balanced against the fact that there is a paucity of adequate zinc biomarkers , and the most widely used indicator , plasma zinc , has poor sensitivity and specificity . Diagnosing zinc deficiency is a persistent challenge .
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) has stated that zinc damages nerve receptors in the nose , which can cause anosmia . Reports of anosmia were also observed in the 1930s when zinc preparations were used in a failed attempt to prevent polio infections . On June 16 , 2009 , the FDA said that consumers should stop using zinc-based intranasal cold products and ordered their removal from store shelves . The FDA said the loss of smell can be life-threatening because people with impaired smell can not detect leaking gas or smoke and can not tell if food has spoiled before they eat it . Recent research suggests that the topical antimicrobial zinc pyrithione is a potent heat shock response inducer that may impair genomic integrity with induction of PARP-dependent energy crisis in cultured human keratinocytes and melanocytes .
Luther and his wife moved into a former monastery , " The Black Cloister , " a wedding present from the new elector John the Steadfast ( 1525–32 ) . They embarked on what appeared to have been a happy and successful marriage , though money was often short . Between bearing six children , Hans – June 1526 ; Elizabeth – 10 December 1527 , who died within a few months ; Magdalene – 1529 , who died in Luther 's arms in 1542 ; Martin – 1531 ; Paul – January 1533 ; and Margaret – 1534 ; Katharina helped the couple earn a living by farming the land and taking in boarders . Luther confided to Michael Stiefel on 11 August 1526 : " My Katie is in all things so obliging and pleasing to me that I would not exchange my poverty for the riches of Croesus . "
The New Kingdom c. 1550–1070 BC began with the Eighteenth Dynasty , marking the rise of Egypt as an international power that expanded during its greatest extension to an empire as far south as Tombos in Nubia , and included parts of the Levant in the east . This period is noted for some of the most well known Pharaohs , including Hatshepsut , Thutmose III , Akhenaten and his wife Nefertiti , Tutankhamun and Ramesses II . The first historically attested expression of monotheism came during this period as Atenism . Frequent contacts with other nations brought new ideas to the New Kingdom . The country was later invaded and conquered by Libyans , Nubians and Assyrians , but native Egyptians eventually drove them out and regained control of their country .
Manning finished the year with a career-low 67.9 passer rating , throwing for 2,249 yards and nine touchdowns , with 17 interceptions . In contrast , Osweiler threw for 1,967 yards , 10 touchdowns and six interceptions for a rating of 86.4 . Veteran receiver Demaryius Thomas led the team with 105 receptions for 1,304 yards and six touchdowns , while Emmanuel Sanders caught 76 passes for 1,135 yards and six scores , while adding another 106 yards returning punts . Tight end Owen Daniels was also a big element of the passing game with 46 receptions for 517 yards . Running back C. J. Anderson was the team 's leading rusher 863 yards and seven touchdowns , while also catching 25 passes for 183 yards . Running back Ronnie Hillman also made a big impact with 720 yards , five touchdowns , 24 receptions , and a 4.7 yards per carry average . Overall , the offense ranked 19th in scoring with 355 points and did not have any Pro Bowl selections .
Zinc chemistry is similar to the chemistry of the late first-row transition metals nickel and copper , though it has a filled d-shell , so its compounds are diamagnetic and mostly colorless . The ionic radii of zinc and magnesium happen to be nearly identical . Because of this some of their salts have the same crystal structure and in circumstances where ionic radius is a determining factor zinc and magnesium chemistries have much in common . Otherwise there is little similarity . Zinc tends to form bonds with a greater degree of covalency and it forms much more stable complexes with N- and S- donors . Complexes of zinc are mostly 4- or 6- coordinate although 5-coordinate complexes are known .
Since 1962 , the cardinal bishops have only a titular relationship with the suburbicarian sees , with no powers of governance over them . Each see has its own bishop , with the exception of Ostia , in which the Cardinal Vicar of the see of Rome is apostolic administrator .
From December 1539 , Luther became implicated in the bigamy of Philip I , Landgrave of Hesse , who wanted to marry one of his wife 's ladies-in-waiting . Philip solicited the approval of Luther , Melanchthon , and Bucer , citing as a precedent the polygamy of the patriarchs . The theologians were not prepared to make a general ruling , and they reluctantly advised the landgrave that if he was determined , he should marry secretly and keep quiet about the matter . As a result , on 4 March 1540 , Philip married a second wife , Margarethe von der Saale , with Melanchthon and Bucer among the witnesses . However , Philip was unable to keep the marriage secret , and he threatened to make Luther 's advice public . Luther told him to " tell a good , strong lie " and deny the marriage completely , which Philip did during the subsequent public controversy . In the view of Luther 's biographer Martin Brecht , " giving confessional advice for Philip of Hesse was one of the worst mistakes Luther made , and , next to the landgrave himself , who was directly responsible for it , history chiefly holds Luther accountable " . Brecht argues that Luther 's mistake was not that he gave private pastoral advice , but that he miscalculated the political implications . The affair caused lasting damage to Luther 's reputation .
Brass , which is an alloy of copper and zinc , has been used since at least the 10th century BC in Judea and by the 7th century BC in Ancient Greece . Zinc metal was not produced on a large scale until the 12th century in India and was unknown to Europe until the end of the 16th century . The mines of Rajasthan have given definite evidence of zinc production going back to the 6th century BC . To date , the oldest evidence of pure zinc comes from Zawar , in Rajasthan , as early as the 9th century AD when a distillation process was employed to make pure zinc . Alchemists burned zinc in air to form what they called " philosopher 's wool " or " white snow " .
Numerous modern mandolin makers build instruments that largely replicate the Gibson F-5 Artist models built in the early 1920s under the supervision of Gibson acoustician Lloyd Loar . Original Loar-signed instruments are sought after and extremely valuable . Other makers from the Loar period and earlier include Lyon and Healy , Vega and Larson Brothers . Some notable modern American carved mandolin manufacturers include , in addition to Kay , Gibson , Weber , Monteleone and Collings . Mandolins from other countries include The Loar ( China ) , Santa , Rosa ( China ) , Michael Kelly ( Korea ) , Eastman ( China ) , Kentucky ( China ) , Heiden ( Canada ) , Gilchrist ( Australia ) and Morgan Monroe ( China ) .
The instrument was primarily used in an ensemble setting well into the 1930s , and although the fad died out at the beginning of the 1930s , the instruments that were developed for the orchestra found a new home in bluegrass . The famous Lloyd Loar Master Model from Gibson ( 1923 ) was designed to boost the flagging interest in mandolin ensembles , with little success . However , The " Loar " became the defining instrument of bluegrass music when Bill Monroe purchased F-5 S/N 73987 in a Florida barbershop in 1943 and popularized it as his main instrument .
Luther next set about reversing or modifying the new church practices . By working alongside the authorities to restore public order , he signalled his reinvention as a conservative force within the Reformation . After banishing the Zwickau prophets , he now faced a battle against not only the established Church but also the radical reformers who threatened the new order by fomenting social unrest and violence .
Luther justified his opposition to the rebels on three grounds . First , in choosing violence over lawful submission to the secular government , they were ignoring Christ 's counsel to " Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar 's " ; St. Paul had written in his epistle to the Romans 13:1–7 that all authorities are appointed by God and therefore should not be resisted . This reference from the Bible forms the foundation for the doctrine known as the Divine Right of Kings , or , in the German case , the divine right of the princes . Second , the violent actions of rebelling , robbing , and plundering placed the peasants " outside the law of God and Empire " , so they deserved " death in body and soul , if only as highwaymen and murderers . " Lastly , Luther charged the rebels with blasphemy for calling themselves " Christian brethren " and committing their sinful acts under the banner of the Gospel .
By 1526 , Luther found himself increasingly occupied in organising a new church . His Biblical ideal of congregations ' choosing their own ministers had proved unworkable . According to Bainton : " Luther 's dilemma was that he wanted both a confessional church based on personal faith and experience and a territorial church including all in a given locality . If he were forced to choose , he would take his stand with the masses , and this was the direction in which he moved . " From 1525 to 1529 , he established a supervisory church body , laid down a new form of worship service , and wrote a clear summary of the new faith in the form of two catechisms . Luther 's thought is revolutionary to the extent that it is a theology of the cross , the negation of every affirmation : as long as the cross is at the center , the system building tendency of reason is held in check , and system building does not degenerate into System .
The agreements include fixed annual carriage fees of £30m for the channels with both channel suppliers able to secure additional capped payments if their channels meet certain performance-related targets . Currently there is no indication as to whether the new deal includes the additional Video On Demand and High Definition content which had previously been offered by BSkyB . As part of the agreements , both BSkyB and Virgin Media agreed to terminate all High Court proceedings against each other relating to the carriage of their respective basic channels .
Some scholars , such as Mark U. Edwards in his book Luther 's Last Battles : Politics and Polemics 1531–46 ( 1983 ) , suggest that since Luther 's increasingly antisemitic views developed during the years his health deteriorated , it is possible they were at least partly the product of a declining state of mind . Edwards also comments that Luther often deliberately used " vulgarity and violence " for effect , both in his writings condemning the Jews and in diatribes against " Turks " ( Muslims ) and Catholics .
There is confusion currently as to the name of the eldest Vinaccia luthier who first ran the shop . His name has been put forth as Gennaro Vinaccia ( active c. 1710 to c. 1788 ) and Nic . Vinaccia . His son Antonio Vinaccia was active c. 1734 to c. 1796 . An early extant example of a mandolin is one built by Antonio Vinaccia in 1759 , which resides at the University of Edinburgh . Another is by Giuseppe Vinaccia , built in 1893 , is also at the University of Edinburgh . The earliest extant mandolin was built in 1744 by Antonio 's son , Gaetano Vinaccia . It resides in the Conservatoire Royal de Musique in Brussels , Belgium .
On 8 February 2007 , BSkyB announced its intention to replace its three free-to-air digital terrestrial channels with four subscription channels . It was proposed that these channels would offer a range of content from the BSkyB portfolio including sport ( including English Premier League Football ) , films , entertainment and news . The announcement came a day after Setanta Sports confirmed that it would launch in March as a subscription service on the digital terrestrial platform , and on the same day that NTL 's services re-branded as Virgin Media . However , industry sources believe BSkyB will be forced to shelve plans to withdraw its channels from Freeview and replace them with subscription channels , due to possible lost advertising revenue .
Pope Leo X was used to reformers and heretics , and he responded slowly , " with great care as is proper . " Over the next three years he deployed a series of papal theologians and envoys against Luther , which served only to harden the reformer 's anti-papal theology . First , the Dominican theologian Sylvester Mazzolini drafted a heresy case against Luther , whom Leo then summoned to Rome . The Elector Frederick persuaded the pope to have Luther examined at Augsburg , where the Imperial Diet was held . There , in October 1518 , under questioning by papal legate Cardinal Cajetan Luther stated that he did not consider the papacy part of the biblical Church because historistical interpretation of Bible prophecy concluded that the papacy was the Antichrist . The prophecies concerning the Antichrist soon became the center of controversy . The hearings degenerated into a shouting match . More than his writing the 95 Theses , Luther 's confrontation with the church cast him as an enemy of the pope . Cajetan 's original instructions had been to arrest Luther if he failed to recant , but the legate desisted from doing so . Luther slipped out of the city at night , unbeknownst to Cajetan .
Another family of bowlback mandolins came from Milan and Lombardy . These mandolins are closer to the mandolino or mandore than other modern mandolins . They are shorter and wider than the standard Neapolitan mandolin , with a shallow back . The instruments have 6 strings , 3 wire treble-strings and 3 gut or wire-wrapped-silk bass-strings . The strings ran between the tuning pegs and a bridge that was glued to the soundboard , as a guitar 's . The Lombardic mandolins were tuned g b e ' a ' d " g " . A developer of the Milanese stye was Antonio Monzino ( Milan ) and his family who made them for 6 generations .
Martin Luther , who initiated the Protestant Reformation , said : " Mother Mary , like us , was born in sin of sinful parents , but the Holy Spirit covered her , sanctified and purified her so that this child was born of flesh and blood , but not with sinful flesh and blood . The Holy Spirit permitted the Virgin Mary to remain a true , natural human being of flesh and blood , just as we . However , he warded off sin from her flesh and blood so that she became the mother of a pure child , not poisoned by sin as we are . For in that moment when she conceived , she was a holy mother filled with the Holy Spirit and her fruit is a holy pure fruit , at once God and truly man , in one person . " Some Lutherans , such as the members of the Anglo-Lutheran Catholic Church , support the doctrine .
His last sermon was delivered at Eisleben , his place of birth , on 15 February 1546 , three days before his death . It was " entirely devoted to the obdurate Jews , whom it was a matter of great urgency to expel from all German territory , " according to Léon Poliakov . James Mackinnon writes that it concluded with a " fiery summons to drive the Jews bag and baggage from their midst , unless they desisted from their calumny and their usury and became Christians . " Luther said , " we want to practice Christian love toward them and pray that they convert , " but also that they are " our public enemies ... and if they could kill us all , they would gladly do so . And so often they do . "
The " Neo-Eriksonian " identity status paradigm emerged in later years [ when ? ] , driven largely by the work of James Marcia . This paradigm focuses upon the twin concepts of exploration and commitment . The central idea is that any individual 's sense of identity is determined in large part by the explorations and commitments that he or she makes regarding certain personal and social traits . It follows that the core of the research in this paradigm investigates the degrees to which a person has made certain explorations , and the degree to which he or she displays a commitment to those explorations .
Popular opinion remained firmly behind the celebration of Mary 's conception . In 1439 , the Council of Basel , which is not reckoned an ecumenical council , stated that belief in the immaculate conception of Mary is in accord with the Catholic faith . By the end of the 15th century the belief was widely professed and taught in many theological faculties , but such was the influence of the Dominicans , and the weight of the arguments of Thomas Aquinas ( who had been canonised in 1323 and declared " Doctor Angelicus " of the Church in 1567 ) that the Council of Trent ( 1545–63 ) —which might have been expected to affirm the doctrine—instead declined to take a position .
The merger made Columbia and Epic sister labels to RCA Records , which was once owned by RCA which also owned CBS rival NBC . It also started the process of bringing BMG 's Arista Records back under common ownership with its former parent Columbia Pictures , a Sony division since 1989 , and also brought Arista founder Clive Davis back into the fold . Davis is still with Sony Music as Chief Creative Officer .
Pope Sixtus V limited the number of cardinals to 70 , comprising six cardinal bishops , 50 cardinal priests , and 14 cardinal deacons . Starting in the pontificate of Pope John XXIII , that limit has been exceeded . At the start of 1971 , Pope Paul VI set the number of cardinal electors at a maximum of 120 , but set no limit on the number of cardinals generally . He also established a maximum age of eighty years for electors . His action deprived twenty-five living cardinals , including the three living cardinals elevated by Pope Pius XI , of the right to participate in a conclave . [ citation needed ] Popes can dispense from church laws and have sometimes brought the number of cardinals under the age of 80 to more than 120 . Pope Paul VI also increased the number of cardinal bishops by giving that rank to patriarchs of the Eastern Catholic Churches .
The celebrated John Duns Scotus ( d. 1308 ) , a Friar Minor like Saint Bonaventure , argued , on the contrary , that from a rational point of view it was certainly as little derogatory to the merits of Christ to assert that Mary was by him preserved from all taint of sin , as to say that she first contracted it and then was delivered . Proposing a solution to the theological problem of reconciling the doctrine with that of universal redemption in Christ , he argued that Mary 's immaculate conception did not remove her from redemption by Christ ; rather it was the result of a more perfect redemption granted her because of her special role in salvation history .
Other sources include fortified food and dietary supplements , which come in various forms . A 1998 review concluded that zinc oxide , one of the most common supplements in the United States , and zinc carbonate are nearly insoluble and poorly absorbed in the body . This review cited studies which found low plasma zinc concentrations after zinc oxide and zinc carbonate were consumed compared with those seen after consumption of zinc acetate and sulfate salts . However , harmful excessive supplementation is a problem among the relatively affluent , and should probably not exceed 20 mg/day in healthy people , although the U.S. National Research Council set a Tolerable Upper Intake of 40 mg/day .
On 13 June 1525 , the couple was engaged with Johannes Bugenhagen , Justus Jonas , Johannes Apel , Philipp Melanchthon and Lucas Cranach the Elder and his wife as witnesses . On the evening of the same day , the couple was married by Bugenhagen . The ceremonial walk to the church and the wedding banquet were left out , and were made up two weeks later on 27 June .
Most of the population ( as of 2000 [ update ] ) speaks German ( 104,465 or 81.2 % ) as their first language , Italian is the second most common ( 5,062 or 3.9 % ) and French is the third ( 4,671 or 3.6 % ) . There are 171 people who speak Romansh .
Pennies and other small coins are sometimes ingested by dogs , resulting in the need for medical treatment to remove the foreign body . The zinc content of some coins can cause zinc toxicity , which is commonly fatal in dogs , where it causes a severe hemolytic anemia , and also liver or kidney damage ; vomiting and diarrhea are possible symptoms . Zinc is highly toxic in parrots and poisoning can often be fatal . The consumption of fruit juices stored in galvanized cans has resulted in mass parrot poisonings with zinc .
Additionally , there are around 60,000 non-Jewish African immigrants in Israel , some of whom have sought asylum . Most of the migrants are from communities in Sudan and Eritrea , particularly the Niger-Congo-speaking Nuba groups of the southern Nuba Mountains ; some are illegal immigrants .
Although the doctrine of Mary 's Immaculate Conception appears only later among Latin ( and particularly Frankish ) theologians , it became ever more manifest among Byzantine theologians reliant on Gregory Nazianzen 's Mariology in the Medieval or Byzantine East . Although hymnographers and scholars , like the Emperor Justinian I , were accustomed to call Mary " prepurified " in their poetic and credal statements , the first point of departure for more fully commenting on Nazianzen 's meaning occurs in Sophronius of Jerusalem . In other places Sophronius explains that the Theotokos was already immaculate , when she was " purified " at the Annunciation and goes so far as to note that John the Baptist is literally " holier than all 'Men ' born of woman " since Mary 's surpassing holiness signifies that she was holier than even John after his sanctification in utero . Sophronius ' teaching is augmented and incorporated by St. John Damascene ( d. 749/750 ) . John , besides many passages wherein he extolls the Theotokos for her purification at the Annunciation , grants her the unique honor of " purifying the waters of baptism by touching them . " This honor was most famously and firstly attributed to Christ , especially in the legacy of Nazianzen . As such , Nazianzen 's assertion of parallel holiness between the prepurified Mary and purified Jesus of the New Testament is made even more explicit in Damascene in his discourse on Mary 's holiness to also imitate Christ 's baptism at the Jordan . The Damascene 's hymnongraphy and De fide Orthodoxa explicitly use Mary 's " pre purification " as a key to understanding her absolute holiness and unsullied human nature . In fact , Damascene ( along with Nazianzen ) serves as the source for nearly all subsequent promotion of Mary 's complete holiness from her Conception by the " all pure seed " of Joachim and the womb " wider than heaven " of St. Ann .
Luther 's 1541 hymn " Christ unser Herr zum Jordan kam " ( " To Jordan came the Christ our Lord " ) reflects the structure and substance of his questions and answers concerning baptism in the Small Catechism . Luther adopted a preexisting Johann Walter tune associated with a hymnic setting of Psalm 67 's prayer for grace ; Wolf Heintz 's four-part setting of the hymn was used to introduce the Lutheran Reformation in Halle in 1541 . Preachers and composers of the 18th century , including J. S. Bach , used this rich hymn as a subject for their own work , although its objective baptismal theology was displaced by more subjective hymns under the influence of late-19th-century Lutheran pietism .
The Panthers seemed primed to score on their opening drive of the second half when Newton completed a 45-yard pass to Ted Ginn Jr. on the Denver 35-yard line on their second offensive play . But the Broncos defense halted the drive on the 26-yard line , and it ended with no points when Graham Gano hit the uprights on a 44-yard field goal attempt . After the miss , Manning completed a pair of passes to Emmanuel Sanders for gains of 25 and 22 yards , setting up McManus ' 33-yard field goal that gave the Broncos a 16–7 lead . Carolina got off to another strong start after the kickoff , with Newton completing a 42-yard pass to Corey Brown . But once again they came up empty , this time as a result of a Newton pass that bounced off the hands of Ginn and was intercepted by safety T. J . Ward . Ward fumbled the ball during the return , but Trevathan recovered it to enable Denver to keep possession .
The Panthers beat the Seattle Seahawks in the divisional round , running up a 31–0 halftime lead and then holding off a furious second half comeback attempt to win 31–24 , avenging their elimination from a year earlier . The Panthers then blew out the Arizona Cardinals in the NFC Championship Game , 49–15 , racking up 487 yards and forcing seven turnovers .
To avoid confusing or upsetting the people , Luther avoided extreme change . He also did not wish to replace one controlling system with another . He concentrated on the church in the Electorate of Saxony , acting only as an adviser to churches in new territories , many of which followed his Saxon model . He worked closely with the new elector , John the Steadfast , to whom he turned for secular leadership and funds on behalf of a church largely shorn of its assets and income after the break with Rome . For Luther 's biographer Martin Brecht , this partnership " was the beginning of a questionable and originally unintended development towards a church government under the temporal sovereign " . The elector authorised a visitation of the church , a power formerly exercised by bishops . At times , Luther 's practical reforms fell short of his earlier radical pronouncements . For example , the Instructions for the Visitors of Parish Pastors in Electoral Saxony ( 1528 ) , drafted by Melanchthon with Luther 's approval , stressed the role of repentance in the forgiveness of sins , despite Luther 's position that faith alone ensures justification . The Eisleben reformer Johannes Agricola challenged this compromise , and Luther condemned him for teaching that faith is separate from works . The Instruction is a problematic document for those seeking a consistent evolution in Luther 's thought and practice .
The international repertoire of music for mandolin is almost unlimited , and musicians use it to play various types of music . This is especially true of violin music , since the mandolin has the same tuning of the violin . Following its invention and early development in Italy the mandolin spread throughout the European continent . The instrument was primarily used in a classical tradition with Mandolin orchestras , so called Estudiantinas or in Germany Zupforchestern appearing in many cities . Following this continental popularity of the mandolin family local traditions appeared outside of Europe in the Americas and in Japan . Travelling mandolin virtuosi like Giuseppe Pettine , Raffaele Calace and Silvio Ranieri contributed to the mandolin becoming a " fad " instrument in the early 20th century . This " mandolin craze " was fading by the 1930s , but just as this practice was falling into disuse , the mandolin found a new niche in American country , old-time music , bluegrass and folk music . More recently , the Baroque and Classical mandolin repertory and styles have benefited from the raised awareness of and interest in Early music , with media attention to classical players such as Israeli Avi Avital , Italian Carlo Aonzo and American Joseph Brent .
Luther objected to a saying attributed to Johann Tetzel that " As soon as the coin in the coffer rings , the soul from purgatory ( also attested as 'into heaven ' ) springs . "
In the autumn of 1991 , talks were held for the broadcast rights for Premier League for a five-year period , from the 1992 season . ITV were the current rights holders , and fought hard to retain the new rights . ITV had increased its offer from £18m to £34m per year to keep control of the rights . BSkyB joined forces with the BBC to make a counter bid . The BBC was given the highlights of most of the matches , while BSkyB paying £304m for the Premier League rights , would give them a monopoly of all live matches , up to 60 per year from the 1992 season . Murdoch described sport as a " battering ram " for pay-television , providing a strong customer base . A few weeks after the deal , ITV went to the High Court to get an injunction as it believed their bid details had been leaked before the decision was taken . ITV also asked the Office of Fair Trading to investigate since it believed Rupert Murdoch 's media empire via its newspapers had influenced the deal . A few days later neither action took effect , ITV believed BSkyB was telephoned and informed of its £262m bid , and Premier League advised BSkyB to increase its counter bid .
Monroe 's style involved playing lead melodies in the style of a fiddler , and also a percussive chording sound referred to as " the chop " for the sound made by the quickly struck and muted strings . He also perfected a sparse , percussive blues style , especially up the neck in keys that had not been used much in country music , notably B and E. He emphasized a powerful , syncopated right hand at the expense of left-hand virtuosity . Monroe 's most influential follower of the second generation is Frank Wakefield and nowadays Mike Compton of the Nashville Bluegrass Band and David Long , who often tour as a duet . Tiny Moore of the Texas Playboys developed an electric five-string mandolin and helped popularize the instrument in Western Swing music .
By that time , the majority of black people in the United States were native-born , so the use of the term " African " became problematic . Though initially a source of pride , many blacks feared that the use of African as an identity would be a hindrance to their fight for full citizenship in the US . They also felt that it would give ammunition to those who were advocating repatriating black people back to Africa . In 1835 , black leaders called upon Black Americans to remove the title of " African " from their institutions and replace it with " Negro " or " Colored American " . A few institutions chose to keep their historic names , such as the African Methodist Episcopal Church . African Americans popularly used the terms " Negro " or " colored " for themselves until the late 1960s .
Luther 's Commentary on Genesis contains a passage which concludes that " the soul does not sleep ( anima non sic dormit ) , but wakes ( sed vigilat ) and experiences visions " . Francis Blackburne in 1765 argued that John Jortin misread this and other passages from Luther , while Gottfried Fritschel pointed out in 1867 that it actually refers to the soul of a man " in this life " ( homo enim in hac vita ) tired from his daily labour ( defatigus diurno labore ) who at night enters his bedchamber ( sub noctem intrat in cubiculum suum ) and whose sleep is interrupted by dreams .
A funicular railway leads from the Marzili district to the Bundeshaus . The Marzilibahn funicular is , with a length of 106 m ( 348 ft ) , the second shortest public railway in Europe after the Zagreb funicular .
With Rivera having been a linebacker with the Chicago Bears in Super Bowl XX , and Kubiak replacing Elway at the end of the Broncos ' defeats in Super Bowls XXI and XXIV , this will be the first Super Bowl in which both head coaches played in the game themselves .
Luther wrote " Aus tiefer Not schrei ich zu dir " ( " From depths of woe I cry to you " ) in 1523 as a hymnic version of Psalm 130 and sent it as a sample to encourage evangelical colleagues to write psalm-hymns for use in German worship . In a collaboration with Paul Speratus , this and seven other hymns were published in the Achtliederbuch , the first Lutheran hymnal . In 1524 Luther developed his original four-stanza psalm paraphrase into a five-stanza Reformation hymn that developed the theme of " grace alone " more fully . Because it expressed essential Reformation doctrine , this expanded version of " Aus tiefer Not " was designated as a regular component of several regional Lutheran liturgies and was widely used at funerals , including Luther 's own . Along with Erhart Hegenwalt 's hymnic version of Psalm 51 , Luther 's expanded hymn was also adopted for use with the fifth part of Luther 's catechism , concerning confession .
The biographical tradition asserts that Virgil began the hexameter Eclogues ( or Bucolics ) in 42 BC and it is thought that the collection was published around 39–38 BC , although this is controversial . The Eclogues ( from the Greek for " selections " ) are a group of ten poems roughly modeled on the bucolic hexameter poetry ( " pastoral poetry " ) of the Hellenistic poet Theocritus . After his victory in the Battle of Philippi in 42 BC , fought against the army led by the assassins of Julius Caesar , Octavian tried to pay off his veterans with land expropriated from towns in northern Italy , supposedly including , according to the tradition , an estate near Mantua belonging to Virgil . The loss of his family farm and the attempt through poetic petitions to regain his property have traditionally been seen as Virgil 's motives in the composition of the Eclogues . This is now thought to be an unsupported inference from interpretations of the Eclogues . In Eclogues 1 and 9 , Virgil indeed dramatizes the contrasting feelings caused by the brutality of the land expropriations through pastoral idiom , but offers no indisputable evidence of the supposed biographic incident . While some readers have identified the poet himself with various characters and their vicissitudes , whether gratitude by an old rustic to a new god ( Ecl . 1 ) , frustrated love by a rustic singer for a distant boy ( his master 's pet , Ecl . 2 ) , or a master singer 's claim to have composed several eclogues ( Ecl . 5 ) , modern scholars largely reject such efforts to garner biographical details from works of fiction , preferring to interpret an author 's characters and themes as illustrations of contemporary life and thought . The ten Eclogues present traditional pastoral themes with a fresh perspective . Eclogues 1 and 9 address the land confiscations and their effects on the Italian countryside . 2 and 3 are pastoral and erotic , discussing both homosexual love ( Ecl . 2 ) and attraction toward people of any gender ( Ecl . 3 ) . Eclogue 4 , addressed to Asinius Pollio , the so-called " Messianic Eclogue " uses the imagery of the golden age in connection with the birth of a child ( who the child was meant to be has been subject to debate ) . 5 and 8 describe the myth of Daphnis in a song contest , 6 , the cosmic and mythological song of Silenus ; 7 , a heated poetic contest , and 10 the sufferings of the contemporary elegiac poet Cornelius Gallus . Virgil is credited [ by whom ? ] in the Eclogues with establishing Arcadia as a poetic ideal that still resonates in Western literature and visual arts and setting the stage for the development of Latin pastoral by Calpurnius Siculus , Nemesianus , and later writers .
On December 28 , 2015 , ESPN Deportes announced that they had reached an agreement with CBS and the NFL to be the exclusive Spanish-language broadcaster of the game , marking the third dedicated Spanish-language broadcast of the Super Bowl . Unlike NBC and Fox , CBS does not have a Spanish-language outlet of its own that could broadcast the game ( though per league policy , a separate Spanish play-by-play call was carried on CBS 's second audio program channel for over-the-air viewers ) . The game was called by ESPN Deportes ' Monday Night Football commentary crew of Alvaro Martin and Raul Allegre , and sideline reporter John Sutcliffe . ESPN Deportes broadcast pre-game and post-game coverage , while Martin , Allegre , and Sutcliffe contributed English-language reports for ESPN 's SportsCenter and Mike & Mike .
The Panthers offense , which led the NFL in scoring ( 500 points ) , was loaded with talent , boasting six Pro Bowl selections . Pro Bowl quarterback Cam Newton had one of his best seasons , throwing for 3,837 yards and rushing for 636 , while recording a career-high and league-leading 45 total touchdowns ( 35 passing , 10 rushing ) , a career-low 10 interceptions , and a career-best quarterback rating of 99.4 . Newton 's leading receivers were tight end Greg Olsen , who caught a career-high 77 passes for 1,104 yards and seven touchdowns , and wide receiver Ted Ginn , Jr. , who caught 44 passes for 739 yards and 10 touchdowns ; Ginn also rushed for 60 yards and returned 27 punts for 277 yards . Other key receivers included veteran Jerricho Cotchery ( 39 receptions for 485 yards ) , rookie Devin Funchess ( 31 receptions for 473 yards and five touchdowns ) , and second-year receiver Corey Brown ( 31 receptions for 447 yards ) . The Panthers backfield featured Pro Bowl running back Jonathan Stewart , who led the team with 989 rushing yards and six touchdowns in 13 games , along with Pro Bowl fullback Mike Tolbert , who rushed for 256 yards and caught 18 passes for another 154 yards . Carolina 's offensive line also featured two Pro Bowl selections : center Ryan Kalil and guard Trai Turner .
The city of Bern or Berne ( German : Bern , pronounced [ bɛrn ] ( listen ) ; French : Berne [ bɛʁn ] ; Italian : Berna [ ˈbɛrna ] ; Romansh : Berna [ ˈbɛrnɐ ] ( help·info ) ; Bernese German : Bärn [ b̥æːrn ] ) is the de facto capital of Switzerland , referred to by the Swiss as their ( e.g . in German ) Bundesstadt , or " federal city " . [ note 1 ] With a population of 140,634 ( November 2015 ) , Bern is the fifth most populous city in Switzerland . The Bern agglomeration , which includes 36 municipalities , had a population of 406,900 in 2014 . The metropolitan area had a population of 660,000 in 2000 . Bern is also the capital of the Canton of Bern , the second most populous of Switzerland 's cantons .
Dante made Virgil his guide in Hell and the greater part of Purgatory in The Divine Comedy . Dante also mentions Virgil in De vulgari eloquentia , along with Ovid , Lucan and Statius , as one of the four regulati poetae ( ii , vi , 7 ) .
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) has stated that zinc damages nerve receptors in the nose , which can cause anosmia . Reports of anosmia were also observed in the 1930s when zinc preparations were used in a failed attempt to prevent polio infections . On June 16 , 2009 , the FDA said that consumers should stop using zinc-based intranasal cold products and ordered their removal from store shelves . The FDA said the loss of smell can be life-threatening because people with impaired smell can not detect leaking gas or smoke and can not tell if food has spoiled before they eat it . Recent research suggests that the topical antimicrobial zinc pyrithione is a potent heat shock response inducer that may impair genomic integrity with induction of PARP-dependent energy crisis in cultured human keratinocytes and melanocytes .

After each team punted , Panthers quarterback Cam Newton appeared to complete a 24-yard pass Jerricho Cotchery , but the call was ruled an incompletion and upheld after a replay challenge . CBS analyst and retired referee Mike Carey stated he disagreed with the call and felt the review clearly showed the pass was complete . A few plays later , on 3rd-and-10 from the 15-yard line , linebacker Von Miller knocked the ball out of Newton 's hands while sacking him , and Malik Jackson recovered it in the end zone for a Broncos touchdown , giving the team a 10–0 lead . This was the first fumble return touchdown in a Super Bowl since Super Bowl XXVIII at the end of the 1993 season .
As the designated home team in the annual rotation between AFC and NFC teams , the Broncos elected to wear their road white jerseys with matching white pants . Elway stated , " We 've had Super Bowl success in our white uniforms . " The Broncos last wore matching white jerseys and pants in the Super Bowl in Super Bowl XXXIII , Elway 's last game as Denver QB , when they defeated the Atlanta Falcons 34–19 . In their only other Super Bowl win in Super Bowl XXXII , Denver wore blue jerseys , which was their primary color at the time . They also lost Super Bowl XXI when they wore white jerseys , but they are 0-4 in Super Bowls when wearing orange jerseys , losing in Super Bowl XII , XXII , XXIV , and XLVIII . The only other AFC champion team to have worn white as the designated home team in the Super Bowl was the Pittsburgh Steelers ; they defeated the Seattle Seahawks 21–10 in Super Bowl XL 10 seasons prior . The Broncos ' decision to wear white meant the Panthers would wear their standard home uniform : black jerseys with silver pants .
Concerns were raised over whether Levi 's Stadium 's field was of a high enough quality to host a Super Bowl ; during the inaugural season , the field had to be re-sodded multiple times due to various issues , and during a week 6 game earlier in the 2015 season , a portion of the turf collapsed under Baltimore Ravens kicker Justin Tucker , causing him to slip and miss a field goal , although the field has not had any major issues since . As is customary for Super Bowl games played at natural grass stadiums , the NFL re-sodded the field with a new playing surface ; a hybrid Bermuda 419 turf . NFL and Atlanta Braves field director Ed Mangan stated that the field was in " great shape " for gameday . However , the turf showed problem throughout the game , with a number of players needing to change their cleats during the game and player slipping during plays all throughout the game .
Other than by appearance , " Coloureds " can usually be distinguished from " Blacks " by language . Most speak Afrikaans or English as a first language , as opposed to Bantu languages such as Zulu or Xhosa . They also tend to have more European-sounding names than Bantu names .
In late November 2015 , reports surfaced stating that " multiple acts " would perform during the halftime show . On December 3 , the league confirmed that the show would be headlined by the British rock group Coldplay . On January 7 , 2016 , Pepsi confirmed to the Associated Press that Beyoncé , who headlined the Super Bowl XLVII halftime show and collaborated with Coldplay on the single " Hymn for the Weekend " , would be making an appearance . Bruno Mars , who headlined the Super Bowl XLVIII halftime show , and Mark Ronson also performed .
After a punt from both teams , Carolina got on track with a 9-play , 73-yard scoring drive . Newton completed 4 of 4 passes for 51 yards and rushed twice for 25 yards , while Jonathan Stewart finished the drive with a 1-yard touchdown run , cutting the score to 10–7 with 11:28 left in the second quarter . Later on , Broncos receiver Jordan Norwood received Brad Nortman 's short 28-yard punt surrounded by Panthers players , but none of them attempted to make a tackle , apparently thinking Norwood had called a fair catch . Norwood had not done so , and with no resistance around him , he took off for a Super Bowl record 61-yard return before Mario Addison dragged him down on the Panthers 14-yard line . Despite Denver 's excellent field position , they could not get the ball into the end zone , so McManus kicked a 33-yard field goal that increased their lead to 13–7 .
In March 2012 , Sony Music reportedly closed its Philippines office due to piracy , causing to move distribution of SME in the Philippines to Ivory Music .
Pope Sixtus V limited the number of cardinals to 70 , comprising six cardinal bishops , 50 cardinal priests , and 14 cardinal deacons . Starting in the pontificate of Pope John XXIII , that limit has been exceeded . At the start of 1971 , Pope Paul VI set the number of cardinal electors at a maximum of 120 , but set no limit on the number of cardinals generally . He also established a maximum age of eighty years for electors . His action deprived twenty-five living cardinals , including the three living cardinals elevated by Pope Pius XI , of the right to participate in a conclave . [ citation needed ] Popes can dispense from church laws and have sometimes brought the number of cardinals under the age of 80 to more than 120 . Pope Paul VI also increased the number of cardinal bishops by giving that rank to patriarchs of the Eastern Catholic Churches .
Phil Skinner played a key role in 20th century development of the mandolin movement in Australia , and was awarded an MBE in 1979 for services to music and the community . He was born Harry Skinner in Sydney in 1903 and started learning music at age 10 when his uncle tutored him on the banjo . Skinner began teaching part-time at age 18 , until the Great Depression forced him to begin teaching full-time and learn a broader range of instruments . Skinner founded the Sydney Mandolin Orchestra , the oldest surviving mandolin orchestra in Australia .
A few hard rock bands from the 1970s and 1980s managed to sustain highly successful recording careers . Bon Jovi were still able to achieve a commercial hit with " It 's My Life " from their double platinum-certified album Crush ( 2000 ) . and AC/DC released the platinum-certified Stiff Upper Lip ( 2000 ) Aerosmith released a number two platinum album , Just Push Play ( 2001 ) , which saw the band foray further into pop with the Top 10 hit " Jaded " , and a blues cover album , Honkin ' on Bobo , which reached number five in 2004 . Heart achieved their first Top 10 album since the early 90s with Red Velvet Car in 2010 , becoming the first female-led hard rock band to earn Top 10 albums spanning five decades . There were reunions and subsequent tours from Van Halen ( with Hagar in 2004 and then Roth in 2007 ) , The Who ( delayed in 2002 by the death of bassist John Entwistle until 2006 ) and Black Sabbath ( with Osbourne 1997–2006 and Dio 2006–2010 ) and even a one off performance by Led Zeppelin ( 2007 ) , renewing the interest in previous eras . Additionally , hard rock supergroups , such as Audioslave ( with former members of Rage Against the Machine and Soundgarden ) and Velvet Revolver ( with former members of Guns N ' Roses , punk band Wasted Youth and Stone Temple Pilots singer Scott Weiland ) , emerged and experienced some success . However , these bands were short-lived , ending in 2007 and 2008 , respectively . The long awaited Guns N ' Roses album Chinese Democracy was finally released in 2008 , but only went platinum and failed to come close to the success of the band 's late 1980s and early 1990s material . More successfully , AC/DC released the double platinum-certified Black Ice ( 2008 ) . Bon Jovi continued to enjoy success , branching into country music with " Who Says You Ca n't Go Home " , which reached number one on the Hot Country Singles chart in 2006 , and the rock/country album Lost Highway , which reached number one in 2007 . In 2009 , Bon Jovi released another number one album , The Circle , which marked a return to their hard rock sound .
In 1059 , the right of electing the pope was reserved to the principal clergy of Rome and the bishops of the seven suburbicarian sees . In the 12th century the practice of appointing ecclesiastics from outside Rome as cardinals began , with each of them assigned a church in Rome as his titular church or linked with one of the suburbicarian dioceses , while still being incardinated in a diocese other than that of Rome .

Other scholars argue that , even if his views were merely anti-Judaic—that is , opposed to Judaism and its adherence rather than the Jews as an ethnic group—their violence lent a new element to the standard Christian suspicion of Judaism . Ronald Berger writes that Luther is credited with " Germanizing the Christian critique of Judaism and establishing anti-Semitism as a key element of German culture and national identity . " Paul Rose argues that he caused a " hysterical and demonizing mentality " about Jews to enter German thought and discourse , a mentality that might otherwise have been absent . Christopher J. Probst in his book Demonizing the Jews : Luther and the Protestant Church in Nazi Germany ( 2012 ) , shows that a large number of German Lutheran clergy and theologians during the Nazi Third Reich used Luther 's hostile publications towards the Jews and their Jewish religion to justify at least in part the anti-Semitic policies of the National Socialists .
ARC was acquired in 1938 by the Columbia Broadcasting System ( CBS , which , in turn , had been formed by the Columbia Phonograph Company , but then sold off ) . ARC was renamed Columbia Recording Corporation . The Columbia Phonograph Company had international subsidiaries and affiliates such as the Columbia Graphophone Company in the United Kingdom , but they were sold off prior to CBS acquiring American Columbia . RCA Victor Records executive Ted Wallerstein convinced CBS head William S. Paley to buy ARC and Paley made Wallerstein head of the newly acquired record company . The renamed company made Columbia its flagship label with Okeh its subsidiary label while deemphasizing ARC 's other labels . This allowed ARC 's leased labels Brunswick Records and Vocalion Records to revert to former owner Warner Bros. which sold the labels to Decca Records . Columbia kept the Brunswick catalogue recorded from December 1931 onward which was reissued on the Columbia label as well as the Vocalion label material from the same time period which was reissued on the Okeh label . Wallerstein , who was promoted at the end of 1947 from president to chairman of the record company , restored Columbia 's status as a leading record company and spearheaded the successful introduction of the long playing ( LP ) record before he retired as Columbia 's chairman in 1951 . James Conkling then became head of Columbia Records . Also in 1951 , Columbia severed its ties with the EMI-owned record label of the same name and began a UK distribution deal with Philips Records , whereas Okeh Records continued to be distributed by EMI on the Columbia label .
Black people is a term used in certain countries , often in socially based systems of racial classification or of ethnicity , to describe persons who are perceived to be dark-skinned compared to other given populations . As such , the meaning of the expression varies widely both between and within societies , and depends significantly on context . For many other individuals , communities and countries , " black " is also perceived as a derogatory , outdated , reductive or otherwise unrepresentative label , and as a result is neither used nor defined .
He insisted that , since forgiveness was God 's alone to grant , those who claimed that indulgences absolved buyers from all punishments and granted them salvation were in error . Christians , he said , must not slacken in following Christ on account of such false assurances .
The City Council ( Gemeinderat ) constitutes the executive government of the City of Bern and operates as a collegiate authority . It is composed of five councilors ( German : Gemeinderat/-rätin ) , each presiding over a directorate ( Direktion ) comprising several departments and bureaus . The president of the executive department acts as mayor ( Stadtpräsident ) . In the mandate period 2013–2016 ( Legislatur ) the City Council is presided by Stadtpräsident Alexander Tschäppät . Departmental tasks , coordination measures and implementation of laws decreed by the City Parliament are carried by the City Council . The regular election of the City Council by any inhabitant valid to vote is held every four years . Any resident of Bern allowed to vote can be elected as a member of the City Council . The delegates are selected by means of a system of Majorz . The mayor is elected as such as well by public election while the heads of the other directorates are assigned by the collegiate . The executive body holds its meetings in the Erlacherhof , built by architect Albrecht Stürler after 1747 .
In the Colonial America of 1619 , John Rolfe used negars in describing the slaves who were captured from West Africa and then shipped to the Virginia colony . Later American English spellings , neger and neggar , prevailed in a northern colony , New York under the Dutch , and in metropolitan Philadelphia 's Moravian and Pennsylvania Dutch communities ; the African Burial Ground in New York City originally was known by the Dutch name " Begraafplaats van de Neger " ( Cemetery of the Negro ) ; an early US occurrence of neger in Rhode Island , dates from 1625 . Thomas Jefferson also used the term " black " in his Notes on the State of Virginia in allusion to the slave populations .
By the 1900s , nigger had become a pejorative word in the United States . In its stead , the term colored became the mainstream alternative to negro and its derived terms . After the African-American Civil rights movement , the terms colored and negro gave way to " black " . Negro had superseded colored as the most polite word for African Americans at a time when black was considered more offensive . This term was accepted as normal , including by people classified as Negroes , until the later Civil Rights movement in the late 1960s . One well-known example is the identification by Reverend Martin Luther King , Jr. of his own race as " Negro " in his famous speech of 1963 , I Have a Dream . During the American Civil Rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s , some African-American leaders in the United States , notably Malcolm X , objected to the word Negro because they associated it with the long history of slavery , segregation , and discrimination that treated African Americans as second-class citizens , or worse . Malcolm X preferred Black to Negro , but later gradually abandoned that as well for Afro-American after leaving the Nation of Islam .
SC Bern is the major ice hockey team of Bern who plays at the PostFinance Arena . The team has ranked highest in attendance for a European hockey team for more than a decade . The PostFinance Arena was the main host of the 2009 IIHF Ice Hockey World Championship , including the opening game and the final of the tournament .
Zinc is a chemical element with symbol Zn and atomic number 30 . It is the first element of group 12 of the periodic table . In some respects zinc is chemically similar to magnesium : its ion is of similar size and its only common oxidation state is +2 . Zinc is the 24th most abundant element in Earth 's crust and has five stable isotopes . The most common zinc ore is sphalerite ( zinc blende ) , a zinc sulfide mineral . The largest mineable amounts are found in Australia , Asia , and the United States . Zinc production includes froth flotation of the ore , roasting , and final extraction using electricity ( electrowinning ) .
From the end of World War II until 1971 , when John Rawls published A Theory of Justice , political philosophy declined in the Anglo-American academic world , as analytic philosophers expressed skepticism about the possibility that normative judgments had cognitive content , and political science turned toward statistical methods and behavioralism . In continental Europe , on the other hand , the postwar decades saw a huge blossoming of political philosophy , with Marxism dominating the field . This was the time of Jean-Paul Sartre and Louis Althusser , and the victories of Mao Zedong in China and Fidel Castro in Cuba , as well as the events of May 1968 led to increased interest in revolutionary ideology , especially by the New Left . A number of continental European émigrés to Britain and the United States—including Karl Popper , Friedrich Hayek , Leo Strauss , Isaiah Berlin , Eric Voegelin and Judith Shklar—encouraged continued study in political philosophy in the Anglo-American world , but in the 1950s and 1960s they and their students remained at odds with the analytic establishment .
Another misunderstanding is that , by her immaculate conception , Mary did not need a saviour . When defining the dogma in Ineffabilis Deus , Pope Pius IX explicitly affirmed that Mary was redeemed in a manner more sublime . He stated that Mary , rather than being cleansed after sin , was completely prevented from contracting Original Sin in view of the foreseen merits of Jesus Christ , the Savior of the human race . In Luke 1:47 , Mary proclaims : " My spirit has rejoiced in God my Saviour . " This is referred to as Mary 's pre-redemption by Christ . Since the Second Council of Orange against semi-pelagianism , the Catholic Church has taught that even had man never sinned in the Garden of Eden and was sinless , he would still require God 's grace to remain sinless .
On 15 June 1520 , the Pope warned Luther with the papal bull ( edict ) Exsurge Domine that he risked excommunication unless he recanted 41 sentences drawn from his writings , including the 95 Theses , within 60 days . That autumn , Johann Eck proclaimed the bull in Meissen and other towns . Karl von Miltitz , a papal nuncio , attempted to broker a solution , but Luther , who had sent the Pope a copy of On the Freedom of a Christian in October , publicly set fire to the bull and decretals at Wittenberg on 10 December 1520 , an act he defended in Why the Pope and his Recent Book are Burned and Assertions Concerning All Articles . As a consequence , Luther was excommunicated by Pope Leo X on 3 January 1521 , in the bull Decet Romanum Pontificem .
These different explorations of 'identity ' demonstrate how difficult a concept it is to pin down . Since identity is a virtual thing , it is impossible to define it empirically . Discussions of identity use the term with different meanings , from fundamental and abiding sameness , to fluidity , contingency , negotiated and so on . Brubaker and Cooper note a tendency in many scholars to confuse identity as a category of practice and as a category of analysis ( Brubaker & Cooper 2000 , p. 5 ) . Indeed , many scholars demonstrate a tendency to follow their own preconceptions of identity , following more or less the frameworks listed above , rather than taking into account the mechanisms by which the concept is crystallised as reality . In this environment , some analysts , such as Brubaker and Cooper , have suggested doing away with the concept completely ( Brubaker & Cooper 2000 , p. 1 ) . Others , by contrast , have sought to introduce alternative concepts in an attempt to capture the dynamic and fluid qualities of human social self-expression . Hall ( 1992 , 1996 ) , for example , suggests treating identity as a process , to take into account the reality of diverse and ever-changing social experience . Some scholars have introduced the idea of identification , whereby identity is perceived as made up of different components that are 'identified ' and interpreted by individuals . The construction of an individual sense of self is achieved by personal choices regarding who and what to associate with . Such approaches are liberating in their recognition of the role of the individual in social interaction and the construction of identity .

At the time of the fall of the Egyptian monarchy in the early 1950s , less than half a million Egyptians were considered upper class and rich , four million middle class and 17 million lower class and poor . Fewer than half of all primary-school-age children attended school , most of them being boys . Nasser 's policies changed this . Land reform and distribution , the dramatic growth in university education , and government support to national industries greatly improved social mobility and flattened the social curve . From academic year 1953-54 through 1965-66 , overall public school enrolments more than doubled . Millions of previously poor Egyptians , through education and jobs in the public sector , joined the middle class . Doctors , engineers , teachers , lawyers , journalists , constituted the bulk of the swelling middle class in Egypt under Nasser . During the 1960s , the Egyptian economy went from sluggish to the verge of collapse , the society became less free , and Nasser 's appeal waned considerably .

The United States provides Egypt with annual military assistance , which in 2015 amounted to US $ 1.3 billion . In 1989 , Egypt was designated as a major non-NATO ally of the United States . Nevertheless , ties between the two countries have partially soured since the July 2013 military coup that deposed Islamist president Mohamed Morsi , with the Obama administration condemning Egypt 's violent crackdown on the Muslim Brotherhood and its supporters , and cancelling future military exercises involving the two countries . There have been recent attempts , however , to normalise relations between the two , with both governments frequently calling for mutual support in the fight against regional and international terrorism .
In the 1960s , American and British blues and rock bands began to modify rock and roll by adding harder sounds , heavier guitar riffs , bombastic drumming , and louder vocals , from electric blues . Early forms of hard rock can be heard in the work of Chicago blues musicians Elmore James , Muddy Waters , and Howlin ' Wolf , The Kingsmen 's version of " Louie Louie " ( 1963 ) which made it a garage rock standard , and the songs of rhythm and blues influenced British Invasion acts , including " You Really Got Me " by The Kinks ( 1964 ) , " My Generation " by The Who ( 1965 ) , " Shapes of Things " ( 1966 ) by The Yardbirds and " ( I Ca n't Get No ) Satisfaction " ( 1965 ) by The Rolling Stones . From the late 1960s , it became common to divide mainstream rock music that emerged from psychedelia into soft and hard rock . Soft rock was often derived from folk rock , using acoustic instruments and putting more emphasis on melody and harmonies . In contrast , hard rock was most often derived from blues rock and was played louder and with more intensity .
Luther 's rediscovery of " Christ and His salvation " was the first of two points that became the foundation for the Reformation . His railing against the sale of indulgences was based on it .
The legend of Virgil in his Basket arose in the Middle Ages , and is often seen in art and mentioned in literature as part of the Power of Women literary topos , demonstrating the disruptive force of female attractiveness on men . In this story Virgil became enamoured of a beautiful woman , sometimes described as the emperor 's daughter or mistress and called Lucretia . She played him along and agreed to an assignation at her house , which he was to sneak into at night by climbing into a large basket let down from a window . When he did so he was only hoisted halfway up the wall and then left him trapped there into the next day , exposed to public ridicule . The story paralleled that of Phyllis riding Aristotle . Among other artists depicting the scene , Lucas van Leyden made a woodcut and later an engraving .
In 1839 Mariano Spada ( 1796 - 1872 ) , professor of theology at the Roman College of Saint Thomas , published Esame Critico sulla dottrina dell ’ Angelico Dottore S. Tommaso di Aquino circa il Peccato originale , relativamente alla Beatissima Vergine Maria [ A critical examination of the doctrine of St. Thomas Aquinas , the Angelic Doctor , regarding original sin with respect to the Most Blessed Virgin Mary ] , in which Aquinas is interpreted not as treating the question of the Immaculate Conception later formulated in the papal bull Ineffabilis Deus but rather the sanctification of the fetus within Mary 's womb . Spada furnished an interpretation whereby Pius IX was relieved of the problem of seeming to foster a doctrine not in agreement with the Aquinas ' teaching . Pope Pius IX would later appoint Spada Master of the Sacred Palace in 1867 .
Contemporary Eastern Orthodox Christians often object to the dogmatic declaration of her immaculate conception as an " over-elaboration " of the faith and because they see it as too closely connected with a particular interpretation of the doctrine of ancestral sin . All the same , the historical and authentic tradition of Mariology in Byzantium took its historical point of departure from Sophronios , Damascene , and their imitators . The most famous Eastern Orthodox theologian to imply Mary 's Immaculate Conception was St. Gregory Palamas . Though many passages from his works were long known to extol and attribute to Mary a Christlike holiness in her human nature , traditional objections to Palamas ' disposition toward the Immaculate Conception typically rely on a poor understanding of his doctrine of " the purification of Mary " at the Annunciation . Not only did he explicitly cite St. Gregory Nazianzen for his understanding of Jesus ' purification at His baptism and Mary 's at the Annunciation , but Theophanes of Nicaea , Joseph Bryennius , and Gennadios Scholarios all explicitly placed Mary 's Conception as the first moment of her all-immaculate participation in the divine energies to such a degree that she was always completely without spot and graced . In addition to Emperor Manuel II and Gennadius Scholarius , St. Mark of Ephesus also fervently defended Mary 's title as " prepurified " against the Dominican , Manuel Calecas , who was perhaps promoting thomistic Mariology that denied Mary 's all-holiness from the first moment of her existence .
Jethro Burns , best known as half of the comedy duo Homer and Jethro , was also the first important jazz mandolinist . Tiny Moore popularized the mandolin in Western swing music . He initially played an 8-string Gibson but switched after 1952 to a 5-string solidbody electric instrument built by Paul Bigsby . Modern players David Grisman , Sam Bush , and Mike Marshall , among others , have worked since the early 1970s to demonstrate the mandolin 's versatility for all styles of music . Chris Thile of California is a well-known player , and has accomplished many feats of traditional bluegrass , classical , contemporary pop and rock ; the band Nickel Creek featured his playing in its blend of traditional and pop styles , and he now plays in his band Punch Brothers . Most commonly associated with bluegrass , mandolin has been used a lot in country music over the years . Some well-known players include Marty Stuart , Vince Gill , and Ricky Skaggs .
A cardinal who is not a bishop is still entitled to wear and use the episcopal vestments and other pontificalia ( episcopal regalia : mitre , crozier , zucchetto , pectoral cross and ring ) . Even if not a bishop , any cardinal has both actual and honorary precedence over non-cardinal patriarchs , as well as the archbishops and bishops who are not cardinals , but he can not perform the functions reserved solely to bishops , such as ordination . The prominent priests who since 1962 were not ordained bishops on their elevation to the cardinalate were over the age of 80 or near to it , and so no cardinal who was not a bishop has participated in recent papal conclaves .
Erik Erikson ( 1902-1994 ) became one of the earliest psychologists to take an explicit interest in identity . The Eriksonian framework rests upon a distinction among the psychological sense of continuity , known as the ego identity ( sometimes identified simply as " the self " ) ; the personal idiosyncrasies that separate one person from the next , known as the personal identity ; and the collection of social roles that a person might play , known as either the social identity or the cultural identity . Erikson 's work , in the psychodynamic tradition , aimed to investigate the process of identity formation across a lifespan . Progressive strength in the ego identity , for example , can be charted in terms of a series of stages in which identity is formed in response to increasingly sophisticated challenges . The process of forming a viable sense of identity for the culture is conceptualized as an adolescent task , and those who do not manage a resynthesis of childhood identifications are seen as being in a state of 'identity diffusion ' whereas those who retain their initially given identities unquestioned have 'foreclosed ' identities ( Weinreich & Saunderson 2003 p7-8 ) . On some readings of Erikson , the development of a strong ego identity , along with the proper integration into a stable society and culture , lead to a stronger sense of identity in general . Accordingly , a deficiency in either of these factors may increase the chance of an identity crisis or confusion ( Cote & Levine 2002 , p. 22 ) .
The apartheid bureaucracy devised complex ( and often arbitrary ) criteria in the Population Registration Act of 1945 to determine who belonged in which group . Minor officials administered tests to enforce the classifications . When it was unclear from a person 's physical appearance whether the individual should be considered Coloured or Black , the " pencil test " was used . A pencil was inserted into a person 's hair to determine if the hair was kinky enough to hold the pencil , rather than having it pass through , as it would with smoother hair . If so , the person was classified as Black . Such classifications sometimes divided families .
Boundaries can be inclusive or exclusive depending on how they are perceived by other people . An exclusive boundary arises , for example , when a person adopts a marker that imposes restrictions on the behaviour of others . An inclusive boundary is created , by contrast , by the use of a marker with which other people are ready and able to associate . At the same time , however , an inclusive boundary will also impose restrictions on the people it has included by limiting their inclusion within other boundaries . An example of this is the use of a particular language by a newcomer in a room full of people speaking various languages . Some people may understand the language used by this person while others may not . Those who do not understand it might take the newcomer 's use of this particular language merely as a neutral sign of identity . But they might also perceive it as imposing an exclusive boundary that is meant to mark them off from her . On the other hand , those who do understand the newcomer 's language could take it as an inclusive boundary , through which the newcomer associates herself with them to the exclusion of the other people present . Equally , however , it is possible that people who do understand the newcomer but who also speak another language may not want to speak the newcomer 's language and so see her marker as an imposition and a negative boundary . It is possible that the newcomer is either aware or unaware of this , depending on whether she herself knows other languages or is conscious of the plurilingual quality of the people there and is respectful of it or not .
The Panthers beat the Seattle Seahawks in the divisional round , running up a 31–0 halftime lead and then holding off a furious second half comeback attempt to win 31–24 , avenging their elimination from a year earlier . The Panthers then blew out the Arizona Cardinals in the NFC Championship Game , 49–15 , racking up 487 yards and forcing seven turnovers .
Monroe 's style involved playing lead melodies in the style of a fiddler , and also a percussive chording sound referred to as " the chop " for the sound made by the quickly struck and muted strings . He also perfected a sparse , percussive blues style , especially up the neck in keys that had not been used much in country music , notably B and E. He emphasized a powerful , syncopated right hand at the expense of left-hand virtuosity . Monroe 's most influential follower of the second generation is Frank Wakefield and nowadays Mike Compton of the Nashville Bluegrass Band and David Long , who often tour as a duet . Tiny Moore of the Texas Playboys developed an electric five-string mandolin and helped popularize the instrument in Western Swing music .
The Sustainable Development Goals are ambitious , and they will require enormous efforts across countries , continents , industries and disciplines - but they are achievable . UNFPA is working with governments , partners and other UN agencies to directly tackle many of these goals - in particular Goal 3 on health , Goal 4 on education and Goal 5 on gender equality - and contributes in a variety of ways to achieving many of the rest .
In early 1991 , non-Arabs of the Zaghawa tribe of Sudan attested that they were victims of an intensifying Arab apartheid campaign , segregating Arabs and non-Arabs ( specifically people of sub-Saharan African descent ) . Sudanese Arabs , who controlled the government , were widely referred to as practicing apartheid against Sudan 's non-Arab citizens . The government was accused of " deftly manipulat ( ing ) Arab solidarity " to carry out policies of apartheid and ethnic cleansing .
Sometime after the publication of the Eclogues ( probably before 37 BC ) , Virgil became part of the circle of Maecenas , Octavian 's capable agent d'affaires who sought to counter sympathy for Antony among the leading families by rallying Roman literary figures to Octavian 's side . Virgil came to know many of the other leading literary figures of the time , including Horace , in whose poetry he is often mentioned , and Varius Rufus , who later helped finish the Aeneid .
Book 7 ( beginning the Iliadic half ) opens with an address to the muse and recounts Aeneas ' arrival in Italy and betrothal to Lavinia , daughter of King Latinus . Lavinia had already been promised to Turnus , the king of the Rutulians , who is roused to war by the Fury Allecto , and Amata Lavinia 's mother . In Book 8 , Aeneas allies with King Evander , who occupies the future site of Rome , and is given new armor and a shield depicting Roman history . Book 9 records an assault by Nisus and Euryalus on the Rutulians , Book 10 , the death of Evander 's young son Pallas , and 11 the death of the Volscian warrior princess Camilla and the decision to settle the war with a duel between Aeneas and Turnus . The Aeneid ends in Book 12 with the taking of Latinus ' city , the death of Amata , and Aeneas ' defeat and killing of Turnus , whose pleas for mercy are spurned . The final book ends with the image of Turnus ' soul lamenting as it flees to the underworld .
The concept of blackness in the United States has been described as the degree to which one associates themselves with mainstream African-American culture , politics , and values . To a certain extent , this concept is not so much about race but more about political orientation , culture and behavior . Blackness can be contrasted with " acting white " , where black Americans are said to behave with assumed characteristics of stereotypical white Americans with regard to fashion , dialect , taste in music , and possibly , from the perspective of a significant number of black youth , academic achievement .
Manning finished the year with a career-low 67.9 passer rating , throwing for 2,249 yards and nine touchdowns , with 17 interceptions . In contrast , Osweiler threw for 1,967 yards , 10 touchdowns and six interceptions for a rating of 86.4 . Veteran receiver Demaryius Thomas led the team with 105 receptions for 1,304 yards and six touchdowns , while Emmanuel Sanders caught 76 passes for 1,135 yards and six scores , while adding another 106 yards returning punts . Tight end Owen Daniels was also a big element of the passing game with 46 receptions for 517 yards . Running back C. J. Anderson was the team 's leading rusher 863 yards and seven touchdowns , while also catching 25 passes for 183 yards . Running back Ronnie Hillman also made a big impact with 720 yards , five touchdowns , 24 receptions , and a 4.7 yards per carry average . Overall , the offense ranked 19th in scoring with 355 points and did not have any Pro Bowl selections .
By 750 , the feast of her conception was widely celebrated in the Byzantine East , under the name of the Conception ( active ) of Saint Anne . In the West it was known as the feast of the Conception ( passive ) of Mary , and was associated particularly with the Normans , whether these introduced it directly from the East or took it from English usage . The spread of the feast , by now with the adjective " Immaculate " attached to its title , met opposition on the part of some , on the grounds that sanctification was possible only after conception . Critics included Saints Bernard of Clairvaux , Albertus Magnus and Thomas Aquinas . Other theologians defended the expression " Immaculate Conception " , pointing out that sanctification could be conferred at the first moment of conception in view of the foreseen merits of Christ , a view held especially by Franciscans .
In his 1805 mandolin method , Anweisung die Mandoline von selbst zu erlernen nebst einigen Uebungsstucken von Bortolazzi , Bartolomeo Bortolazzi popularised the Cremonese mandolin , which had four single-strings and a fixed bridge , to which the strings were attached . Bortolazzi said in this book that the new wire strung mandolins were uncomfortable to play , when compared with the gut-string instruments . Also , he felt they had a " less pleasing ... hard , zither-like tone " as compared to the gut string 's " softer , full-singing tone . " He favored the four single strings of the Cremonese instrument , which were tuned the same as the Neapolitan .

In this work , one of his most emphatic statements on faith , he argued that every good work designed to attract God 's favor is a sin . All humans are sinners by nature , he explained , and God 's grace ( which can not be earned ) alone can make them just . On 1 August 1521 , Luther wrote to Melanchthon on the same theme : " Be a sinner , and let your sins be strong , but let your trust in Christ be stronger , and rejoice in Christ who is the victor over sin , death , and the world . We will commit sins while we are here , for this life is not a place where justice resides . "
Some priests and former religious had already married , including Andreas Karlstadt and Justus Jonas , but Luther 's wedding set the seal of approval on clerical marriage . He had long condemned vows of celibacy on Biblical grounds , but his decision to marry surprised many , not least Melanchthon , who called it reckless . Luther had written to George Spalatin on 30 November 1524 , " I shall never take a wife , as I feel at present . Not that I am insensible to my flesh or sex ( for I am neither wood nor stone ) ; but my mind is averse to wedlock because I daily expect the death of a heretic . " Before marrying , Luther had been living on the plainest food , and , as he admitted himself , his mildewed bed was not properly made for months at a time .
Because of the acceptance of miscegenation , Brazil has avoided the binary polarization of society into black and white . In addition , it abolished slavery without a civil war . The bitter and sometimes violent racial tensions that have divided the US are notably absent in Brazil . According to the 2010 census , 6.7 % of Brazilians said they were black , compared with 6.2 % in 2000 , and 43.1 % said they were racially mixed , up from 38.5 % . In 2010 , Elio Ferreira de Araujo , Brazil 's minister for racial equality , attributed the increases to growing pride among his country 's black and indigenous communities .
Beside the introduction of the lute to Spain ( Andalusia ) by the Moors , another important point of transfer of the lute from Arabian to European culture was Sicily , where it was brought either by Byzantine or later by Muslim musicians . There were singer-lutenists at the court in Palermo following the Norman conquest of the island from the Muslims , and the lute is depicted extensively in the ceiling paintings in the Palermo ’ s royal Cappella Palatina , dedicated by the Norman King Roger II of Sicily in 1140 . His Hohenstaufen grandson Frederick II , Holy Roman Emperor ( 1194 - 1250 ) continued integrating Muslims into his court , including Moorish musicians . By the 14th century , lutes had disseminated throughout Italy and , probably because of the cultural influence of the Hohenstaufen kings and emperor , based in Palermo , the lute had also made significant inroads into the German-speaking lands .
Carolina suffered a major setback when Thomas Davis , an 11-year veteran who had already overcome three ACL tears in his career , went down with a broken arm in the NFC Championship Game . Despite this , he insisted he would still find a way to play in the Super Bowl . His prediction turned out to be accurate .
In his theses and disputations against the antinomians , Luther reviews and reaffirms , on the one hand , what has been called the " second use of the law , " that is , the law as the Holy Spirit 's tool to work sorrow over sin in man 's heart , thus preparing him for Christ 's fulfillment of the law offered in the gospel . Luther states that everything that is used to work sorrow over sin is called the law , even if it is Christ 's life , Christ 's death for sin , or God 's goodness experienced in creation . Simply refusing to preach the Ten Commandments among Christians – thereby , as it were , removing the three letters l-a-w from the church – does not eliminate the accusing law . Claiming that the law – in any form – should not be preached to Christians anymore would be tantamount to asserting that Christians are no longer sinners in themselves and that the church consists only of essentially holy people .
Bern was occupied by French troops in 1798 during the French Revolutionary Wars , when it was stripped of parts of its territories . It regained control of the Bernese Oberland in 1802 , and following the Congress of Vienna of 1814 , it newly acquired the Bernese Jura . At this time , it once again became the largest canton of the confederacy as it stood during the Restoration and until the secession of the canton of Jura in 1979 . Bern was made the Federal City ( seat of the Federal Assembly ) within the new Swiss federal state in 1848 .
On Carolina 's next possession fullback Mike Tolbert lost a fumble while being tackled by safety Darian Stewart , which linebacker Danny Trevathan recovered on the Broncos 40-yard line . However , the Panthers soon took the ball back when defensive end Kony Ealy tipped a Manning pass to himself and then intercepted it , returning the ball 19 yards to the Panthers 39-yard line with 1:55 left on the clock . The Panthers could not gain any yards with their possession and had to punt . After a Denver punt , Carolina drove to the Broncos 45-yard line . But with 11 seconds left , Newton was sacked by DeMarcus Ware as time expired in the half .
In the early 1970s the Rolling Stones developed their hard rock sound with Exile on Main St. ( 1972 ) . Initially receiving mixed reviews , according to critic Steve Erlewine it is now " generally regarded as the Rolling Stones ' finest album " . They continued to pursue the riff-heavy sound on albums including It 's Only Rock 'n ' Roll ( 1974 ) and Black and Blue ( 1976 ) . Led Zeppelin began to mix elements of world and folk music into their hard rock from Led Zeppelin III ( 1970 ) and Led Zeppelin IV ( 1971 ) . The latter included the track " Stairway to Heaven " , which would become the most played song in the history of album-oriented radio . Deep Purple continued to define hard rock , particularly with their album Machine Head ( 1972 ) , which included the tracks " Highway Star " and " Smoke on the Water " . In 1975 guitarist Ritchie Blackmore left , going on to form Rainbow and after the break-up of the band the next year , vocalist David Coverdale formed Whitesnake . 1970 saw The Who release Live at Leeds , often seen as the archetypal hard rock live album , and the following year they released their highly acclaimed album Who 's Next , which mixed heavy rock with extensive use of synthesizers . Subsequent albums , including Quadrophenia ( 1973 ) , built on this sound before Who Are You ( 1978 ) , their last album before the death of pioneering rock drummer Keith Moon later that year .
As of 2015 , Bern 's City Council is made up of two representatives of the SP ( Social Democratic Party , of whom one is also the mayor ) , and one each of CVP ( Christian Democratic Party ) , GB ( Green Alliance of Berne ) , and FDP ( FDP.The Liberals ) , giving the left parties a majority of three out of five seats . The last election was held on 25 November 2012 .
At various times , there have been cardinals who had only received first tonsure and minor orders but not yet been ordained as deacons or priests . Though clerics , they were inaccurately called " lay cardinals " and were permitted to marry . Teodolfo Mertel was among the last of the lay cardinals . When he died in 1899 he was the last surviving cardinal who was not at least ordained a priest . With the revision of the Code of Canon Law promulgated in 1917 by Pope Benedict XV , only those who are already priests or bishops may be appointed cardinals . Since the time of Pope John XXIII a priest who is appointed a cardinal must be consecrated a bishop , unless he obtains a dispensation .
The mandolin orchestras never completely went away , however . In fact , along with all the other musical forms the mandolin is involved with , the mandolin ensemble ( groups usually arranged like the string section of a modern symphony orchestra , with first mandolins , second mandolins , mandolas , mandocellos , mando-basses , and guitars , and sometimes supplemented by other instruments ) continues to grow in popularity . Since the mid-nineties , several public-school mandolin-based guitar programs have blossomed around the country , including Fretworks Mandolin and Guitar Orchestra , the first of its kind . The national organization , Classical Mandolin Society of America , founded by Norman Levine , represents these groups . Prominent modern mandolinists and composers for mandolin in the classical music tradition include Samuel Firstman , Howard Fry , Rudy Cipolla , Dave Apollon , Neil Gladd , Evan Marshall , Marilynn Mair and Mark Davis ( the Mair-Davis Duo ) , Brian Israel , David Evans , Emanuil Shynkman , Radim Zenkl , David Del Tredici and Ernst Krenek .
Brass , which is an alloy of copper and zinc , has been used since at least the 10th century BC in Judea and by the 7th century BC in Ancient Greece . Zinc metal was not produced on a large scale until the 12th century in India and was unknown to Europe until the end of the 16th century . The mines of Rajasthan have given definite evidence of zinc production going back to the 6th century BC . To date , the oldest evidence of pure zinc comes from Zawar , in Rajasthan , as early as the 9th century AD when a distillation process was employed to make pure zinc . Alchemists burned zinc in air to form what they called " philosopher 's wool " or " white snow " .
According to the commentators , Virgil received his first education when he was five years old and he later went to Cremona , Milan , and finally Rome to study rhetoric , medicine , and astronomy , which he soon abandoned for philosophy . From Virgil 's admiring references to the neoteric writers Pollio and Cinna , it has been inferred that he was , for a time , associated with Catullus ' neoteric circle . However schoolmates considered Virgil extremely shy and reserved , according to Servius , and he was nicknamed " Parthenias " or " maiden " because of his social aloofness . Virgil seems to have suffered bad health throughout his life and in some ways lived the life of an invalid . According to the Catalepton , while in the Epicurean school of Siro the Epicurean at Naples , he began to write poetry . A group of small works attributed to the youthful Virgil by the commentators survive collected under the title Appendix Vergiliana , but are largely considered spurious by scholars . One , the Catalepton , consists of fourteen short poems , some of which may be Virgil 's , and another , a short narrative poem titled the Culex ( " The Gnat " ) , was attributed to Virgil as early as the 1st century AD .
The Panthers defense gave up just 308 points , ranking sixth in the league , while also leading the NFL in interceptions with 24 and boasting four Pro Bowl selections . Pro Bowl defensive tackle Kawann Short led the team in sacks with 11 , while also forcing three fumbles and recovering two . Fellow lineman Mario Addison added 6½ sacks . The Panthers line also featured veteran defensive end Jared Allen , a 5-time pro bowler who was the NFL 's active career sack leader with 136 , along with defensive end Kony Ealy , who had 5 sacks in just 9 starts . Behind them , two of the Panthers three starting linebackers were also selected to play in the Pro Bowl : Thomas Davis and Luke Kuechly . Davis compiled 5½ sacks , four forced fumbles , and four interceptions , while Kuechly led the team in tackles ( 118 ) forced two fumbles , and intercepted four passes of his own . Carolina 's secondary featured Pro Bowl safety Kurt Coleman , who led the team with a career high seven interceptions , while also racking up 88 tackles and Pro Bowl cornerback Josh Norman , who developed into a shutdown corner during the season and had four interceptions , two of which were returned for touchdowns .
As of 2003 [ update ] the average price to rent an average apartment in Bern was 1108.92 Swiss francs ( CHF ) per month ( US $ 890 , £500 , €710 approx . exchange rate from 2003 ) . The average rate for a one-room apartment was 619.82 CHF ( US $ 500 , £280 , €400 ) , a two-room apartment was about 879.36 CHF ( US $ 700 , £400 , €560 ) , a three-room apartment was about 1040.54 CHF ( US $ 830 , £470 , €670 ) and a six or more room apartment cost an average of 2094.80 CHF ( US $ 1680 , £940 , €1340 ) . The average apartment price in Bern was 99.4 % of the national average of 1116 CHF . The vacancy rate for the municipality , in 2010 [ update ] , was 0.45 % .
The Romans interacted with and later conquered parts of Mauretania , an early state that covered modern Morocco , western Algeria , and the Spanish cities Ceuta and Melilla during the classical period . The people of the region were noted in Classical literature as Mauri , which was subsequently rendered as Moors in English .
He later attributed his decision to an event : on 2 July 1505 , he was returning to university on horseback after a trip home . During a thunderstorm , a lightning bolt struck near him . Later telling his father he was terrified of death and divine judgment , he cried out , " Help ! Saint Anna , I will become a monk ! " He came to view his cry for help as a vow he could never break . He left law school , sold his books , and entered a closed Augustinian cloister in Erfurt on 17 July 1505 . One friend blamed the decision on Luther 's sadness over the deaths of two friends . Luther himself seemed saddened by the move . Those who attended a farewell supper walked him to the door of the Black Cloister . " This day you see me , and then , not ever again , " he said . His father was furious over what he saw as a waste of Luther 's education .
The Super Bowl 50 Host Committee has vowed to be " the most giving Super Bowl ever " , and will dedicate 25 percent of all money it raises for philanthropic causes in the Bay Area . The committee created the 50 fund as its philanthropic initiative and focuses on providing grants to aid with youth development , community investment and sustainable environments .
A piece of paper was later found on which Luther had written his last statement . The statement was in Latin , apart from " We are beggars , " which was in German .
In honor of the 50th Super Bowl , the pregame ceremony featured the on-field introduction of 39 of the 43 previous Super Bowl Most Valuable Players . Bart Starr ( MVP of Super Bowls I and II ) and Chuck Howley ( MVP of Super Bowl V ) appeared via video , while Peyton Manning ( MVP of Super Bowl XLI and current Broncos quarterback ) was shown in the locker room preparing for the game . No plans were announced regarding the recognition of Harvey Martin , co-MVP of Super Bowl XII , who died in 2001 .
Prior to the Golden Age of Mandolins , France had a history with the mandolin , with mandolinists playing in Paris until the Napoleonic Wars . The players , teachers and composers included Giovanni Fouchetti , Eduardo Mezzacapo , Gabriele Leon , and Gervasio . During the Golden age itself ( 1880s-1920s ) , the mandolin had a strong presence in France . Prominent mandolin players or composers included Jules Cottin and his sister Madeleine Cottin , Jean Pietrapertosa , and Edgar Bara . Paris had dozens of " estudiantina " mandolin orchestras in the early 1900s . Mandolin magazines included L'Estudiantina , Le Plectre , École de la mandolie .
Egyptian music is a rich mixture of indigenous , Mediterranean , African and Western elements . It has been an integral part of Egyptian culture since antiquity . The ancient Egyptians credited one of their gods Hathor with the invention of music , which Osiris in turn used as part of his effort to civilise the world . Egyptians used music instruments since then . Contemporary Egyptian music traces its beginnings to the creative work of people such as Abdu El Hamouli , Almaz and Mahmoud Osman , who influenced the later work of Sayed Darwish , Umm Kulthum , Mohammed Abdel Wahab and Abdel Halim Hafez whose age is considered the golden age of music in Egypt and the whole Middle East and North-Africa . Prominent contemporary Egyptian pop singers include Amr Diab and Mohamed Mounir .
Other widely used alloys that contain zinc include nickel silver , typewriter metal , soft and aluminium solder , and commercial bronze . Zinc is also used in contemporary pipe organs as a substitute for the traditional lead/tin alloy in pipes . Alloys of 85–88 % zinc , 4–10 % copper , and 2–8 % aluminium find limited use in certain types of machine bearings . Zinc is the primary metal used in making American one cent coins since 1982 . The zinc core is coated with a thin layer of copper to give the impression of a copper coin . In 1994 , 33,200 tonnes ( 36,600 short tons ) of zinc were used to produce 13.6 billion pennies in the United States .
Following their loss in the divisional round of the previous season 's playoffs , the Denver Broncos underwent numerous coaching changes , including a mutual parting with head coach John Fox ( who had won four divisional championships in his four years as Broncos head coach ) , and the hiring of Gary Kubiak as the new head coach . Under Kubiak , the Broncos planned to install a run-oriented offense with zone blocking to blend in with quarterback Peyton Manning 's shotgun passing skills , but struggled with numerous changes and injuries to the offensive line , as well as Manning having his worst statistical season since his rookie year with the Indianapolis Colts in 1998 , due to a plantar fasciitis injury in his heel that he had suffered since the summer , and the simple fact that Manning was getting old , as he turned 39 in the 2015 off-season . Although the team had a 7–0 start , Manning led the NFL in interceptions . In week 10 , Manning suffered a partial tear of the plantar fasciitis in his left foot . He set the NFL 's all-time record for career passing yards in this game , but was benched after throwing four interceptions in favor of backup quarterback Brock Osweiler , who took over as the starter for most of the remainder of the regular season . Osweiler was injured , however , leading to Manning 's return during the Week 17 regular season finale , where the Broncos were losing 13–7 against the 4–11 San Diego Chargers , resulting in Manning re-claiming the starting quarterback position for the playoffs by leading the team to a key 27–20 win that enabled the team to clinch the number one overall AFC seed . Under defensive coordinator Wade Phillips , the Broncos ' defense ranked number one in total yards allowed , passing yards allowed and sacks , and like the previous three seasons , the team has continued to set numerous individual , league and franchise records . With the defense carrying the team despite the issues with the offense , the Broncos finished the regular season with a 12–4 record and earned home-field advantage throughout the AFC playoffs .
Though almost any variety of acoustic mandolin might be adequate for Irish traditional music , virtually all Irish players prefer flat-backed instruments with oval sound holes to the Italian-style bowl-back mandolins or the carved-top mandolins with f-holes favoured by bluegrass mandolinists . The former are often too soft-toned to hold their own in a session ( as well as having a tendency to not stay in place on the player 's lap ) , whilst the latter tend to sound harsh and overbearing to the traditional ear . The f-hole mandolin , however , does come into its own in a traditional session , where its brighter tone cuts through the sonic clutter of a pub . Greatly preferred for formal performance and recording are flat-topped " Irish-style " mandolins ( reminiscent of the WWI-era Martin Army-Navy mandolin ) and carved ( arch ) top mandolins with oval soundholes , such as the Gibson A-style of the 1920s .
Nearly two billion people in the developing world are deficient in zinc . In children it causes an increase in infection and diarrhea , contributing to the death of about 800,000 children worldwide per year . The World Health Organization advocates zinc supplementation for severe malnutrition and diarrhea . Zinc supplements help prevent disease and reduce mortality , especially among children with low birth weight or stunted growth . However , zinc supplements should not be administered alone , because many in the developing world have several deficiencies , and zinc interacts with other micronutrients .
The city of Bern or Berne ( German : Bern , pronounced [ bɛrn ] ( listen ) ; French : Berne [ bɛʁn ] ; Italian : Berna [ ˈbɛrna ] ; Romansh : Berna [ ˈbɛrnɐ ] ( help·info ) ; Bernese German : Bärn [ b̥æːrn ] ) is the de facto capital of Switzerland , referred to by the Swiss as their ( e.g . in German ) Bundesstadt , or " federal city " . [ note 1 ] With a population of 140,634 ( November 2015 ) , Bern is the fifth most populous city in Switzerland . The Bern agglomeration , which includes 36 municipalities , had a population of 406,900 in 2014 . The metropolitan area had a population of 660,000 in 2000 . Bern is also the capital of the Canton of Bern , the second most populous of Switzerland 's cantons .
Partly because of low sanitation coverage about 17,000 children die each year because of diarrhoea . Another challenge is low cost recovery due to water tariffs that are among the lowest in the world . This in turn requires government subsidies even for operating costs , a situation that has been aggravated by salary increases without tariff increases after the Arab Spring . Poor operation of facilities , such as water and wastewater treatment plants , as well as limited government accountability and transparency , are also issues .
However , the formation of one 's identity occurs through one 's identifications with significant others ( primarily with parents and other individuals during one 's biographical experiences , and also with " groups " as they are perceived ) . These others may be benign - such that one aspires to their characteristics , values and beliefs ( a process of idealistic-identification ) , or malign - when one wishes to dissociate from their characteristics ( a process of defensive contra-identification ) ( Weinreich & Saunderson 2003 , Chapter 1 , pp 54–61 ) .
On June 4 , 2014 , the NFL announced that the practice of branding Super Bowl games with Roman numerals , a practice established at Super Bowl V , would be temporarily suspended , and that the game would be named using Arabic numerals as Super Bowl 50 as opposed to Super Bowl L. The use of Roman numerals will be reinstated for Super Bowl LI . Jaime Weston , the league 's vice president of brand and creative , explained that a primary reason for the change was the difficulty of designing an aesthetically pleasing logo with the letter " L " using the standardized logo template introduced at Super Bowl XLV . The logo also deviates from the template by featuring large numerals , colored in gold , behind the Vince Lombardi Trophy , instead of underneath and in silver as in the standard logo .
Bern was occupied by French troops in 1798 during the French Revolutionary Wars , when it was stripped of parts of its territories . It regained control of the Bernese Oberland in 1802 , and following the Congress of Vienna of 1814 , it newly acquired the Bernese Jura . At this time , it once again became the largest canton of the confederacy as it stood during the Restoration and until the secession of the canton of Jura in 1979 . Bern was made the Federal City ( seat of the Federal Assembly ) within the new Swiss federal state in 1848 .
In Latin , on the other hand , the [ First name ] Cardinal [ Surname ] order is used in the proclamation of the election of a new pope by the cardinal protodeacon : " Annuntio vobis gaudium magnum ; habemus Papam : Eminentissimum ac Reverendissimum Dominum , Dominum ( first name ) Sanctae Romanae Ecclesiae Cardinalem ( last name ) , ... " ( Meaning : " I announce to you a great joy ; we have a Pope : The Most Eminent and Most Reverend Lord , Lord ( first name ) Cardinal of the Holy Roman Church ( last name ) , ... " ) This assumes that the new pope had been a cardinal just before becoming pope ; the most recent election of a non-cardinal as pope was in 1378 .
At the time of the Marburg Colloquy , Suleiman the Magnificent was besieging Vienna with a vast Ottoman army . Luther had argued against resisting the Turks in his 1518 Explanation of the Ninety-five Theses , provoking accusations of defeatism . He saw the Turks as a scourge sent to punish Christians by God , as agents of the Biblical apocalypse that would destroy the antichrist , whom Luther believed to be the papacy , and the Roman Church . He consistently rejected the idea of a Holy War , " as though our people were an army of Christians against the Turks , who were enemies of Christ . This is absolutely contrary to Christ 's doctrine and name " . On the other hand , in keeping with his doctrine of the two kingdoms , Luther did support non-religious war against the Turks . In 1526 , he argued in Whether Soldiers can be in a State of Grace that national defence is reason for a just war . By 1529 , in On War against the Turk , he was actively urging Emperor Charles V and the German people to fight a secular war against the Turks . He made clear , however , that the spiritual war against an alien faith was separate , to be waged through prayer and repentance . Around the time of the Siege of Vienna , Luther wrote a prayer for national deliverance from the Turks , asking God to " give to our emperor perpetual victory over our enemies " .
Doug Morris , who was head of Warner Music Group , then Universal Music , became chairman and CEO of the company on July 1 , 2011 . Sony Music underwent a restructuring after Morris ' arrival . He was joined by L.A. Reid , who became the chairman and CEO of Epic Records . Under Reid , multiple artists from the Jive half of the former RCA/Jive Label Group moved to Epic . Peter Edge became the new CEO of the RCA Records unit . The RCA Music Group closed down Arista , J Records and Jive Records in October 2011 , with the artists from those labels being moved to RCA Records .
On December 28 , 2015 , ESPN Deportes announced that they had reached an agreement with CBS and the NFL to be the exclusive Spanish-language broadcaster of the game , marking the third dedicated Spanish-language broadcast of the Super Bowl . Unlike NBC and Fox , CBS does not have a Spanish-language outlet of its own that could broadcast the game ( though per league policy , a separate Spanish play-by-play call was carried on CBS 's second audio program channel for over-the-air viewers ) . The game was called by ESPN Deportes ' Monday Night Football commentary crew of Alvaro Martin and Raul Allegre , and sideline reporter John Sutcliffe . ESPN Deportes broadcast pre-game and post-game coverage , while Martin , Allegre , and Sutcliffe contributed English-language reports for ESPN 's SportsCenter and Mike & Mike .
Super Bowl 50 featured numerous records from individuals and teams . Denver won despite being massively outgained in total yards ( 315 to 194 ) and first downs ( 21 to 11 ) . Their 194 yards and 11 first downs were both the lowest totals ever by a Super Bowl winning team . The previous record was 244 yards by the Baltimore Ravens in Super Bowl XXXV . Only seven other teams had ever gained less than 200 yards in a Super Bowl , and all of them had lost . The Broncos ' seven sacks tied a Super Bowl record set by the Chicago Bears in Super Bowl XX . Kony Ealy tied a Super Bowl record with three sacks . Jordan Norwood 's 61-yard punt return set a new record , surpassing the old record of 45 yards set by John Taylor in Super Bowl XXIII . Denver was just 1-of-14 on third down , while Carolina was barely better at 3-of-15 . The two teams ' combined third down conversion percentage of 13.8 was a Super Bowl low . Manning and Newton had quarterback passer ratings of 56.6 and 55.4 , respectively , and their added total of 112 is a record lowest aggregate passer rating for a Super Bowl . Manning became the oldest quarterback ever to win a Super Bowl at age 39 , and the first quarterback ever to win a Super Bowl with two different teams , while Gary Kubiak became the first head coach to win a Super Bowl with the same franchise he went to the Super Bowl with as a player .
Instruments were marketed by teacher-dealers , much as the title character in the popular musical The Music Man . Often , these teacher-dealers conducted mandolin orchestras : groups of 4-50 musicians who played various mandolin family instruments . However , alongside the teacher-dealers were serious musicians , working to create a spot for the instrument in classical music , ragtime and jazz . Like the teacher-dealers , they traveled the U.S. , recording records , giving performances and teaching individuals and mandolin orchestras . Samuel Siegel played mandolin in Vaudeville and became one of America 's preeminent mandolinists . Seth Weeks was an African American who not only taught and performed in the United States , but also in Europe , where he recorded records . Another pioneering African American musician and director who made his start with a mandolin orchestra was composer James Reese Europe . W. Eugene Page toured the country with a group , and was well known for his mandolin and mandola performances . Other names include Valentine Abt , Samuel Adelstein , William Place , Jr. , and Aubrey Stauffer .
Egypt ( i/ˈiːdʒɪpt/ ; Arabic : مِصر‎ Miṣr , Egyptian Arabic : مَصر Maṣr , Coptic : Ⲭⲏⲙⲓ Khemi ) , officially the Arab Republic of Egypt , is a transcontinental country spanning the northeast corner of Africa and southwest corner of Asia , via a land bridge formed by the Sinai Peninsula . It is the world 's only contiguous Eurafrasian nation . Most of Egypt 's territory of 1,010,408 square kilometres ( 390,000 sq mi ) lies within the Nile Valley . Egypt is a Mediterranean country . It is bordered by the Gaza Strip and Israel to the northeast , the Gulf of Aqaba to the east , the Red Sea to the east and south , Sudan to the south and Libya to the west .
In 2008 [ update ] the total number of full-time equivalent jobs was 125,037 . The number of jobs in the primary sector was 203 , of which 184 were in agriculture and 19 were in forestry or lumber production . The number of jobs in the secondary sector was 15,476 of which 7,650 or ( 49.4 % ) were in manufacturing , 51 or ( 0.3 % ) were in mining and 6,389 ( 41.3 % ) were in construction . The number of jobs in the tertiary sector was 109,358 . In the tertiary sector ; 11,396 or 10.4 % were in wholesale or retail sales or the repair of motor vehicles , 10,293 or 9.4 % were in the movement and storage of goods , 5,090 or 4.7 % were in a hotel or restaurant , 7,302 or 6.7 % were in the information industry , 8,437 or 7.7 % were the insurance or financial industry , 10,660 or 9.7 % were technical professionals or scientists , 5,338 or 4.9 % were in education and 17,903 or 16.4 % were in health care .
The defined dogma of the Immaculate Conception regards original sin only , saying that Mary was preserved from any stain ( in Latin , macula or labes , the second of these two synonymous words being the one used in the formal definition ) . The proclaimed Roman Catholic dogma states " that the most Blessed Virgin Mary , in the first instance of her conception , by a singular grace and privilege granted by Almighty God , in view of the merits of Jesus Christ , the Saviour of the human race , was preserved free from all stain of original sin . " Therefore , being always free from original sin , the doctrine teaches that from her conception Mary received the sanctifying grace that would normally come with baptism after birth .
CBS provided digital streams of the game via CBSSports.com , and the CBS Sports apps on tablets , Windows 10 , Xbox One and other digital media players ( such as Chromecast and Roku ) . Due to Verizon Communications exclusivity , streaming on smartphones was only provided to Verizon Wireless customers via the NFL Mobile service . The ESPN Deportes Spanish broadcast was made available through WatchESPN .
In 1988 , the civil rights leader Jesse Jackson urged Americans to use instead the term " African American " because it had a historical cultural base and was a construction similar to terms used by European descendants , such as German American , Italian American , etc . Since then , African American and black have often had parallel status . However , controversy continues over which if any of the two terms is more appropriate . Maulana Karenga argues that the term African-American is more appropriate because it accurately articulates their geographical and historical origin . [ citation needed ] Others have argued that " black " is a better term because " African " suggests foreignness , although Black Americans helped found the United States . Still others believe that the term black is inaccurate because African Americans have a variety of skin tones . Some surveys suggest that the majority of Black Americans have no preference for " African American " or " Black " , although they have a slight preference for " black " in personal settings and " African American " in more formal settings .
This was the first Super Bowl to feature a quarterback on both teams who was the # 1 pick in their draft classes . Manning was the # 1 selection of the 1998 NFL draft , while Newton was picked first in 2011 . The matchup also pits the top two picks of the 2011 draft against each other : Newton for Carolina and Von Miller for Denver . Manning and Newton also set the record for the largest age difference between opposing Super Bowl quarterbacks at 13 years and 48 days ( Manning was 39 , Newton was 26 ) .
The doctrine of the immaculate conception ( Mary being conceived free from original sin ) is not to be confused with her virginal conception of her son Jesus . This misunderstanding of the term immaculate conception is frequently met in the mass media . Catholics believe that Mary was not the product of a virginal conception herself but was the daughter of a human father and mother , traditionally known by the names of Saint Joachim and Saint Anne . In 1677 , the Holy See condemned the belief that Mary was virginally conceived , which had been a belief surfacing occasionally since the 4th century . The Church celebrates the Feast of the Immaculate Conception ( when Mary was conceived free from original sin ) on 8 December , exactly nine months before celebrating the Nativity of Mary . The feast of the Annunciation ( which commemorates the virginal conception and the Incarnation of Jesus ) is celebrated on 25 March , nine months before Christmas Day .
Some Western writers claim that the immaculate conception of Mary is a teaching of Islam . Thus , commenting in 1734 on the passage in the Qur'an , " I have called her Mary ; and I commend her to thy protection , and also her issue , against Satan driven away with stones " , George Sale stated : " It is not improbable that the pretended immaculate conception of the virgin Mary is intimated in this passage . For according to a tradition of Mohammed , every person that comes into the world , is touched at his birth by the devil , and therefore cries out , Mary and her son only excepted ; between whom , and the evil spirit God placed a veil , so that his touch did not reach them . And for this reason they say , neither of them were guilty of any sin , like the rest of the children of Adam . "
A funicular railway leads from the Marzili district to the Bundeshaus . The Marzilibahn funicular is , with a length of 106 m ( 348 ft ) , the second shortest public railway in Europe after the Zagreb funicular .
Following a lengthy legal battle with the European Commission , which deemed the exclusivity of the rights to be against the interests of competition and the consumer , BSkyB 's monopoly came to an end from the 2007–08 season . In May 2006 , the Irish broadcaster Setanta Sports was awarded two of the six Premier League packages that the English FA offered to broadcasters . Sky picked up the remaining four for £1.3bn . In February 2015 , Sky bid £4.2bn for a package of 120 premier league games across the three seasons from 2016 . This represented an increase of 70 % on the previous contract and was said to be £1bn more than the company had expected to pay . The move has been followed by staff cuts , increased subscription prices ( including 9 % in Sky 's family package ) and the dropping of the 3D channel .
The etymology of the name Bern is uncertain . According to the local legend , based on folk etymology , Berchtold V , Duke of Zähringen , the founder of the city of Bern , vowed to name the city after the first animal he met on the hunt , and this turned out to be a bear . It has long been considered likely that the city was named after the Italian city of Verona , which at the time was known as Bern in Middle High German . As a result of the find of the Bern zinc tablet in the 1980s , it is now more common to assume that the city was named after a pre-existing toponym of Celtic origin , possibly *berna " cleft " . The bear was the heraldic animal of the seal and coat of arms of Bern from at least the 1220s . The earliest reference to the keeping of live bears in the Bärengraben dates to the 1440s .
Bern was the site of the 1954 Football ( Soccer ) World Cup Final , a huge upset for the Hungarian Golden Team , who were beaten 3–2 by West Germany . The football team BSC Young Boys is based in Bern at the Stade de Suisse Wankdorf , which also was one of the venues for the European football championship 2008 in which it hosted 3 matches .
He later attributed his decision to an event : on 2 July 1505 , he was returning to university on horseback after a trip home . During a thunderstorm , a lightning bolt struck near him . Later telling his father he was terrified of death and divine judgment , he cried out , " Help ! Saint Anna , I will become a monk ! " He came to view his cry for help as a vow he could never break . He left law school , sold his books , and entered a closed Augustinian cloister in Erfurt on 17 July 1505 . One friend blamed the decision on Luther 's sadness over the deaths of two friends . Luther himself seemed saddened by the move . Those who attended a farewell supper walked him to the door of the Black Cloister . " This day you see me , and then , not ever again , " he said . His father was furious over what he saw as a waste of Luther 's education .
The canal is 193.30 km ( 120.11 mi ) long , 24 m ( 79 ft ) deep and 205 metres ( 673 ft ) wide as of 2010 . It consists of the northern access channel of 22 km ( 14 mi ) , the canal itself of 162.25 km ( 100.82 mi ) and the southern access channel of 9 km ( 5.6 mi ) . The canal is a single lane with passing places in the " Ballah By-Pass " and the Great Bitter Lake . It contains no locks ; seawater flows freely through the canal . In general , the canal north of the Bitter Lakes flows north in winter and south in summer . The current south of the lakes changes with the tide at Suez .
With Rivera having been a linebacker with the Chicago Bears in Super Bowl XX , and Kubiak replacing Elway at the end of the Broncos ' defeats in Super Bowls XXI and XXIV , this will be the first Super Bowl in which both head coaches played in the game themselves .
The relative reactivity of zinc and its ability to attract oxidation to itself makes it an efficient sacrificial anode in cathodic protection ( CP ) . For example , cathodic protection of a buried pipeline can be achieved by connecting anodes made from zinc to the pipe . Zinc acts as the anode ( negative terminus ) by slowly corroding away as it passes electric current to the steel pipeline . [ note 2 ] Zinc is also used to cathodically protect metals that are exposed to sea water from corrosion . A zinc disc attached to a ship 's iron rudder will slowly corrode , whereas the rudder stays unattacked . Other similar uses include a plug of zinc attached to a propeller or the metal protective guard for the keel of the ship .
The production for sulfidic zinc ores produces large amounts of sulfur dioxide and cadmium vapor . Smelter slag and other residues of process also contain significant amounts of heavy metals . About 1.1 million tonnes of metallic zinc and 130 thousand tonnes of lead were mined and smelted in the Belgian towns of La Calamine and Plombières between 1806 and 1882 . The dumps of the past mining operations leach significant amounts of zinc and cadmium , and , as a result , the sediments of the Geul River contain significant amounts of heavy metals . About two thousand years ago emissions of zinc from mining and smelting totaled 10 thousand tonnes a year . After increasing 10-fold from 1850 , zinc emissions peaked at 3.4 million tonnes per year in the 1980s and declined to 2.7 million tonnes in the 1990s , although a 2005 study of the Arctic troposphere found that the concentrations there did not reflect the decline . Anthropogenic and natural emissions occur at a ratio of 20 to 1 .
Bern has an area , as of 2009 [ update ] , of 51.62 square kilometers ( 19.93 sq mi ) . Of this area , 9.79 square kilometers ( 3.78 sq mi ) or 19.0 % is used for agricultural purposes , while 17.33 square kilometers ( 6.69 sq mi ) or 33.6 % is forested . Of the rest of the land , 23.25 square kilometers ( 8.98 sq mi ) or 45.0 % is settled ( buildings or roads ) , 1.06 square kilometers ( 0.41 sq mi ) or 2.1 % is either rivers or lakes and 0.16 square kilometers ( 0.062 sq mi ) or 0.3 % is unproductive land .
In response , the EU decided to fill the gap left behind by the US under the Sandbaek report . According to its Annual Report for 2008 , the UNFPA received its funding mainly from European Governments : Of the total income of M845.3 M , $ 118 was donated by the Netherlands , $ 67 M by Sweden , $ 62 M by Norway , $ 54 M by Denmark , $ 53 M by the UK , $ 52 M by Spain , $ 19 M by Luxembourg . The European Commission donated further $ 36 M. The most important non-European donor State was Japan ( $ 36 M ) . The number of donors exceeded 180 in one year .
Luther sympathised with some of the peasants ' grievances , as he showed in his response to the Twelve Articles in May 1525 , but he reminded the aggrieved to obey the temporal authorities . During a tour of Thuringia , he became enraged at the widespread burning of convents , monasteries , bishops ' palaces , and libraries . In Against the Murderous , Thieving Hordes of Peasants , written on his return to Wittenberg , he gave his interpretation of the Gospel teaching on wealth , condemned the violence as the devil 's work , and called for the nobles to put down the rebels like mad dogs :
As the designated home team in the annual rotation between AFC and NFC teams , the Broncos elected to wear their road white jerseys with matching white pants . Elway stated , " We 've had Super Bowl success in our white uniforms . " The Broncos last wore matching white jerseys and pants in the Super Bowl in Super Bowl XXXIII , Elway 's last game as Denver QB , when they defeated the Atlanta Falcons 34–19 . In their only other Super Bowl win in Super Bowl XXXII , Denver wore blue jerseys , which was their primary color at the time . They also lost Super Bowl XXI when they wore white jerseys , but they are 0-4 in Super Bowls when wearing orange jerseys , losing in Super Bowl XII , XXII , XXIV , and XLVIII . The only other AFC champion team to have worn white as the designated home team in the Super Bowl was the Pittsburgh Steelers ; they defeated the Seattle Seahawks 21–10 in Super Bowl XL 10 seasons prior . The Broncos ' decision to wear white meant the Panthers would wear their standard home uniform : black jerseys with silver pants .
Luther and his wife moved into a former monastery , " The Black Cloister , " a wedding present from the new elector John the Steadfast ( 1525–32 ) . They embarked on what appeared to have been a happy and successful marriage , though money was often short . Between bearing six children , Hans – June 1526 ; Elizabeth – 10 December 1527 , who died within a few months ; Magdalene – 1529 , who died in Luther 's arms in 1542 ; Martin – 1531 ; Paul – January 1533 ; and Margaret – 1534 ; Katharina helped the couple earn a living by farming the land and taking in boarders . Luther confided to Michael Stiefel on 11 August 1526 : " My Katie is in all things so obliging and pleasing to me that I would not exchange my poverty for the riches of Croesus . "
Economic conditions have started to improve considerably , after a period of stagnation , due to the adoption of more liberal economic policies by the government as well as increased revenues from tourism and a booming stock market . In its annual report , the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) has rated Egypt as one of the top countries in the world undertaking economic reforms . Some major economic reforms undertaken by the government since 2003 include a dramatic slashing of customs and tariffs . A new taxation law implemented in 2005 decreased corporate taxes from 40 % to the current 20 % , resulting in a stated 100 % increase in tax revenue by the year 2006 .
Other than by appearance , " Coloureds " can usually be distinguished from " Blacks " by language . Most speak Afrikaans or English as a first language , as opposed to Bantu languages such as Zulu or Xhosa . They also tend to have more European-sounding names than Bantu names .
The Ten Commandments , and the beginnings of the renewed life of Christians accorded to them by the sacrament of baptism , are a present foreshadowing of the believers ' future angel-like life in heaven in the midst of this life . Luther 's teaching of the Ten Commandments , therefore , has clear eschatological overtones , which , characteristically for Luther , do not encourage world-flight but direct the Christian to service to the neighbor in the common , daily vocations of this perishing world .
Until 1917 , it was possible for someone who was not a priest , but only in minor orders , to become a cardinal ( see " lay cardinals " , below ) , but they were enrolled only in the order of cardinal deacons . For example , in the 16th century , Reginald Pole was a cardinal for 18 years before he was ordained a priest . In 1917 it was established that all cardinals , even cardinal deacons , had to be priests , and , in 1962 , Pope John XXIII set the norm that all cardinals be ordained as bishops , even if they are only priests at the time of appointment . As a consequence of these two changes , canon 351 of the 1983 Code of Canon Law requires that a cardinal be at least in the order of priesthood at his appointment , and that those who are not already bishops must receive episcopal consecration . Several cardinals aged over 80 or close to it when appointed have obtained dispensation from the rule of having to be a bishop . These were all appointed cardinal-deacons , but one of them , Roberto Tucci , lived long enough to exercise the right of option and be promoted to the rank of cardinal-priest .
The Panthers defense gave up just 308 points , ranking sixth in the league , while also leading the NFL in interceptions with 24 and boasting four Pro Bowl selections . Pro Bowl defensive tackle Kawann Short led the team in sacks with 11 , while also forcing three fumbles and recovering two . Fellow lineman Mario Addison added 6½ sacks . The Panthers line also featured veteran defensive end Jared Allen , a 5-time pro bowler who was the NFL 's active career sack leader with 136 , along with defensive end Kony Ealy , who had 5 sacks in just 9 starts . Behind them , two of the Panthers three starting linebackers were also selected to play in the Pro Bowl : Thomas Davis and Luke Kuechly . Davis compiled 5½ sacks , four forced fumbles , and four interceptions , while Kuechly led the team in tackles ( 118 ) forced two fumbles , and intercepted four passes of his own . Carolina 's secondary featured Pro Bowl safety Kurt Coleman , who led the team with a career high seven interceptions , while also racking up 88 tackles and Pro Bowl cornerback Josh Norman , who developed into a shutdown corner during the season and had four interceptions , two of which were returned for touchdowns .
On the other hand , Luther also points out that the Ten Commandments – when considered not as God 's condemning judgment but as an expression of his eternal will , that is , of the natural law – also positively teach how the Christian ought to live . This has traditionally been called the " third use of the law . " For Luther , also Christ 's life , when understood as an example , is nothing more than an illustration of the Ten Commandments , which a Christian should follow in his or her vocations on a daily basis .
The CBS Records Group was led very successfully by Clive Davis until his dismissal in 1972 , after it was discovered that Davis has used CBS funds to finance his personal life , including an expensive bar mitzvah party for his son . He was replaced first by former head Goddard Lieberson , then in 1975 by the colourful and controversial lawyer Walter Yetnikoff , who led the company until 1990 .
One of the most influential works during this burgeoning period was Niccolò Machiavelli 's The Prince , written between 1511–12 and published in 1532 , after Machiavelli 's death . That work , as well as The Discourses , a rigorous analysis of the classical period , did much to influence modern political thought in the West . A minority ( including Jean-Jacques Rousseau ) interpreted The Prince as a satire meant to be given to the Medici after their recapture of Florence and their subsequent expulsion of Machiavelli from Florence . Though the work was written for the di Medici family in order to perhaps influence them to free him from exile , Machiavelli supported the Republic of Florence rather than the oligarchy of the di Medici family . At any rate , Machiavelli presents a pragmatic and somewhat consequentialist view of politics , whereby good and evil are mere means used to bring about an end—i.e. , the secure and powerful state . Thomas Hobbes , well known for his theory of the social contract , goes on to expand this view at the start of the 17th century during the English Renaissance . Although neither Machiavelli nor Hobbes believed in the divine right of kings , they both believed in the inherent selfishness of the individual . It was necessarily this belief that led them to adopt a strong central power as the only means of preventing the disintegration of the social order .
Luther 's 1541 hymn " Christ unser Herr zum Jordan kam " ( " To Jordan came the Christ our Lord " ) reflects the structure and substance of his questions and answers concerning baptism in the Small Catechism . Luther adopted a preexisting Johann Walter tune associated with a hymnic setting of Psalm 67 's prayer for grace ; Wolf Heintz 's four-part setting of the hymn was used to introduce the Lutheran Reformation in Halle in 1541 . Preachers and composers of the 18th century , including J. S. Bach , used this rich hymn as a subject for their own work , although its objective baptismal theology was displaced by more subjective hymns under the influence of late-19th-century Lutheran pietism .
The service started on 1 September 1993 based on the idea from the then chief executive officer , Sam Chisholm and Rupert Murdoch , of converting the company business strategy to an entirely fee-based concept . The new package included four channels formerly available free-to-air , broadcasting on Astra 's satellites , as well as introducing new channels . The service continued until the closure of BSkyB 's analogue service on 27 September 2001 , due to the launch and expansion of the Sky Digital platform . Some of the channels did broadcast either in the clear or soft encrypted ( whereby a Videocrypt decoder was required to decode , without a subscription card ) prior to their addition to the Sky Multichannels package . Within two months of the launch , BSkyB gained 400,000 new subscribers , with the majority taking at least one premium channel as well , which helped BSkyB reach 3.5 million households by mid-1994 . Michael Grade criticized the operations in front of the Select Committee on National Heritage , mainly for the lack of original programming on many of the new channels .
Luther had published his German translation of the New Testament in 1522 , and he and his collaborators completed the translation of the Old Testament in 1534 , when the whole Bible was published . He continued to work on refining the translation until the end of his life . Others had translated the Bible into German , but Luther tailored his translation to his own doctrine . When he was criticised for inserting the word " alone " after " faith " in Romans 3:28 , he replied in part : " [ T ] he text itself and the meaning of St. Paul urgently require and demand it . For in that very passage he is dealing with the main point of Christian doctrine , namely , that we are justified by faith in Christ without any works of the Law . ... But when works are so completely cut away – and that must mean that faith alone justifies – whoever would speak plainly and clearly about this cutting away of works will have to say , 'Faith alone justifies us , and not works ' . "
The Daily Mail newspaper reported in 2012 that the UK government 's benefits agency was checking claimants ' " Sky TV bills to establish if a woman in receipt of benefits as a single mother is wrongly claiming to be living alone " – as , it claimed , subscription to sports channels would betray a man 's presence in the household . In December , the UK ’ s parliament heard a claim that a subscription to BSkyB was ‘ often damaging ’ , along with alcohol , tobacco and gambling . Conservative MP Alec Shelbrooke was proposing the payments of benefits and tax credits on a " Welfare Cash Card " , in the style of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program , that could be used to buy only " essentials " .
Luther 's translation used the variant of German spoken at the Saxon chancellery , intelligible to both northern and southern Germans . He intended his vigorous , direct language to make the Bible accessible to everyday Germans , " for we are removing impediments and difficulties so that other people may read it without hindrance . "
Beginning several centuries ago , during the period of the Ottoman Empire , tens of thousands of Black Africans were brought by slave traders to plantations and agricultural areas situated between Antalya and Istanbul in present-day Turkey . Some of their descendants remained in situ , and many migrated to larger cities and towns . Other blacks slaves were transported to Crete , from where they or their descendants later reached the İzmir area through the population exchange between Greece and Turkey in 1923 , or indirectly from Ayvalık in pursuit of work .
As opposed to broadcasts of primetime series , CBS broadcast special episodes of its late night talk shows as its lead-out programs for Super Bowl 50 , beginning with a special episode of The Late Show with Stephen Colbert following the game . Following a break for late local programming , CBS also aired a special episode of The Late Late Show with James Corden .
According to scholars Walter Krämer , Götz Trenkler , Gerhard Ritter , and Gerhard Prause , the story of the posting on the door , even though it has settled as one of the pillars of history , has little foundation in truth . The story is based on comments made by Philipp Melanchthon , though it is thought that he was not in Wittenberg at the time .
However , according to then-Secretary of State Colin Powell , the UNFPA contributed vehicles and computers to the Chinese to carry out their population control policies . However , both the Washington Post and the Washington Times reported that Powell simply fell in line , signing a brief written by someone else .
On July 1 , 2009 , SME and IODA announced their global strategic partnership to leverage combined worldwide online retail distribution networks and complementary technologies to support independent labels and music rightsholders .
The official language of the Republic is Modern Standard Arabic . Arabic was adopted by the Egyptians after the Arab invasion of Egypt . The spoken languages are : Egyptian Arabic ( 68 % ) , Sa'idi Arabic ( 29 % ) , Eastern Egyptian Bedawi Arabic ( 1.6 % ) , Sudanese Arabic ( 0.6 % ) , Domari ( 0.3 % ) , Nobiin ( 0.3 % ) , Beja ( 0.1 % ) , Siwi and others . Additionally , Greek , Armenian and Italian are the main languages of immigrants . In Alexandria in the 19th century there was a large community of Italian Egyptians and Italian was the " lingua franca " of the city .

In the 1980s , 1990s , and 2000s , terrorist attacks in Egypt became numerous and severe , and began to target Christian Copts , foreign tourists and government officials . In the 1990s an Islamist group , Al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya , engaged in an extended campaign of violence , from the murders and attempted murders of prominent writers and intellectuals , to the repeated targeting of tourists and foreigners . Serious damage was done to the largest sector of Egypt 's economy—tourism—and in turn to the government , but it also devastated the livelihoods of many of the people on whom the group depended for support .
Hard rock entered the 1990s as one of the dominant forms of commercial music . The multi-platinum releases of AC/DC 's The Razors Edge ( 1990 ) , Guns N ' Roses ' Use Your Illusion I and Use Your Illusion II ( both in 1991 ) , Ozzy Osbourne 's No More Tears ( 1991 ) , and Van Halen 's For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge ( 1991 ) showcased this popularity . Additionally , The Black Crowes released their debut album , Shake Your Money Maker ( 1990 ) , which contained a bluesy classic rock sound and sold five million copies . In 1992 , Def Leppard followed up 1987 's Hysteria with Adrenalize , which went multi-platinum , spawned four Top 40 singles and held the number one spot on the US album chart for five weeks .
According to scholars Walter Krämer , Götz Trenkler , Gerhard Ritter , and Gerhard Prause , the story of the posting on the door , even though it has settled as one of the pillars of history , has little foundation in truth . The story is based on comments made by Philipp Melanchthon , though it is thought that he was not in Wittenberg at the time .
Luther 's hymns inspired composers to write music . Johann Sebastian Bach included several verses as chorales in his cantatas and based chorale cantatas entirely on them , namely Christ lag in Todes Banden , BWV 4 , as early as possibly 1707 , in his second annual cycle ( 1724 to 1725 ) Ach Gott , vom Himmel sieh darein , BWV 2 , Christ unser Herr zum Jordan kam , BWV 7 , Nun komm , der Heiden Heiland , BWV 62 , Gelobet seist du , Jesu Christ , BWV 91 , and Aus tiefer Not schrei ich zu dir , BWV 38 , later Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott , BWV 80 , and in 1735 Wär Gott nicht mit uns diese Zeit , BWV 14 .
In addition , there are $ 2 million worth of other ancillary events , including a week-long event at the Santa Clara Convention Center , a beer , wine and food festival at Bellomy Field at Santa Clara University , and a pep rally . A professional fundraiser will aid in finding business sponsors and individual donors , but still may need the city council to help fund the event . Additional funding will be provided by the city council , which has announced plans to set aside seed funding for the event .
The negotiations were successfully concluded on 17 February 1546 . After 8 a.m. , he experienced chest pains . When he went to his bed , he prayed , " Into your hand I commit my spirit ; you have redeemed me , O Lord , faithful God " ( Ps . 31:5 ) , the common prayer of the dying . At 1 a.m. he awoke with more chest pain and was warmed with hot towels . He thanked God for revealing his Son to him in whom he had believed . His companions , Justus Jonas and Michael Coelius , shouted loudly , " Reverend father , are you ready to die trusting in your Lord Jesus Christ and to confess the doctrine which you have taught in his name ? " A distinct " Yes " was Luther 's reply .
The House of Representatives , whose members are elected to serve five-year terms , specialises in legislation . Elections were last held between November 2011 and January 2012 which was later dissolved . The next parliamentary election will be held within 6 months of the constitution 's ratification on 18 January 2014 . Originally , the parliament was to be formed before the president was elected , but interim president Adly Mansour pushed the date . The Egyptian presidential election , 2014 , took place on 26–28 May 2014 . Official figures showed a turnout of 25,578,233 or 47.5 % , with Abdel Fattah el-Sisi winning with 23.78 million votes , or 96.91 % compared to 757,511 ( 3.09 % ) for Hamdeen Sabahi .
The Daily Mail newspaper reported in 2012 that the UK government 's benefits agency was checking claimants ' " Sky TV bills to establish if a woman in receipt of benefits as a single mother is wrongly claiming to be living alone " – as , it claimed , subscription to sports channels would betray a man 's presence in the household . In December , the UK ’ s parliament heard a claim that a subscription to BSkyB was ‘ often damaging ’ , along with alcohol , tobacco and gambling . Conservative MP Alec Shelbrooke was proposing the payments of benefits and tax credits on a " Welfare Cash Card " , in the style of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program , that could be used to buy only " essentials " .
Scholars disagree over the effects of social status on racial classifications in Brazil . It is generally believed that achieving upward mobility and education results in individuals being classified as a category of lighter skin . The popular claim is that in Brazil , poor whites are considered black and wealthy blacks are considered white . Some scholars disagree , arguing that " whitening " of one 's social status may be open to people of mixed race , a large part of the population known as pardo , but a person perceived as preto ( black ) will continue to be classified as black regardless of wealth or social status .
Luther 's disappearance during his return trip back to Wittenberg was planned . Frederick III had him intercepted on his way home in the forest near Wittenberg by masked horsemen who were made to appear as armed highwaymen . They escorted Luther to the security of the Wartburg Castle at Eisenach . During his stay at Wartburg , which he referred to as " my Patmos " , Luther translated the New Testament from Greek into German and poured out doctrinal and polemical writings . These included a renewed attack on Archbishop Albrecht of Mainz , whom he shamed into halting the sale of indulgences in his episcopates , and a " Refutation of the Argument of Latomus , " in which he expounded the principle of justification to Jacobus Latomus , an orthodox theologian from Louvain .
In the United States , the game was televised by CBS , as part of a cycle between the three main broadcast television partners of the NFL . The network 's lead broadcast team of Jim Nantz and Phil Simms called the contest , with Tracy Wolfson and Evan Washburn on the sidelines . CBS introduced new features during the telecast , including pylon cameras and microphones along with EyeVision 360—an array of 36 cameras along the upper deck that can be used to provide a 360-degree view of plays and " bullet time " effects . ( An earlier version of EyeVision was last used in Super Bowl XXXV ; for Super Bowl 50 , the cameras were upgraded to 5K resolution . )
In the 18th century , the Moroccan Sultan Moulay Ismail " the Bloodthirsty " ( 1672–1727 ) raised a corps of 150,000 black slaves , called his Black Guard , who coerced the country into submission .
In September 2015 , the 193 member states of the United Nations unanimously adopted the Sustainable Development Goals , a set of 17 goals aiming to transform the world over the next 15 years . These goals are designed to eliminate poverty , discrimination , abuse and preventable deaths , address environmental destruction , and usher in an era of development for all people , everywhere .
His poor physical health made him short-tempered and even harsher in his writings and comments . His wife Katharina was overheard saying , " Dear husband , you are too rude , " and he responded , " They are teaching me to be rude . " In 1545 and 1546 Luther preached three times in the Market Church in Halle , staying with his friend Justus Jonas during Christmas .
On the island of Crete , along with the lyra and the laouto ( lute ) , the mandolin is one of the main instruments used in Cretan Music . It appeared on Crete around the time of the Venetian rule of the island . Different variants of the mandolin , such as the " mantola , " were used to accompany the lyra , the violin , and the laouto . Stelios Foustalierakis reported that the mandolin and the mpoulgari were used to accompany the lyra in the beginning of the 20th century in the city of Rethimno . There are also reports that the mandolin was mostly a woman 's musical instrument . Nowadays it is played mainly as a solo instrument in personal and family events on the Ionian islands and Crete .
The etymology of the name Bern is uncertain . According to the local legend , based on folk etymology , Berchtold V , Duke of Zähringen , the founder of the city of Bern , vowed to name the city after the first animal he met on the hunt , and this turned out to be a bear . It has long been considered likely that the city was named after the Italian city of Verona , which at the time was known as Bern in Middle High German . As a result of the find of the Bern zinc tablet in the 1980s , it is now more common to assume that the city was named after a pre-existing toponym of Celtic origin , possibly *berna " cleft " . The bear was the heraldic animal of the seal and coat of arms of Bern from at least the 1220s . The earliest reference to the keeping of live bears in the Bärengraben dates to the 1440s .
Numerous communities of dark-skinned peoples are present in North Africa , some dating from prehistoric communities . Others are descendants of the historical Trans-Saharan trade in peoples and/or , and after the Arab invasions of North Africa in the 7th century , descendants of slaves from the Arab Slave Trade in North Africa .
The production for sulfidic zinc ores produces large amounts of sulfur dioxide and cadmium vapor . Smelter slag and other residues of process also contain significant amounts of heavy metals . About 1.1 million tonnes of metallic zinc and 130 thousand tonnes of lead were mined and smelted in the Belgian towns of La Calamine and Plombières between 1806 and 1882 . The dumps of the past mining operations leach significant amounts of zinc and cadmium , and , as a result , the sediments of the Geul River contain significant amounts of heavy metals . About two thousand years ago emissions of zinc from mining and smelting totaled 10 thousand tonnes a year . After increasing 10-fold from 1850 , zinc emissions peaked at 3.4 million tonnes per year in the 1980s and declined to 2.7 million tonnes in the 1990s , although a 2005 study of the Arctic troposphere found that the concentrations there did not reflect the decline . Anthropogenic and natural emissions occur at a ratio of 20 to 1 .
Egypt recognises only three religions : Islam , Christianity , and Judaism . Other faiths and minority Muslim sects practised by Egyptians , such as the small Bahá'í and Ahmadi community , are not recognised by the state and face persecution since they are labelled as far right groups that threaten Egypt 's national security . Individuals , particularly Baha'is and atheists , wishing to include their religion ( or lack thereof ) on their mandatory state issued identification cards are denied this ability ( see Egyptian identification card controversy ) , and are put in the position of either not obtaining required identification or lying about their faith . A 2008 court ruling allowed members of unrecognised faiths to obtain identification and leave the religion field blank .

QuickBooks sponsored a " Small Business Big Game " contest , in which Death Wish Coffee had a 30-second commercial aired free of charge courtesy of QuickBooks . Death Wish Coffee beat out nine other contenders from across the United States for the free advertisement .
Super Bowl 50 featured numerous records from individuals and teams . Denver won despite being massively outgained in total yards ( 315 to 194 ) and first downs ( 21 to 11 ) . Their 194 yards and 11 first downs were both the lowest totals ever by a Super Bowl winning team . The previous record was 244 yards by the Baltimore Ravens in Super Bowl XXXV . Only seven other teams had ever gained less than 200 yards in a Super Bowl , and all of them had lost . The Broncos ' seven sacks tied a Super Bowl record set by the Chicago Bears in Super Bowl XX . Kony Ealy tied a Super Bowl record with three sacks . Jordan Norwood 's 61-yard punt return set a new record , surpassing the old record of 45 yards set by John Taylor in Super Bowl XXIII . Denver was just 1-of-14 on third down , while Carolina was barely better at 3-of-15 . The two teams ' combined third down conversion percentage of 13.8 was a Super Bowl low . Manning and Newton had quarterback passer ratings of 56.6 and 55.4 , respectively , and their added total of 112 is a record lowest aggregate passer rating for a Super Bowl . Manning became the oldest quarterback ever to win a Super Bowl at age 39 , and the first quarterback ever to win a Super Bowl with two different teams , while Gary Kubiak became the first head coach to win a Super Bowl with the same franchise he went to the Super Bowl with as a player .
In 2004 , SME and Bertelsmann Music Group merged as Sony BMG Music Entertainment . When Sony acquired BMG 's half of the conglomerate in 2008 , Sony BMG reverted to the SME name . The buyout led to the dissolution of BMG , which then relaunched as BMG Rights Management . Out of the " Big Three " record companies , with Universal Music Group being the largest and Warner Music Group , SME is middle-sized .
After Morsi was ousted by the military , the judiciary system aligned itself with the new government , actively suopporting the repression of Muslim Brotherhood members . This resulted in a sharp increase in mass death sentences that arose criticism from the US president Barack Obama and the General Secretary of the UN , Ban Ki Moon . In April 2013 , one judge of the Minya governatorate of Upper Egypt , sentenced 1,212 people to death . In December 2014 the judge Mohammed Nagi Shahata , notorious for his fierceness in passing on death sentences , condemened to the capital penalty 188 members of the Muslim Brotherhood , for assaulting a police station . Various Egyptian and international human rights organisations have already pointed out the lack of fair trials , that often last only a few minutes and do not take into consideration the procedural standards of fair trials .
The city council of the city of Bern decided against having twinned cities except for a temporary ( during the UEFA Euro 2008 ) cooperation with the Austrian city Salzburg
In the Middle Ages , Virgil 's reputation was such that it inspired legends associating him with magic and prophecy . From at least the 3rd century , Christian thinkers interpreted Eclogues 4 , which describes the birth of a boy ushering in a golden age , as a prediction of Jesus ' birth . As such , Virgil came to be seen on a similar level as the Hebrew prophets of the Bible as one who had heralded Christianity .
The city grew out towards the west of the boundaries of the peninsula formed by the River Aare . The Zytglogge tower marked the western boundary of the city from 1191 until 1256 , when the Käfigturm took over this role until 1345 . It was , in turn , succeeded by the Christoffelturm ( formerly located close to the site of the modern-day railway station ) until 1622 . During the time of the Thirty Years ' War , two new fortifications – the so-called big and small Schanze ( entrenchment ) – were built to protect the whole area of the peninsula .
The Roman Missal and the Roman Rite Liturgy of the Hours naturally includes references to Mary 's immaculate conception in the feast of the Immaculate Conception . An example is the antiphon that begins : " Tota pulchra es , Maria , et macula originalis non est in te " ( You are all beautiful , Mary , and the original stain [ of sin ] is not in you . Your clothing is white as snow , and your face is like the sun . You are all beautiful , Mary , and the original stain [ of sin ] is not in you . You are the glory of Jerusalem , you are the joy of Israel , you give honour to our people . You are all beautiful , Mary . ) On the basis of the original Gregorian chant music , polyphonic settings have been composed by Anton Bruckner , Pablo Casals , Maurice Duruflé , Grzegorz Gerwazy Gorczycki , no : Ola Gjeilo , José Maurício Nunes Garcia , and Nikolaus Schapfl ,
Pope Leo X was used to reformers and heretics , and he responded slowly , " with great care as is proper . " Over the next three years he deployed a series of papal theologians and envoys against Luther , which served only to harden the reformer 's anti-papal theology . First , the Dominican theologian Sylvester Mazzolini drafted a heresy case against Luther , whom Leo then summoned to Rome . The Elector Frederick persuaded the pope to have Luther examined at Augsburg , where the Imperial Diet was held . There , in October 1518 , under questioning by papal legate Cardinal Cajetan Luther stated that he did not consider the papacy part of the biblical Church because historistical interpretation of Bible prophecy concluded that the papacy was the Antichrist . The prophecies concerning the Antichrist soon became the center of controversy . The hearings degenerated into a shouting match . More than his writing the 95 Theses , Luther 's confrontation with the church cast him as an enemy of the pope . Cajetan 's original instructions had been to arrest Luther if he failed to recant , but the legate desisted from doing so . Luther slipped out of the city at night , unbeknownst to Cajetan .
By that time , the majority of black people in the United States were native-born , so the use of the term " African " became problematic . Though initially a source of pride , many blacks feared that the use of African as an identity would be a hindrance to their fight for full citizenship in the US . They also felt that it would give ammunition to those who were advocating repatriating black people back to Africa . In 1835 , black leaders called upon Black Americans to remove the title of " African " from their institutions and replace it with " Negro " or " Colored American " . A few institutions chose to keep their historic names , such as the African Methodist Episcopal Church . African Americans popularly used the terms " Negro " or " colored " for themselves until the late 1960s .
In this work , one of his most emphatic statements on faith , he argued that every good work designed to attract God 's favor is a sin . All humans are sinners by nature , he explained , and God 's grace ( which can not be earned ) alone can make them just . On 1 August 1521 , Luther wrote to Melanchthon on the same theme : " Be a sinner , and let your sins be strong , but let your trust in Christ be stronger , and rejoice in Christ who is the victor over sin , death , and the world . We will commit sins while we are here , for this life is not a place where justice resides . "
A psychological identity relates to self-image ( one 's mental model of oneself ) , self-esteem , and individuality . Consequently , Weinreich gives the definition " A person 's identity is defined as the totality of one 's self-construal , in which how one construes oneself in the present expresses the continuity between how one construes oneself as one was in the past and how one construes oneself as one aspires to be in the future " ; this allows for definitions of aspects of identity , such as : " One 's ethnic identity is defined as that part of the totality of one 's self-construal made up of those dimensions that express the continuity between one 's construal of past ancestry and one 's future aspirations in relation to ethnicity " ( Weinreich , 1986a ) .
Another debate developed around the ( distinct ) criticisms of liberal political theory made by Michael Walzer , Michael Sandel and Charles Taylor . The liberal-communitarian debate is often considered valuable for generating a new set of philosophical problems , rather than a profound and illuminating clash of perspective.These and other communitarians ( such as Alasdair MacIntyre and Daniel A . Bell ) argue that , contra liberalism , communities are prior to individuals and therefore should be the center of political focus . Communitarians tend to support greater local control as well as economic and social policies which encourage the growth of social capital .
The works of Virgil almost from the moment of their publication revolutionized Latin poetry . The Eclogues , Georgics , and above all the Aeneid became standard texts in school curricula with which all educated Romans were familiar . Poets following Virgil often refer intertextually to his works to generate meaning in their own poetry . The Augustan poet Ovid parodies the opening lines of the Aeneid in Amores 1.1.1–2 , and his summary of the Aeneas story in Book 14 of the Metamorphoses , the so-called " mini-Aeneid " , has been viewed as a particularly important example of post-Virgilian response to the epic genre . Lucan 's epic , the Bellum Civile has been considered an anti-Virgilian epic , disposing with the divine mechanism , treating historical events , and diverging drastically from Virgilian epic practice . The Flavian poet Statius in his 12-book epic Thebaid engages closely with the poetry of Virgil ; in his epilogue he advises his poem not to " rival the divine Aeneid , but follow afar and ever venerate its footsteps . " In Silius Italicus , Virgil finds one of his most ardent admirers . With almost every line of his epic Punica Silius references Virgil . Indeed , Silius is known to have bought Virgil 's tomb and worshipped the poet . Partially as a result of his so-called " Messianic " Fourth Eclogue—widely interpreted later to have predicted the birth of Jesus Christ—Virgil was in later antiquity imputed to have the magical abilities of a seer ; the Sortes Vergilianae , the process of using Virgil 's poetry as a tool of divination , is found in the time of Hadrian , and continued into the Middle Ages . In a similar vein Macrobius in the Saturnalia credits the work of Virgil as the embodiment of human knowledge and experience , mirroring the Greek conception of Homer . Virgil also found commentators in antiquity . Servius , a commentator of the 4th century AD , based his work on the commentary of Donatus . Servius ' commentary provides us with a great deal of information about Virgil 's life , sources , and references ; however , many modern scholars find the variable quality of his work and the often simplistic interpretations frustrating .
At the time of the fall of the Egyptian monarchy in the early 1950s , less than half a million Egyptians were considered upper class and rich , four million middle class and 17 million lower class and poor . Fewer than half of all primary-school-age children attended school , most of them being boys . Nasser 's policies changed this . Land reform and distribution , the dramatic growth in university education , and government support to national industries greatly improved social mobility and flattened the social curve . From academic year 1953-54 through 1965-66 , overall public school enrolments more than doubled . Millions of previously poor Egyptians , through education and jobs in the public sector , joined the middle class . Doctors , engineers , teachers , lawyers , journalists , constituted the bulk of the swelling middle class in Egypt under Nasser . During the 1960s , the Egyptian economy went from sluggish to the verge of collapse , the society became less free , and Nasser 's appeal waned considerably .
As in Brazil , the mandolin has played an important role in the Music of Venezuela . It has enjoyed a privileged position as the main melodic instrument in several different regions of the country . Specifically , the eastern states of Sucre , Nueva Esparta , Anzoategui and Monagas have made the mandolin the main instrument in their versions of Joropo as well as Puntos , Jotas , Polos , Fulias , Merengues and Malagueñas . Also , in the west of the country the sound of the mandolin is intrinsically associated with the regional genres of the Venezuelan Andes : Bambucos , Pasillos , Pasodobles , and Waltzes . In the western city of Maracaibo the Mandolin has been played in Decimas , Danzas and Contradanzas Zulianas ; in the capital , Caracas , the Merengue Rucaneao , Pasodobles and Waltzes have also been played with mandolin for almost a century . Today , Venezuelan mandolists include an important group of virtuoso players and ensembles such as Alberto Valderrama , Jesus Rengel , Ricardo Sandoval , Saul Vera , and Cristobal Soto .
Sometime after the publication of the Eclogues ( probably before 37 BC ) , Virgil became part of the circle of Maecenas , Octavian 's capable agent d'affaires who sought to counter sympathy for Antony among the leading families by rallying Roman literary figures to Octavian 's side . Virgil came to know many of the other leading literary figures of the time , including Horace , in whose poetry he is often mentioned , and Varius Rufus , who later helped finish the Aeneid .
The First Intermediate Period ushered in a time of political upheaval for about 150 years . Stronger Nile floods and stabilisation of government , however , brought back renewed prosperity for the country in the Middle Kingdom c. 2040 BC , reaching a peak during the reign of Pharaoh Amenemhat III . A second period of disunity heralded the arrival of the first foreign ruling dynasty in Egypt , that of the Semitic Hyksos . The Hyksos invaders took over much of Lower Egypt around 1650 BC and founded a new capital at Avaris . They were driven out by an Upper Egyptian force led by Ahmose I , who founded the Eighteenth Dynasty and relocated the capital from Memphis to Thebes .
The Sydney Mandolins ( Artistic Director : Adrian Hooper ) have contributed greatly to the repertoire through commissioning over 200 works by Australian and International composers . Most of these works have been released on Compact Disks and can regularly be heard on radio stations on the ABC and MBS networks . One of their members , mandolin virtuoso Paul Hooper , has had a number of Concertos written for him by composers such as Eric Gross . He has performed and recorded these works with the Sydney Symphony Orchestra and the Tasmanian Symphony Orchestra . As well , Paul Hooper has had many solo works dedicated to him by Australian composers e.g. , Caroline Szeto , Ian Shanahan , Larry Sitsky and Michael Smetanin .
Communism remained an important focus especially during the 1950s and 1960s . Colonialism and racism were important issues that arose . In general , there was a marked trend towards a pragmatic approach to political issues , rather than a philosophical one . Much academic debate regarded one or both of two pragmatic topics : how ( or whether ) to apply utilitarianism to problems of political policy , or how ( or whether ) to apply economic models ( such as rational choice theory ) to political issues . The rise of feminism , LGBT social movements and the end of colonial rule and of the political exclusion of such minorities as African Americans and sexual minorities in the developed world has led to feminist , postcolonial , and multicultural thought becoming significant . This led to a challenge to the social contract by philosophers Charles W. Mills in his book The Racial Contract and Carole Patemen in her book The Sexual Contract that the social contract excluded persons of colour and women respectively .
His poor physical health made him short-tempered and even harsher in his writings and comments . His wife Katharina was overheard saying , " Dear husband , you are too rude , " and he responded , " They are teaching me to be rude . " In 1545 and 1546 Luther preached three times in the Market Church in Halle , staying with his friend Justus Jonas during Christmas .
Since the 16th century , the city has had a bear pit , the Bärengraben , at the far end of the Nydeggbrücke to house its heraldic animals . The currently four bears are now kept in an open-air enclosure nearby , and two other young bears , a present by the Russian president , are kept in Dählhölzli zoo .
Kenneth Gergen formulated additional classifications , which include the strategic manipulator , the pastiche personality , and the relational self . The strategic manipulator is a person who begins to regard all senses of identity merely as role-playing exercises , and who gradually becomes alienated from his or her social " self " . The pastiche personality abandons all aspirations toward a true or " essential " identity , instead viewing social interactions as opportunities to play out , and hence become , the roles they play . Finally , the relational self is a perspective by which persons abandon all sense of exclusive self , and view all sense of identity in terms of social engagement with others . For Gergen , these strategies follow one another in phases , and they are linked to the increase in popularity of postmodern culture and the rise of telecommunications technology .
The sessions of the City Parliament are public . Unlike members of the City Council , members of the City Parliament are not politicians by profession , and they are paid a fee based on their attendance . Any resident of Bern allowed to vote can be elected as a member of the City Parliament . The parliament holds its meetings in the Stadthaus ( Town Hall ) .
Although Egypt was a majority Christian country before the 7th Century , after Islam arrived , the country was slowly Islamified to become a majority Muslim country . Egypt emerged as a centre of politics and culture in the Muslim world . Under Anwar Sadat , Islam became the official state religion and Sharia the main source of law . It is estimated that 15 million Egyptians follow Native Sufi orders , with the Sufi leadership asserting that the numbers are much greater as many Egyptian Sufis are not officially registered with a Sufi order .
Monroe 's style involved playing lead melodies in the style of a fiddler , and also a percussive chording sound referred to as " the chop " for the sound made by the quickly struck and muted strings . He also perfected a sparse , percussive blues style , especially up the neck in keys that had not been used much in country music , notably B and E. He emphasized a powerful , syncopated right hand at the expense of left-hand virtuosity . Monroe 's most influential follower of the second generation is Frank Wakefield and nowadays Mike Compton of the Nashville Bluegrass Band and David Long , who often tour as a duet . Tiny Moore of the Texas Playboys developed an electric five-string mandolin and helped popularize the instrument in Western Swing music .
The plan stated that the following numbers of species of different groups had been recorded from Egypt : algae ( 1483 species ) , animals ( about 15,000 species of which more than 10,000 were insects ) , fungi ( more than 627 species ) , monera ( 319 species ) , plants ( 2426 species ) , protozoans ( 371 species ) . For some major groups , for example lichen-forming fungi and nematode worms , the number was not known . Apart from small and well-studied groups like amphibians , birds , fish , mammals and reptiles , the many of those numbers are likely to increase as further species are recorded from Egypt . For the fungi , including lichen-forming species , for example , subsequent work has shown that over 2200 species have been recorded from Egypt , and the final figure of all fungi actually occurring in the country is expected to be much higher .
A psychological identity relates to self-image ( one 's mental model of oneself ) , self-esteem , and individuality . Consequently , Weinreich gives the definition " A person 's identity is defined as the totality of one 's self-construal , in which how one construes oneself in the present expresses the continuity between how one construes oneself as one was in the past and how one construes oneself as one aspires to be in the future " ; this allows for definitions of aspects of identity , such as : " One 's ethnic identity is defined as that part of the totality of one 's self-construal made up of those dimensions that express the continuity between one 's construal of past ancestry and one 's future aspirations in relation to ethnicity " ( Weinreich , 1986a ) .
Luther objected to a saying attributed to Johann Tetzel that " As soon as the coin in the coffer rings , the soul from purgatory ( also attested as 'into heaven ' ) springs . "
In the summer of 1521 , Luther widened his target from individual pieties like indulgences and pilgrimages to doctrines at the heart of Church practices . In On the Abrogation of the Private Mass , he condemned as idolatry the idea that the mass is a sacrifice , asserting instead that it is a gift , to be received with thanksgiving by the whole congregation . His essay On Confession , Whether the Pope has the Power to Require It rejected compulsory confession and encouraged private confession and absolution , since " every Christian is a confessor . " In November , Luther wrote The Judgement of Martin Luther on Monastic Vows . He assured monks and nuns that they could break their vows without sin , because vows were an illegitimate and vain attempt to win salvation .
Peyton Manning became the first quarterback ever to lead two different teams to multiple Super Bowls . He is also the oldest quarterback ever to play in a Super Bowl at age 39 . The past record was held by John Elway , who led the Broncos to victory in Super Bowl XXXIII at age 38 and is currently Denver 's Executive Vice President of Football Operations and General Manager .
John Locke in particular exemplified this new age of political theory with his work Two Treatises of Government . In it Locke proposes a state of nature theory that directly complements his conception of how political development occurs and how it can be founded through contractual obligation . Locke stood to refute Sir Robert Filmer 's paternally founded political theory in favor of a natural system based on nature in a particular given system . The theory of the divine right of kings became a passing fancy , exposed to the type of ridicule with which John Locke treated it . Unlike Machiavelli and Hobbes but like Aquinas , Locke would accept Aristotle 's dictum that man seeks to be happy in a state of social harmony as a social animal . Unlike Aquinas 's preponderant view on the salvation of the soul from original sin , Locke believes man 's mind comes into this world as tabula rasa . For Locke , knowledge is neither innate , revealed nor based on authority but subject to uncertainty tempered by reason , tolerance and moderation . According to Locke , an absolute ruler as proposed by Hobbes is unnecessary , for natural law is based on reason and seeking peace and survival for man .
Bon Jovi 's third album , Slippery When Wet ( 1986 ) , mixed hard rock with a pop sensitivity and spent a total of 8 weeks at the top of the Billboard 200 album chart , selling 12 million copies in the US while becoming the first hard rock album to spawn three top 10 singles — two of which reached number one . The album has been credited with widening the audiences for the genre , particularly by appealing to women as well as the traditional male dominated audience , and opening the door to MTV and commercial success for other bands at the end of the decade . The anthemic The Final Countdown ( 1986 ) by Swedish group Europe was an international hit , reaching number eight on the US charts while hitting the top 10 in nine other countries . This era also saw more glam-infused American hard rock bands come to the forefront , with both Poison and Cinderella releasing their multi-platinum début albums in 1986 . Van Halen released 5150 ( 1986 ) , their first album with Sammy Hagar on lead vocals , which was number one in the US for three weeks and sold over 6 million copies . By the second half of the decade , hard rock had become the most reliable form of commercial popular music in the United States .

The Sky Q Silver set top box is capable of receiving and displaying UHD broadcasts , which Sky will introduce later in 2016 .
In 1501 , at the age of 19 , he entered the University of Erfurt , which he later described as a beerhouse and whorehouse . He was made to wake at four every morning for what has been described as " a day of rote learning and often wearying spiritual exercises . " He received his master 's degree in 1505 .
Noteworthy Irish mandolinists include Andy Irvine ( who , like Johnny Moynihan , almost always tunes the top E down to D , to achieve an open tuning of GDAD ) , Paul Brady , Mick Moloney , Paul Kelly and Claudine Langille . John Sheahan and the late Barney McKenna , respectively fiddle player and tenor banjo player with The Dubliners , are also accomplished Irish mandolin players . The instruments used are either flat-backed , oval hole examples as described above ( made by UK luthier Roger Bucknall of Fylde Guitars ) , or carved-top , oval hole instruments with arched back ( made by Stefan Sobell in Northumberland ) . The Irish guitarist Rory Gallagher often played the mandolin on stage , and he most famously used it in the song " Going To My Hometown . "
As of 2015 , Bern 's City Council is made up of two representatives of the SP ( Social Democratic Party , of whom one is also the mayor ) , and one each of CVP ( Christian Democratic Party ) , GB ( Green Alliance of Berne ) , and FDP ( FDP.The Liberals ) , giving the left parties a majority of three out of five seats . The last election was held on 25 November 2012 .
CBS set the base rate for a 30-second advertisement at $ 5,000,000 , a record high price for a Super Bowl ad . As of January 26 , the advertisements had not yet sold out . CBS mandated that all advertisers purchase a package covering time on both the television and digital broadcasts of the game , meaning that for the first time , digital streams of the game would carry all national advertising in pattern with the television broadcast . This would be the final year in a multi-year contract with Anheuser-Busch InBev that allowed the beer manufacturer to air multiple advertisements during the game at a steep discount . It was also the final year that Doritos , a longtime sponsor of the game , held its " Crash the Super Bowl " contest that allowed viewers to create their own Doritos ads for a chance to have it aired during the game . Nintendo and The Pokémon Company also made their Super Bowl debut , promoting the 20th anniversary of the Pokémon video game and media franchise .
The City Council ( Gemeinderat ) constitutes the executive government of the City of Bern and operates as a collegiate authority . It is composed of five councilors ( German : Gemeinderat/-rätin ) , each presiding over a directorate ( Direktion ) comprising several departments and bureaus . The president of the executive department acts as mayor ( Stadtpräsident ) . In the mandate period 2013–2016 ( Legislatur ) the City Council is presided by Stadtpräsident Alexander Tschäppät . Departmental tasks , coordination measures and implementation of laws decreed by the City Parliament are carried by the City Council . The regular election of the City Council by any inhabitant valid to vote is held every four years . Any resident of Bern allowed to vote can be elected as a member of the City Council . The delegates are selected by means of a system of Majorz . The mayor is elected as such as well by public election while the heads of the other directorates are assigned by the collegiate . The executive body holds its meetings in the Erlacherhof , built by architect Albrecht Stürler after 1747 .
In early 1991 , non-Arabs of the Zaghawa tribe of Sudan attested that they were victims of an intensifying Arab apartheid campaign , segregating Arabs and non-Arabs ( specifically people of sub-Saharan African descent ) . Sudanese Arabs , who controlled the government , were widely referred to as practicing apartheid against Sudan 's non-Arab citizens . The government was accused of " deftly manipulat ( ing ) Arab solidarity " to carry out policies of apartheid and ethnic cleansing .
Roughly one quarter of all zinc output in the United States ( 2009 ) , is consumed in the form of zinc compounds ; a variety of which are used industrially . Zinc oxide is widely used as a white pigment in paints , and as a catalyst in the manufacture of rubber . It is also used as a heat disperser for the rubber and acts to protect its polymers from ultraviolet radiation ( the same UV protection is conferred to plastics containing zinc oxide ) . The semiconductor properties of zinc oxide make it useful in varistors and photocopying products . The zinc zinc-oxide cycle is a two step thermochemical process based on zinc and zinc oxide for hydrogen production .
Possibly as early as the second century AD , Virgil 's works were seen as having magical properties and were used for divination . In what became known as the Sortes Vergilianae ( Virgilian Lots ) , passages would be selected at random and interpreted to answer questions . In the 12th century , starting around Naples but eventually spreading widely throughout Europe , a tradition developed in which Virgil was regarded as a great magician . Legends about Virgil and his magical powers remained popular for over two hundred years , arguably becoming as prominent as his writings themselves . Virgil 's legacy in medieval Wales was such that the Welsh version of his name , Fferyllt or Pheryllt , became a generic term for magic-worker , and survives in the modern Welsh word for pharmacist , fferyllydd .
In March 2010 , Sony Corp has partnered with The Michael Jackson Company with a contract of more than $ 250 million , the largest deal in recorded music history .
Medieval political philosophy in Europe was heavily influenced by Christian thinking . It had much in common with the Mutazalite Islamic thinking in that the Roman Catholics though subordinating philosophy to theology did not subject reason to revelation but in the case of contradictions , subordinated reason to faith as the Asharite of Islam . The Scholastics by combining the philosophy of Aristotle with the Christianity of St. Augustine emphasized the potential harmony inherent in reason and revelation . Perhaps the most influential political philosopher of medieval Europe was St. Thomas Aquinas who helped reintroduce Aristotle 's works , which had only been transmitted to Catholic Europe through Muslim Spain , along with the commentaries of Averroes . Aquinas 's use of them set the agenda , for scholastic political philosophy dominated European thought for centuries even unto the Renaissance .
Political and economic relations were drastically influenced by these theories as the concept of the guild was subordinated to the theory of free trade , and Roman Catholic dominance of theology was increasingly challenged by Protestant churches subordinate to each nation-state , which also ( in a fashion the Roman Catholic Church often decried angrily ) preached in the vulgar or native language of each region . However , the enlightenment was an outright attack on religion , particularly Christianity . The most outspoken critic of the church in France was François Marie Arouet de Voltaire , a representative figure of the enlightenment . After Voltaire , religion would never be the same again in France .
After a major blaze in 1405 , the city 's original wooden buildings were gradually replaced by half-timbered houses and subsequently the sandstone buildings which came to be characteristic for the Old Town . Despite the waves of pestilence that hit Europe in the 14th century , the city continued to grow : mainly due to immigration from the surrounding countryside .
There are many styles of mandolin , but four are common , the Neapolitan or round-backed mandolin , the carved-top mandolin and the flat-backed mandolin . The round-back has a deep bottom , constructed of strips of wood , glued together into a bowl . The carved-top or arch-top mandolin has a much shallower , arched back , and an arched top—both carved out of wood . The flat-backed mandolin uses thin sheets of wood for the body , braced on the inside for strength in a similar manner to a guitar . Each style of instrument has its own sound quality and is associated with particular forms of music . Neapolitan mandolins feature prominently in European classical music and traditional music . Carved-top instruments are common in American folk music and bluegrass music . Flat-backed instruments are commonly used in Irish , British and Brazilian folk music . Some modern Brazilian instruments feature an extra fifth course tuned a fifth lower than the standard fourth course .
On 15 June 1520 , the Pope warned Luther with the papal bull ( edict ) Exsurge Domine that he risked excommunication unless he recanted 41 sentences drawn from his writings , including the 95 Theses , within 60 days . That autumn , Johann Eck proclaimed the bull in Meissen and other towns . Karl von Miltitz , a papal nuncio , attempted to broker a solution , but Luther , who had sent the Pope a copy of On the Freedom of a Christian in October , publicly set fire to the bull and decretals at Wittenberg on 10 December 1520 , an act he defended in Why the Pope and his Recent Book are Burned and Assertions Concerning All Articles . As a consequence , Luther was excommunicated by Pope Leo X on 3 January 1521 , in the bull Decet Romanum Pontificem .
In the first 200 years that black people were in the United States , they primarily identified themselves by their specific ethnic group ( closely allied to language ) and not by skin color . Individuals identified themselves , for example , as Ashanti , Igbo , Bakongo , or Wolof . However , when the first captives were brought to the Americas , they were often combined with other groups from West Africa , and individual ethnic affiliations were not generally acknowledged by English colonists . In areas of the Upper South , different ethnic groups were brought together . This is significant as the captives came from a vast geographic region : the West African coastline stretching from Senegal to Angola and in some cases from the south-east coast such as Mozambique . A new African-American identity and culture was born that incorporated elements of the various ethnic groups and of European cultural heritage , resulting in fusions such as the Black church and Black English . This new identity was based on provenance and slave status rather than membership in any one ethnic group . [ citation needed ] By contrast , slave records from Louisiana show that the French and Spanish colonists recorded more complete identities of the West Africans , including ethnicities and given tribal names .
This was the first Super Bowl to feature a quarterback on both teams who was the # 1 pick in their draft classes . Manning was the # 1 selection of the 1998 NFL draft , while Newton was picked first in 2011 . The matchup also pits the top two picks of the 2011 draft against each other : Newton for Carolina and Von Miller for Denver . Manning and Newton also set the record for the largest age difference between opposing Super Bowl quarterbacks at 13 years and 48 days ( Manning was 39 , Newton was 26 ) .
Various gold-themed promotions and initiatives were held throughout the 2015 NFL season to tie into the " Golden Super Bowl " ; gold-tinted logos were implemented across the NFL 's properties and painted on fields , the numbering of the 50-yard line on fields was colored gold , and beginning on week 7 , all sideline jackets and hats featured gold-trimmed logos . Gold footballs were given to each high school that has had a player or coach appear in the Super Bowl , and " homecoming " events were also held by Super Bowl-winning teams at games .
He later attributed his decision to an event : on 2 July 1505 , he was returning to university on horseback after a trip home . During a thunderstorm , a lightning bolt struck near him . Later telling his father he was terrified of death and divine judgment , he cried out , " Help ! Saint Anna , I will become a monk ! " He came to view his cry for help as a vow he could never break . He left law school , sold his books , and entered a closed Augustinian cloister in Erfurt on 17 July 1505 . One friend blamed the decision on Luther 's sadness over the deaths of two friends . Luther himself seemed saddened by the move . Those who attended a farewell supper walked him to the door of the Black Cloister . " This day you see me , and then , not ever again , " he said . His father was furious over what he saw as a waste of Luther 's education .

To avoid confusing or upsetting the people , Luther avoided extreme change . He also did not wish to replace one controlling system with another . He concentrated on the church in the Electorate of Saxony , acting only as an adviser to churches in new territories , many of which followed his Saxon model . He worked closely with the new elector , John the Steadfast , to whom he turned for secular leadership and funds on behalf of a church largely shorn of its assets and income after the break with Rome . For Luther 's biographer Martin Brecht , this partnership " was the beginning of a questionable and originally unintended development towards a church government under the temporal sovereign " . The elector authorised a visitation of the church , a power formerly exercised by bishops . At times , Luther 's practical reforms fell short of his earlier radical pronouncements . For example , the Instructions for the Visitors of Parish Pastors in Electoral Saxony ( 1528 ) , drafted by Melanchthon with Luther 's approval , stressed the role of repentance in the forgiveness of sins , despite Luther 's position that faith alone ensures justification . The Eisleben reformer Johannes Agricola challenged this compromise , and Luther condemned him for teaching that faith is separate from works . The Instruction is a problematic document for those seeking a consistent evolution in Luther 's thought and practice .
As opposed to broadcasts of primetime series , CBS broadcast special episodes of its late night talk shows as its lead-out programs for Super Bowl 50 , beginning with a special episode of The Late Show with Stephen Colbert following the game . Following a break for late local programming , CBS also aired a special episode of The Late Late Show with James Corden .
In the late 1960s , the term heavy metal was used interchangeably with hard rock , but gradually began to be used to describe music played with even more volume and intensity . While hard rock maintained a bluesy rock and roll identity , including some swing in the back beat and riffs that tended to outline chord progressions in their hooks , heavy metal 's riffs often functioned as stand-alone melodies and had no swing in them . Heavy metal took on " darker " characteristics after Black Sabbath 's breakthrough at the beginning of the 1970s . In the 1980s it developed a number of subgenres , often termed extreme metal , some of which were influenced by hardcore punk , and which further differentiated the two styles . Despite this differentiation , hard rock and heavy metal have existed side by side , with bands frequently standing on the boundary of , or crossing between , the genres .
For fortification , however , a 2003 review recommended zinc oxide in cereals as cheap , stable , and as easily absorbed as more expensive forms . A 2005 study found that various compounds of zinc , including oxide and sulfate , did not show statistically significant differences in absorption when added as fortificants to maize tortillas . A 1987 study found that zinc picolinate was better absorbed than zinc gluconate or zinc citrate . However , a study published in 2008 determined that zinc glycinate is the best absorbed of the four dietary supplement types available .
Chanakya , 4th Century BC Indian political philosopher . The Arthashastra provides an account of the science of politics for a wise ruler , policies for foreign affairs and wars , the system of a spy state and surveillance and economic stability of the state . Chanakya quotes several authorities including Bruhaspati , Ushanas , Prachetasa Manu , Parasara , and Ambi , and described himself as a descendant of a lineage of political philosophers , with his father Chanaka being his immediate predecessor . Another influential extant Indian treatise on political philosophy is the Sukra Neeti . An example of a code of law in ancient India is the Manusmṛti or Laws of Manu .
The Panthers offense , which led the NFL in scoring ( 500 points ) , was loaded with talent , boasting six Pro Bowl selections . Pro Bowl quarterback Cam Newton had one of his best seasons , throwing for 3,837 yards and rushing for 636 , while recording a career-high and league-leading 45 total touchdowns ( 35 passing , 10 rushing ) , a career-low 10 interceptions , and a career-best quarterback rating of 99.4 . Newton 's leading receivers were tight end Greg Olsen , who caught a career-high 77 passes for 1,104 yards and seven touchdowns , and wide receiver Ted Ginn , Jr. , who caught 44 passes for 739 yards and 10 touchdowns ; Ginn also rushed for 60 yards and returned 27 punts for 277 yards . Other key receivers included veteran Jerricho Cotchery ( 39 receptions for 485 yards ) , rookie Devin Funchess ( 31 receptions for 473 yards and five touchdowns ) , and second-year receiver Corey Brown ( 31 receptions for 447 yards ) . The Panthers backfield featured Pro Bowl running back Jonathan Stewart , who led the team with 989 rushing yards and six touchdowns in 13 games , along with Pro Bowl fullback Mike Tolbert , who rushed for 256 yards and caught 18 passes for another 154 yards . Carolina 's offensive line also featured two Pro Bowl selections : center Ryan Kalil and guard Trai Turner .
Others have rejected that the doctrine of Immaculate Conception exists in Islam , the Quranic account does not confirm the Immaculate Conception exclusively for Mary as in Islam every human child is born pure and immaculate , her sinless birth is thus independent of the Christian docrtrine of original sin as no such doctrine exists in Islam . Moreover , Hannah 's prayer in the Quran for her child to remain protected from Satan ( Shayṭān ) was said after it had already been born , not before and expresses a natural concern any righteous parent would have . The Muslim tradition or hadith , which states that the only children born without the " touch of Satan , " were Mary and Jesus . should therefore not be taken in isolation from the Quran , and is to be interpreted within the specific context of exonerating Mary and her child from the charges that were made against them and is not a general statement . The specific mention of Mary and Jesus in this hadith may also be taken to represent a class of people , in keeping with the Arabic language and the Quranic verse [ O Satan ] surely thou shalt have no power over My servants , except such of the erring ones as choose to follow thee ( 15:42 )
On 18 January 2014 , the interim government successfully institutionalised a more secular constitution . The president is elected to a four-year term and may serve 2 terms . The parliament may impeach the president . Under the constitution , there is a guarantee of gender equality and absolute freedom of thought . The military retains the ability to appoint the national Minister of Defence for the next 8 years . Under the constitution , political parties may not be based on " religion , race , gender or geography " .
Book 1 ( at the head of the Odyssean section ) opens with a storm which Juno , Aeneas ' enemy throughout the poem , stirs up against the fleet . The storm drives the hero to the coast of Carthage , which historically was Rome 's deadliest foe . The queen , Dido , welcomes the ancestor of the Romans , and under the influence of the gods falls deeply in love with him . At a banquet in Book 2 , Aeneas tells the story of the sack of Troy , the death of his wife , and his escape , to the enthralled Carthaginians , while in Book 3 he recounts to them his wanderings over the Mediterranean in search of a suitable new home . Jupiter in Book 4 recalls the lingering Aeneas to his duty to found a new city , and he slips away from Carthage , leaving Dido to commit suicide , cursing Aeneas and calling down revenge in a symbolic anticipation of the fierce wars between Carthage and Rome . In Book 5 , Aeneas ' father Anchises dies and funeral games are celebrated for him . On reaching Cumae , in Italy in Book 6 , Aeneas consults the Cumaean Sibyl , who conducts him through the Underworld where Aeneas meets the dead Anchises who reveals Rome 's destiny to his son .

The Broncos defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers in the divisional round , 23–16 , by scoring 11 points in the final three minutes of the game . They then beat the defending Super Bowl XLIX champion New England Patriots in the AFC Championship Game , 20–18 , by intercepting a pass on New England 's 2-point conversion attempt with 17 seconds left on the clock . Despite Manning 's problems with interceptions during the season , he did n't throw any in their two playoff games .
Peyton Manning became the first quarterback ever to lead two different teams to multiple Super Bowls . He is also the oldest quarterback ever to play in a Super Bowl at age 39 . The past record was held by John Elway , who led the Broncos to victory in Super Bowl XXXIII at age 38 and is currently Denver 's Executive Vice President of Football Operations and General Manager .
The Suez Canal is an artificial sea-level waterway in Egypt considered the most important centre of the maritime transport in the Middle East , connecting the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea . Opened in November 1869 after 10 years of construction work , it allows ship transport between Europe and Asia without navigation around Africa . The northern terminus is Port Said and the southern terminus is Port Tawfiq at the city of Suez . Ismailia lies on its west bank , 3 km ( 1.9 mi ) from the half-way point .
Contemporary Eastern Orthodox Christians often object to the dogmatic declaration of her immaculate conception as an " over-elaboration " of the faith and because they see it as too closely connected with a particular interpretation of the doctrine of ancestral sin . All the same , the historical and authentic tradition of Mariology in Byzantium took its historical point of departure from Sophronios , Damascene , and their imitators . The most famous Eastern Orthodox theologian to imply Mary 's Immaculate Conception was St. Gregory Palamas . Though many passages from his works were long known to extol and attribute to Mary a Christlike holiness in her human nature , traditional objections to Palamas ' disposition toward the Immaculate Conception typically rely on a poor understanding of his doctrine of " the purification of Mary " at the Annunciation . Not only did he explicitly cite St. Gregory Nazianzen for his understanding of Jesus ' purification at His baptism and Mary 's at the Annunciation , but Theophanes of Nicaea , Joseph Bryennius , and Gennadios Scholarios all explicitly placed Mary 's Conception as the first moment of her all-immaculate participation in the divine energies to such a degree that she was always completely without spot and graced . In addition to Emperor Manuel II and Gennadius Scholarius , St. Mark of Ephesus also fervently defended Mary 's title as " prepurified " against the Dominican , Manuel Calecas , who was perhaps promoting thomistic Mariology that denied Mary 's all-holiness from the first moment of her existence .
Of the Christian minority in Egypt over 90 % belong to the native Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria , an Oriental Orthodox Christian Church . Other native Egyptian Christians are adherents of the Coptic Catholic Church , the Evangelical Church of Egypt and various other Protestant denominations . Non-native Christian communities are largely found in the urban regions of Cairo and Alexandria , such as the Syro-Lebanese , who belong to Greek Catholic , Greek Orthodox , and Maronite Catholic denominations .
The roots of hard rock can be traced back to the 1950s , particularly electric blues , which laid the foundations for key elements such as a rough declamatory vocal style , heavy guitar riffs , string-bending blues-scale guitar solos , strong beat , thick riff-laden texture , and posturing performances . Electric blues guitarists began experimenting with hard rock elements such as driving rhythms , distorted guitar solos and power chords in the 1950s , evident in the work of Memphis blues guitarists such as Joe Hill Louis , Willie Johnson , and particularly Pat Hare , who captured a " grittier , nastier , more ferocious electric guitar sound " on records such as James Cotton 's " Cotton Crop Blues " ( 1954 ) . Other antecedents include Link Wray 's instrumental " Rumble " in 1958 , and the surf rock instrumentals of Dick Dale , such as " Let 's Go Trippin ' " ( 1961 ) and " Misirlou " ( 1962 ) .
The permanent headquarters of the Arab League are located in Cairo and the body 's secretary general has traditionally been Egyptian . This position is currently held by former foreign minister Nabil el-Araby . The Arab League briefly moved from Egypt to Tunis in 1978 to protest the Egypt-Israel Peace Treaty , but it later returned to Cairo in 1989 . Gulf monarchies , including the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia , have pledged billions of dollars to help Egypt overcome its economic difficulties since the July 2013 coup .
From the late 19th century , the South used a colloquial term , the one-drop rule , to classify as black a person of any known African ancestry . This practice of hypodescent was not put into law until the early 20th century . Legally the definition varied from state to state . Racial definition was more flexible in the 18th and 19th centuries before the American Civil War . For instance , President Thomas Jefferson held persons who were legally white ( less than 25 % black ) according to Virginia law at the time , but , because they were born to slave mothers , they were born into slavery , according to the principle of partus sequitur ventrem , which Virginia adopted into law in 1662 .
The Panthers seemed primed to score on their opening drive of the second half when Newton completed a 45-yard pass to Ted Ginn Jr. on the Denver 35-yard line on their second offensive play . But the Broncos defense halted the drive on the 26-yard line , and it ended with no points when Graham Gano hit the uprights on a 44-yard field goal attempt . After the miss , Manning completed a pair of passes to Emmanuel Sanders for gains of 25 and 22 yards , setting up McManus ' 33-yard field goal that gave the Broncos a 16–7 lead . Carolina got off to another strong start after the kickoff , with Newton completing a 42-yard pass to Corey Brown . But once again they came up empty , this time as a result of a Newton pass that bounced off the hands of Ginn and was intercepted by safety T. J . Ward . Ward fumbled the ball during the return , but Trevathan recovered it to enable Denver to keep possession .
The United States provides Egypt with annual military assistance , which in 2015 amounted to US $ 1.3 billion . In 1989 , Egypt was designated as a major non-NATO ally of the United States . Nevertheless , ties between the two countries have partially soured since the July 2013 military coup that deposed Islamist president Mohamed Morsi , with the Obama administration condemning Egypt 's violent crackdown on the Muslim Brotherhood and its supporters , and cancelling future military exercises involving the two countries . There have been recent attempts , however , to normalise relations between the two , with both governments frequently calling for mutual support in the fight against regional and international terrorism .
The Neapolitan style has an almond-shaped body resembling a bowl , constructed from curved strips of wood . It usually has a bent sound table , canted in two planes with the design to take the tension of the 8 metal strings arranged in four courses . A hardwood fingerboard sits on top of or is flush with the sound table . Very old instruments may use wooden tuning pegs , while newer instruments tend to use geared metal tuners . The bridge is a movable length of hardwood . A pickguard is glued below the sound hole under the strings . European roundbacks commonly use a 13-inch scale instead of the 13.876 common on archtop Mandolins .
The city of Bern or Berne ( German : Bern , pronounced [ bɛrn ] ( listen ) ; French : Berne [ bɛʁn ] ; Italian : Berna [ ˈbɛrna ] ; Romansh : Berna [ ˈbɛrnɐ ] ( help·info ) ; Bernese German : Bärn [ b̥æːrn ] ) is the de facto capital of Switzerland , referred to by the Swiss as their ( e.g . in German ) Bundesstadt , or " federal city " . [ note 1 ] With a population of 140,634 ( November 2015 ) , Bern is the fifth most populous city in Switzerland . The Bern agglomeration , which includes 36 municipalities , had a population of 406,900 in 2014 . The metropolitan area had a population of 660,000 in 2000 . Bern is also the capital of the Canton of Bern , the second most populous of Switzerland 's cantons .
There is disagreement about the origin of the term , but general consensus that " cardinalis " from the word cardo ( meaning 'pivot ' or 'hinge ' ) was first used in late antiquity to designate a bishop or priest who was incorporated into a church for which he had not originally been ordained . In Rome the first persons to be called cardinals were the deacons of the seven regions of the city at the beginning of the 6th century , when the word began to mean “ principal , ” “ eminent , ” or " superior . " The name was also given to the senior priest in each of the " title " churches ( the parish churches ) of Rome and to the bishops of the seven sees surrounding the city . By the 8th century the Roman cardinals constituted a privileged class among the Roman clergy . They took part in the administration of the church of Rome and in the papal liturgy . By decree of a synod of 769 , only a cardinal was eligible to become pope . In 1059 , during the pontificate of Nicholas II , cardinals were given the right to elect the pope under the Papal Bull In nomine Domini . For a time this power was assigned exclusively to the cardinal bishops , but the Third Lateran Council in 1179 gave back the right to the whole body of cardinals . Cardinals were granted the privilege of wearing the red hat by Pope Innocent IV in 1244 .

BSkyB 's digital service was officially launched on 1 October 1998 under the name Sky Digital , although small-scale tests were carried out before then . At this time the use of the Sky Digital brand made an important distinction between the new service and Sky 's analogue services . Key selling points were the improvement in picture and sound quality , increased number of channels and an interactive service branded Open ... . now called Sky Active , BSkyB competed with the ONdigital ( later ITV Digital ) terrestrial offering and cable services . Within 30 days , over 100,000 digiboxes had been sold , which help bolstered BSkyB 's decision to give away free digiboxes and minidishes from May 1999 .
Erik Erikson ( 1902-1994 ) became one of the earliest psychologists to take an explicit interest in identity . The Eriksonian framework rests upon a distinction among the psychological sense of continuity , known as the ego identity ( sometimes identified simply as " the self " ) ; the personal idiosyncrasies that separate one person from the next , known as the personal identity ; and the collection of social roles that a person might play , known as either the social identity or the cultural identity . Erikson 's work , in the psychodynamic tradition , aimed to investigate the process of identity formation across a lifespan . Progressive strength in the ego identity , for example , can be charted in terms of a series of stages in which identity is formed in response to increasingly sophisticated challenges . The process of forming a viable sense of identity for the culture is conceptualized as an adolescent task , and those who do not manage a resynthesis of childhood identifications are seen as being in a state of 'identity diffusion ' whereas those who retain their initially given identities unquestioned have 'foreclosed ' identities ( Weinreich & Saunderson 2003 p7-8 ) . On some readings of Erikson , the development of a strong ego identity , along with the proper integration into a stable society and culture , lead to a stronger sense of identity in general . Accordingly , a deficiency in either of these factors may increase the chance of an identity crisis or confusion ( Cote & Levine 2002 , p. 22 ) .
After each team punted , Panthers quarterback Cam Newton appeared to complete a 24-yard pass Jerricho Cotchery , but the call was ruled an incompletion and upheld after a replay challenge . CBS analyst and retired referee Mike Carey stated he disagreed with the call and felt the review clearly showed the pass was complete . A few plays later , on 3rd-and-10 from the 15-yard line , linebacker Von Miller knocked the ball out of Newton 's hands while sacking him , and Malik Jackson recovered it in the end zone for a Broncos touchdown , giving the team a 10–0 lead . This was the first fumble return touchdown in a Super Bowl since Super Bowl XXVIII at the end of the 1993 season .
In August 2004 , Sony entered joint venture with equal partner Bertelsmann , by merging Sony Music and Bertelsmann Music Group , Germany , to establish Sony BMG Music Entertainment . However Sony continued to operate its Japanese music business independently from Sony BMG while BMG Japan was made part of the merger .
Emerging British acts included Free , who released their signature song " All Right Now " ( 1970 ) , which has received extensive radio airplay in both the UK and US . After the breakup of the band in 1973 , vocalist Paul Rodgers joined supergroup Bad Company , whose eponymous first album ( 1974 ) was an international hit . The mixture of hard rock and progressive rock , evident in the works of Deep Purple , was pursued more directly by bands like Uriah Heep and Argent . Scottish band Nazareth released their self-titled début album in 1971 , producing a blend of hard rock and pop that would culminate in their best selling , Hair of the Dog ( 1975 ) , which contained the proto-power ballad " Love Hurts " . Having enjoyed some national success in the early 1970s , Queen , after the release of Sheer Heart Attack ( 1974 ) and A Night at the Opera ( 1975 ) , gained international recognition with a sound that used layered vocals and guitars and mixed hard rock with heavy metal , progressive rock , and even opera . The latter featured the single " Bohemian Rhapsody " , which stayed at number one in the UK charts for nine weeks .
From the years 1500 to 1850 , an estimated 3.5 million captives were forcibly shipped from West/Central Africa to Brazil ; the territory received the highest number of slaves of any country in the Americas . Scholars estimate that more than half of the Brazilian population is at least in part descended from these individuals . Brazil has the largest population of Afro-descendants outside of Africa . In contrast to the US , during the slavery period and after , the Portuguese colonial government and later Brazilian government did not pass formal anti-miscegenation or segregation laws . As in other Latin countries , intermarriage was prevalent during the colonial period and continued afterward . In addition , people of mixed race ( pardo ) often tended to marry white , and their descendants became accepted as white . As a result , some of the European descended population also has West African or Amerindian blood . According to the last census of the 20th century , in which Brazilians could choose from five color/ethnic categories with which they identified , 54 % of individuals identified as white , 6.2 % identified as black , and 39.5 % identified as pardo ( brown ) — a broad multi-racial category , including tri-racial persons .
The Roman Missal and the Roman Rite Liturgy of the Hours naturally includes references to Mary 's immaculate conception in the feast of the Immaculate Conception . An example is the antiphon that begins : " Tota pulchra es , Maria , et macula originalis non est in te " ( You are all beautiful , Mary , and the original stain [ of sin ] is not in you . Your clothing is white as snow , and your face is like the sun . You are all beautiful , Mary , and the original stain [ of sin ] is not in you . You are the glory of Jerusalem , you are the joy of Israel , you give honour to our people . You are all beautiful , Mary . ) On the basis of the original Gregorian chant music , polyphonic settings have been composed by Anton Bruckner , Pablo Casals , Maurice Duruflé , Grzegorz Gerwazy Gorczycki , no : Ola Gjeilo , José Maurício Nunes Garcia , and Nikolaus Schapfl ,
Due to the patriarchal nature of Arab society , Arab men , including during the slave trade in North Africa , enslaved more black women than men . They used more black female slaves in domestic service and agriculture than males . The men interpreted the Qur'an to permit sexual relations between a male master and his female slave outside of marriage ( see Ma malakat aymanukum and sex ) , leading to many mixed-race children . When an enslaved woman became pregnant with her Arab master 's child , she was considered as umm walad or " mother of a child " , a status that granted her privileged rights . The child was given rights of inheritance to the father 's property , so mixed-race children could share in any wealth of the father . Because the society was patrilineal , the children took their fathers ' social status at birth and were born free .
A cardinal who is not a bishop is still entitled to wear and use the episcopal vestments and other pontificalia ( episcopal regalia : mitre , crozier , zucchetto , pectoral cross and ring ) . Even if not a bishop , any cardinal has both actual and honorary precedence over non-cardinal patriarchs , as well as the archbishops and bishops who are not cardinals , but he can not perform the functions reserved solely to bishops , such as ordination . The prominent priests who since 1962 were not ordained bishops on their elevation to the cardinalate were over the age of 80 or near to it , and so no cardinal who was not a bishop has participated in recent papal conclaves .
Due to the often political and cultural contours of blackness in the United States , the notion of blackness can also be extended to non-black people . Toni Morrison once described Bill Clinton as the first black President of the United States , because , as she put it , he displayed " almost every trope of blackness " . Christopher Hitchens was offended by the notion of Clinton as the first black president , noting , " Mr Clinton , according to Toni Morrison , the Nobel Prize-winning novelist , is our first black President , the first to come from the broken home , the alcoholic mother , the under-the-bridge shadows of our ranking systems . Thus , we may have lost the mystical power to divine diabolism , but we can still divine blackness by the following symptoms : broken homes , alcoholic mothers , under-the-bridge habits and ( presumable from the rest of [ Arthur ] Miller 's senescent musings ) the tendency to sexual predation and to shameless perjury about same . " Some black activists were also offended , claiming that Clinton used his knowledge of black culture to exploit black people for political gain as no other president had before , while not serving black interests . They cite the lack of action during the Rwandan Genocide and his welfare reform , which Larry Roberts said had led to the worst child poverty since the 1960s . Others cited that the number of black people in jail increased during his administration .
The theologians , including Zwingli , Melanchthon , Martin Bucer , and Johannes Oecolampadius , differed on the significance of the words spoken by Jesus at the Last Supper : " This is my body which is for you " and " This cup is the new covenant in my blood " ( 1 Corinthians 11:23–26 ) . Luther insisted on the Real Presence of the body and blood of Christ in the consecrated bread and wine , which he called the sacramental union , while his opponents believed God to be only spiritually or symbolically present . Zwingli , for example , denied Jesus ' ability to be in more than one place at a time but Luther stressed the omnipresence of his human nature . According to transcripts , the debate sometimes became confrontational . Citing Jesus ' words " The flesh profiteth nothing " ( John 6.63 ) , Zwingli said , " This passage breaks your neck " . " Do n't be too proud , " Luther retorted , " German necks do n't break that easily . This is Hesse , not Switzerland . " On his table Luther wrote the words " Hoc est corpus meum " ( " This is my body " ) in chalk , to continually indicate his firm stance .
Sony Music Entertainment Inc. ( sometimes known as Sony Music or by the initials , SME ) is an American music corporation managed and operated by Sony Corporation of America ( SCA ) , a subsidiary of Japanese conglomerate Sony Corporation . In 1929 , the enterprise was first founded as American Record Corporation ( ARC ) and , in 1938 , was renamed Columbia Recording Corporation , following ARC 's acquisition by CBS . In 1966 , the company was reorganized to become CBS Records . In 1987 , Sony Corporation of Japan bought the company , and in 1991 , renamed it SME . It is the world 's second largest recorded music company , after Universal Music Group .
Dante made Virgil his guide in Hell and the greater part of Purgatory in The Divine Comedy . Dante also mentions Virgil in De vulgari eloquentia , along with Ovid , Lucan and Statius , as one of the four regulati poetae ( ii , vi , 7 ) .
Also in late 1965 , the Date subsidiary label was revived . This label released the first string of hits for Peaches & Herb and scored a few minor hits from various other artists . Date 's biggest success was " Time of the Season " by the Zombies , peaking at # 2 in 1969 . The label was discontinued in 1970 .
Luther had been suffering from ill health for years , including Ménière 's disease , vertigo , fainting , tinnitus , and a cataract in one eye . From 1531 to 1546 , his health deteriorated further . The years of struggle with Rome , the antagonisms with and among his fellow reformers , and the scandal which ensued from the bigamy of the Philip of Hesse incident , in which Luther had played a leading role , all may have contributed . In 1536 , he began to suffer from kidney and bladder stones , and arthritis , and an ear infection ruptured an ear drum . In December 1544 , he began to feel the effects of angina .
There is confusion currently as to the name of the eldest Vinaccia luthier who first ran the shop . His name has been put forth as Gennaro Vinaccia ( active c. 1710 to c. 1788 ) and Nic . Vinaccia . His son Antonio Vinaccia was active c. 1734 to c. 1796 . An early extant example of a mandolin is one built by Antonio Vinaccia in 1759 , which resides at the University of Edinburgh . Another is by Giuseppe Vinaccia , built in 1893 , is also at the University of Edinburgh . The earliest extant mandolin was built in 1744 by Antonio 's son , Gaetano Vinaccia . It resides in the Conservatoire Royal de Musique in Brussels , Belgium .
By 1526 , Luther found himself increasingly occupied in organising a new church . His Biblical ideal of congregations ' choosing their own ministers had proved unworkable . According to Bainton : " Luther 's dilemma was that he wanted both a confessional church based on personal faith and experience and a territorial church including all in a given locality . If he were forced to choose , he would take his stand with the masses , and this was the direction in which he moved . " From 1525 to 1529 , he established a supervisory church body , laid down a new form of worship service , and wrote a clear summary of the new faith in the form of two catechisms . Luther 's thought is revolutionary to the extent that it is a theology of the cross , the negation of every affirmation : as long as the cross is at the center , the system building tendency of reason is held in check , and system building does not degenerate into System .
Luther next set about reversing or modifying the new church practices . By working alongside the authorities to restore public order , he signalled his reinvention as a conservative force within the Reformation . After banishing the Zwickau prophets , he now faced a battle against not only the established Church but also the radical reformers who threatened the new order by fomenting social unrest and violence .
The structure of Bern 's city centre is largely medieval and has been recognised by UNESCO as a Cultural World Heritage Site . Perhaps its most famous sight is the Zytglogge ( Bernese German for " Time Bell " ) , an elaborate medieval clock tower with moving puppets . It also has an impressive 15th century Gothic cathedral , the Münster , and a 15th-century town hall . Thanks to 6 kilometres ( 4 miles ) of arcades , the old town boasts one of the longest covered shopping promenades in Europe .
Although one of the main obstacles still facing the Egyptian economy is the limited trickle down of wealth to the average population , many Egyptians criticise their government for higher prices of basic goods while their standards of living or purchasing power remains relatively stagnant . Corruption is often cited by Egyptians as the main impediment to further economic growth . The government promised major reconstruction of the country 's infrastructure , using money paid for the newly acquired third mobile license ( $ 3 billion ) by Etisalat in 2006 . In the Corruption Perceptions Index 2013 , Egypt was ranked 114 out of 177 .
Zinc is a bluish-white , lustrous , diamagnetic metal , though most common commercial grades of the metal have a dull finish . It is somewhat less dense than iron and has a hexagonal crystal structure , with a distorted form of hexagonal close packing , in which each atom has six nearest neighbors ( at 265.9 pm ) in its own plane and six others at a greater distance of 290.6 pm . The metal is hard and brittle at most temperatures but becomes malleable between 100 and 150 °C . Above 210 °C , the metal becomes brittle again and can be pulverized by beating . Zinc is a fair conductor of electricity . For a metal , zinc has relatively low melting ( 419.5 °C ) and boiling points ( 907 °C ) . Its melting point is the lowest of all the transition metals aside from mercury and cadmium .
The Sydney Mandolins ( Artistic Director : Adrian Hooper ) have contributed greatly to the repertoire through commissioning over 200 works by Australian and International composers . Most of these works have been released on Compact Disks and can regularly be heard on radio stations on the ABC and MBS networks . One of their members , mandolin virtuoso Paul Hooper , has had a number of Concertos written for him by composers such as Eric Gross . He has performed and recorded these works with the Sydney Symphony Orchestra and the Tasmanian Symphony Orchestra . As well , Paul Hooper has had many solo works dedicated to him by Australian composers e.g. , Caroline Szeto , Ian Shanahan , Larry Sitsky and Michael Smetanin .
Luther 's final journey , to Mansfeld , was taken because of his concern for his siblings ' families continuing in their father Hans Luther 's copper mining trade . Their livelihood was threatened by Count Albrecht of Mansfeld bringing the industry under his own control . The controversy that ensued involved all four Mansfeld counts : Albrecht , Philip , John George , and Gerhard . Luther journeyed to Mansfeld twice in late 1545 to participate in the negotiations for a settlement , and a third visit was needed in early 1546 for their completion .
In accordance with his father 's wishes , Luther enrolled in law school at the same university that year but dropped out almost immediately , believing that law represented uncertainty . Luther sought assurances about life and was drawn to theology and philosophy , expressing particular interest in Aristotle , William of Ockham , and Gabriel Biel . He was deeply influenced by two tutors , Bartholomaeus Arnoldi von Usingen and Jodocus Trutfetter , who taught him to be suspicious of even the greatest thinkers and to test everything himself by experience . Philosophy proved to be unsatisfying , offering assurance about the use of reason but none about loving God , which to Luther was more important . Reason could not lead men to God , he felt , and he thereafter developed a love-hate relationship with Aristotle over the latter 's emphasis on reason . For Luther , reason could be used to question men and institutions , but not God . Human beings could learn about God only through divine revelation , he believed , and Scripture therefore became increasingly important to him .
Muhammad Ali Pasha evolved the military from one that convened under the tradition of the corvée to a great modernised army . He introduced conscription of the male peasantry in 19th century Egypt , and took a novel approach to create his great army , strengthening it with numbers and in skill . Education and training of the new soldiers was not an option ; the new concepts were furthermore enforced by isolation . The men were held in barracks to avoid distraction of their growth as a military unit to be reckoned with . The resentment for the military way of life eventually faded from the men and a new ideology took hold , one of nationalism and pride . It was with the help of this newly reborn martial unit that Muhammad Ali imposed his rule over Egypt .
Contributions from governments and the private sector to UNFPA in 2014 exceeded $ 1 billion . The amount includes $ 477 million to the organization ’ s core resources and $ 529 million earmarked for specific programs and initiatives .
Peyton Manning became the first quarterback ever to lead two different teams to multiple Super Bowls . He is also the oldest quarterback ever to play in a Super Bowl at age 39 . The past record was held by John Elway , who led the Broncos to victory in Super Bowl XXXIII at age 38 and is currently Denver 's Executive Vice President of Football Operations and General Manager .
The Panthers beat the Seattle Seahawks in the divisional round , running up a 31–0 halftime lead and then holding off a furious second half comeback attempt to win 31–24 , avenging their elimination from a year earlier . The Panthers then blew out the Arizona Cardinals in the NFC Championship Game , 49–15 , racking up 487 yards and forcing seven turnovers .
Chinese political philosophy dates back to the Spring and Autumn Period , specifically with Confucius in the 6th century BC . Chinese political philosophy was developed as a response to the social and political breakdown of the country characteristic of the Spring and Autumn Period and the Warring States period . The major philosophies during the period , Confucianism , Legalism , Mohism , Agrarianism and Taoism , each had a political aspect to their philosophical schools . Philosophers such as Confucius , Mencius , and Mozi , focused on political unity and political stability as the basis of their political philosophies . Confucianism advocated a hierarchical , meritocratic government based on empathy , loyalty , and interpersonal relationships . Legalism advocated a highly authoritarian government based on draconian punishments and laws . Mohism advocated a communal , decentralized government centered on frugality and ascetism . The Agrarians advocated a peasant utopian communalism and egalitarianism . Taoism advocated a proto-anarchism . Legalism was the dominant political philosophy of the Qin Dynasty , but was replaced by State Confucianism in the Han Dynasty . Prior to China 's adoption of communism , State Confucianism remained the dominant political philosophy of China up to the 20th century .
Nearly two billion people in the developing world are deficient in zinc . In children it causes an increase in infection and diarrhea , contributing to the death of about 800,000 children worldwide per year . The World Health Organization advocates zinc supplementation for severe malnutrition and diarrhea . Zinc supplements help prevent disease and reduce mortality , especially among children with low birth weight or stunted growth . However , zinc supplements should not be administered alone , because many in the developing world have several deficiencies , and zinc interacts with other micronutrients .
Phil Skinner played a key role in 20th century development of the mandolin movement in Australia , and was awarded an MBE in 1979 for services to music and the community . He was born Harry Skinner in Sydney in 1903 and started learning music at age 10 when his uncle tutored him on the banjo . Skinner began teaching part-time at age 18 , until the Great Depression forced him to begin teaching full-time and learn a broader range of instruments . Skinner founded the Sydney Mandolin Orchestra , the oldest surviving mandolin orchestra in Australia .
Egypt actively practices capital punishment . Egypt 's authorities do not release figures on death sentences and executions , despite repeated requests over the years by human rights organisations . The United Nations human rights office and various NGOs expressed " deep alarm " after an Egyptian Minya Criminal Court sentenced 529 people to death in a single hearing on 25 March 2014 . Sentenced supporters of former President Mohamed Morsi will be executed for their alleged role in violence following his ousting in July 2013 . The judgment was condemned as a violation of international law . By May 2014 , approximately 16,000 people ( and as high as more than 40,000 by one independent count ) , mostly Brotherhood members or supporters , have been imprisoned after the coup after the Muslim Brotherhood was labelled as terrorist organisation by the post-coup interim Egyptian government .
However , the formation of one 's identity occurs through one 's identifications with significant others ( primarily with parents and other individuals during one 's biographical experiences , and also with " groups " as they are perceived ) . These others may be benign - such that one aspires to their characteristics , values and beliefs ( a process of idealistic-identification ) , or malign - when one wishes to dissociate from their characteristics ( a process of defensive contra-identification ) ( Weinreich & Saunderson 2003 , Chapter 1 , pp 54–61 ) .
In 1516 , Johann Tetzel , a Dominican friar and papal commissioner for indulgences , was sent to Germany by the Roman Catholic Church to sell indulgences to raise money to rebuild St. Peter 's Basilica in Rome . Roman Catholic theology stated that faith alone , whether fiduciary or dogmatic , can not justify man ; justification rather depends only on such faith as is active in charity and good works ( fides caritate formata ) . The benefits of good works could be obtained by donating money to the church .
The mandolin 's popularity in the United States was spurred by the success of a group of touring young European musicians known as the Estudiantina Figaro , or in the United States , simply the " Spanish Students . " The group landed in the U.S. on January 2 , 1880 in New York City , and played in Boston and New York to wildly enthusiastic crowds . Ironically , this ensemble did not play mandolins but rather bandurrias , which are also small , double-strung instruments that resemble the mandolin . The success of the Figaro Spanish Students spawned other groups who imitated their musical style and costumes . An Italian musician , Carlo Curti , hastily started a musical ensemble after seeing the Figaro Spanish Students perform ; his group of Italian born Americans called themselves the " Original Spanish Students , " counting on the American public to not know the difference between the Spanish bandurrias and Italian mandolins . The imitators ' use of mandolins helped to generate enormous public interest in an instrument previously relatively unknown in the United States .
After Morsi was ousted by the military , the judiciary system aligned itself with the new government , actively suopporting the repression of Muslim Brotherhood members . This resulted in a sharp increase in mass death sentences that arose criticism from the US president Barack Obama and the General Secretary of the UN , Ban Ki Moon . In April 2013 , one judge of the Minya governatorate of Upper Egypt , sentenced 1,212 people to death . In December 2014 the judge Mohammed Nagi Shahata , notorious for his fierceness in passing on death sentences , condemened to the capital penalty 188 members of the Muslim Brotherhood , for assaulting a police station . Various Egyptian and international human rights organisations have already pointed out the lack of fair trials , that often last only a few minutes and do not take into consideration the procedural standards of fair trials .

His poor physical health made him short-tempered and even harsher in his writings and comments . His wife Katharina was overheard saying , " Dear husband , you are too rude , " and he responded , " They are teaching me to be rude . " In 1545 and 1546 Luther preached three times in the Market Church in Halle , staying with his friend Justus Jonas during Christmas .
Although the self is distinct from identity , the literature of self-psychology can offer some insight into how identity is maintained ( Cote & Levin 2002 , p. 24 ) . From the vantage point of self-psychology , there are two areas of interest : the processes by which a self is formed ( the " I " ) , and the actual content of the schemata which compose the self-concept ( the " Me " ) . In the latter field , theorists have shown interest in relating the self-concept to self-esteem , the differences between complex and simple ways of organizing self-knowledge , and the links between those organizing principles and the processing of information ( Cote & Levin 2002 ) .

According to UNFPA these elements promote the right of " reproductive health " , that is physical , mental , and social health in matters related to reproduction and the reproductive system .
A person may display either relative weakness or relative strength in terms of both exploration and commitments . When assigned categories , four possible permutations result : identity diffusion , identity foreclosure , identity moratorium , and identity achievement . Diffusion is when a person lacks both exploration in life and interest in committing even to those unchosen roles that he or she occupies . Foreclosure is when a person has not chosen extensively in the past , but seems willing to commit to some relevant values , goals , or roles in the future . Moratorium is when a person displays a kind of flightiness , ready to make choices but unable to commit to them . Finally , achievement is when a person makes identity choices and commits to them .
After the First World War , however , it became apparent that the number of mixed-race people was growing at a faster rate than the white population , and by 1930 fear of the " half-caste menace " undermining the White Australia ideal from within was being taken as a serious concern . Dr. Cecil Cook , the Northern Territory Protector of Natives , noted that :
There is disagreement about the origin of the term , but general consensus that " cardinalis " from the word cardo ( meaning 'pivot ' or 'hinge ' ) was first used in late antiquity to designate a bishop or priest who was incorporated into a church for which he had not originally been ordained . In Rome the first persons to be called cardinals were the deacons of the seven regions of the city at the beginning of the 6th century , when the word began to mean “ principal , ” “ eminent , ” or " superior . " The name was also given to the senior priest in each of the " title " churches ( the parish churches ) of Rome and to the bishops of the seven sees surrounding the city . By the 8th century the Roman cardinals constituted a privileged class among the Roman clergy . They took part in the administration of the church of Rome and in the papal liturgy . By decree of a synod of 769 , only a cardinal was eligible to become pope . In 1059 , during the pontificate of Nicholas II , cardinals were given the right to elect the pope under the Papal Bull In nomine Domini . For a time this power was assigned exclusively to the cardinal bishops , but the Third Lateran Council in 1179 gave back the right to the whole body of cardinals . Cardinals were granted the privilege of wearing the red hat by Pope Innocent IV in 1244 .
Luther 's other major works on the Jews were his 60,000-word treatise Von den Juden und Ihren Lügen ( On the Jews and Their Lies ) , and Vom Schem Hamphoras und vom Geschlecht Christi ( On the Holy Name and the Lineage of Christ ) , both published in 1543 , three years before his death . Luther argued that the Jews were no longer the chosen people but " the devil 's people " , and referred to them with violent , vile language . Citing Deuteronomy 13 , wherein Moses commands the killing of idolaters and the burning of their cities and property as an offering to God , Luther called for a " scharfe Barmherzigkeit " ( " sharp mercy " ) against the Jews " to see whether we might save at least a few from the glowing flames . " Luther advocated setting synagogues on fire , destroying Jewish prayerbooks , forbidding rabbis from preaching , seizing Jews ' property and money , and smashing up their homes , so that these " envenomed worms " would be forced into labour or expelled " for all time " . In Robert Michael 's view , Luther 's words " We are at fault in not slaying them " amounted to a sanction for murder . " God 's anger with them is so intense , " Luther concluded , " that gentle mercy will only tend to make them worse , while sharp mercy will reform them but little . Therefore , in any case , away with them ! "
Egyptian literature traces its beginnings to ancient Egypt and is some of the earliest known literature . Indeed , the Egyptians were the first culture to develop literature as we know it today , that is , the book . It is an important cultural element in the life of Egypt . Egyptian novelists and poets were among the first to experiment with modern styles of Arabic literature , and the forms they developed have been widely imitated throughout the Middle East . The first modern Egyptian novel Zaynab by Muhammad Husayn Haykal was published in 1913 in the Egyptian vernacular . Egyptian novelist Naguib Mahfouz was the first Arabic-language writer to win the Nobel Prize in Literature . Egyptian women writers include Nawal El Saadawi , well known for her feminist activism , and Alifa Rifaat who also writes about women and tradition .
The inclusiveness of Weinreich 's definition ( above ) directs attention to the totality of one 's identity at a given phase in time , and assists in elucidating component aspects of one 's total identity , such as one 's gender identity , ethnic identity , occupational identity and so on . The definition readily applies to the young child , to the adolescent , to the young adult , and to the older adult in various phases of the life cycle . Depending on whether one is a young child or an adult at the height of one 's powers , how one construes oneself as one was in the past will refer to very different salient experiential markers . Likewise , how one construes oneself as one aspires to be in the future will differ considerably according to one 's age and accumulated experiences . ( Weinreich & Saunderson , ( eds ) 2003 , pp 26–34 ) .
From 1510 to 1520 , Luther lectured on the Psalms , the books of Hebrews , Romans , and Galatians . As he studied these portions of the Bible , he came to view the use of terms such as penance and righteousness by the Catholic Church in new ways . He became convinced that the church was corrupt in its ways and had lost sight of what he saw as several of the central truths of Christianity . The most important for Luther was the doctrine of justification – God 's act of declaring a sinner righteous – by faith alone through God 's grace . He began to teach that salvation or redemption is a gift of God 's grace , attainable only through faith in Jesus as the Messiah . " This one and firm rock , which we call the doctrine of justification , " he wrote , " is the chief article of the whole Christian doctrine , which comprehends the understanding of all godliness . "
Though almost any variety of acoustic mandolin might be adequate for Irish traditional music , virtually all Irish players prefer flat-backed instruments with oval sound holes to the Italian-style bowl-back mandolins or the carved-top mandolins with f-holes favoured by bluegrass mandolinists . The former are often too soft-toned to hold their own in a session ( as well as having a tendency to not stay in place on the player 's lap ) , whilst the latter tend to sound harsh and overbearing to the traditional ear . The f-hole mandolin , however , does come into its own in a traditional session , where its brighter tone cuts through the sonic clutter of a pub . Greatly preferred for formal performance and recording are flat-topped " Irish-style " mandolins ( reminiscent of the WWI-era Martin Army-Navy mandolin ) and carved ( arch ) top mandolins with oval soundholes , such as the Gibson A-style of the 1920s .
On December 28 , 2015 , ESPN Deportes announced that they had reached an agreement with CBS and the NFL to be the exclusive Spanish-language broadcaster of the game , marking the third dedicated Spanish-language broadcast of the Super Bowl . Unlike NBC and Fox , CBS does not have a Spanish-language outlet of its own that could broadcast the game ( though per league policy , a separate Spanish play-by-play call was carried on CBS 's second audio program channel for over-the-air viewers ) . The game was called by ESPN Deportes ' Monday Night Football commentary crew of Alvaro Martin and Raul Allegre , and sideline reporter John Sutcliffe .

In 1978 Aboriginal writer Kevin Gilbert received the National Book Council award for his book Living Black : Blacks Talk to Kevin Gilbert , a collection of Aboriginal people 's stories , and in 1998 was awarded ( but refused to accept ) the Human Rights Award for Literature for Inside Black Australia , a poetry anthology and exhibition of Aboriginal photography . In contrast to previous definitions based solely on the degree of Aboriginal ancestry , in 1990 the Government changed the legal definition of Aboriginal to include any :
The Sustainable Development Goals are ambitious , and they will require enormous efforts across countries , continents , industries and disciplines - but they are achievable . UNFPA is working with governments , partners and other UN agencies to directly tackle many of these goals - in particular Goal 3 on health , Goal 4 on education and Goal 5 on gender equality - and contributes in a variety of ways to achieving many of the rest .
Indian political philosophy evolved in ancient times and demarcated a clear distinction between ( 1 ) nation and state ( 2 ) religion and state . The constitutions of Hindu states evolved over time and were based on political and legal treatises and prevalent social institutions . The institutions of state were broadly divided into governance , administration , defense , law and order . Mantranga , the principal governing body of these states , consisted of the King , Prime Minister , Commander in chief of army , Chief Priest of the King . The Prime Minister headed the committee of ministers along with head of executive ( Maha Amatya ) .
In July 2012 , Ancestry.com reported on historic and DNA research by its staff that discovered that Obama is likely a descendant through his mother of John Punch , considered by some historians to be the first African slave in the Virginia colony . An indentured servant , he was " bound for life " in 1640 after trying to escape . The story of him and his descendants is that of multi-racial America since it appeared he and his sons married or had unions with white women , likely indentured servants and working-class like them . Their multi-racial children were free because they were born to free English women . Over time , Obama 's line of the Bunch family ( as they became known ) were property owners and continued to " marry white " ; they became part of white society , likely by the early to mid-18th century .
Egyptian literature traces its beginnings to ancient Egypt and is some of the earliest known literature . Indeed , the Egyptians were the first culture to develop literature as we know it today , that is , the book . It is an important cultural element in the life of Egypt . Egyptian novelists and poets were among the first to experiment with modern styles of Arabic literature , and the forms they developed have been widely imitated throughout the Middle East . The first modern Egyptian novel Zaynab by Muhammad Husayn Haykal was published in 1913 in the Egyptian vernacular . Egyptian novelist Naguib Mahfouz was the first Arabic-language writer to win the Nobel Prize in Literature . Egyptian women writers include Nawal El Saadawi , well known for her feminist activism , and Alifa Rifaat who also writes about women and tradition .
The game 's media day , which was typically held on the Tuesday afternoon prior to the game , was moved to the Monday evening and re-branded as Super Bowl Opening Night . The event was held on February 1 , 2016 at SAP Center in San Jose .

It is admitted that the doctrine as defined by Pius IX was not explicitly mooted before the 12th century . It is also agreed that " no direct or categorical and stringent proof of the dogma can be brought forward from Scripture " . But it is claimed that the doctrine is implicitly contained in the teaching of the Fathers . Their expressions on the subject of the sinlessness of Mary are , it is pointed out , so ample and so absolute that they must be taken to include original sin as well as actual . Thus in the first five centuries such epithets as " in every respect holy " , " in all things unstained " , " super-innocent " , and " singularly holy " are applied to her ; she is compared to Eve before the fall , as ancestress of a redeemed people ; she is " the earth before it was accursed " . The well-known words of St. Augustine ( d. 430 ) may be cited : " As regards the mother of God , " he says , " I will not allow any question whatever of sin . " It is true that he is here speaking directly of actual or personal sin . But his argument is that all men are sinners ; that they are so through original depravity ; that this original depravity may be overcome by the grace of God , and he adds that he does not know but that Mary may have had sufficient grace to overcome sin " of every sort " ( omni ex parte ) .
On July 1 , 2009 , SME and IODA announced their global strategic partnership to leverage combined worldwide online retail distribution networks and complementary technologies to support independent labels and music rightsholders .
64Zn , the most abundant isotope of zinc , is very susceptible to neutron activation , being transmuted into the highly radioactive 65Zn , which has a half-life of 244 days and produces intense gamma radiation . Because of this , Zinc Oxide used in nuclear reactors as an anti-corrosion agent is depleted of 64Zn before use , this is called depleted zinc oxide . For the same reason , zinc has been proposed as a salting material for nuclear weapons ( cobalt is another , better-known salting material ) . A jacket of isotopically enriched 64Zn would be irradiated by the intense high-energy neutron flux from an exploding thermonuclear weapon , forming a large amount of 65Zn significantly increasing the radioactivity of the weapon 's fallout . Such a weapon is not known to have ever been built , tested , or used . 65Zn is also used as a tracer to study how alloys that contain zinc wear out , or the path and the role of zinc in organisms .
BSkyB launched its HDTV service , Sky+ HD , on 22 May 2006 . Prior to its launch , BSkyB claimed that 40,000 people had registered to receive the HD service .

This was the first Super Bowl to feature a quarterback on both teams who was the # 1 pick in their draft classes . Manning was the # 1 selection of the 1998 NFL draft , while Newton was picked first in 2011 . The matchup also pits the top two picks of the 2011 draft against each other : Newton for Carolina and Von Miller for Denver . Manning and Newton also set the record for the largest age difference between opposing Super Bowl quarterbacks at 13 years and 48 days ( Manning was 39 , Newton was 26 ) .
Ethnic Egyptians are by far the largest ethnic group in the country , constituting 91 % of the total population . Ethnic minorities include the Abazas , Turks , Greeks , Bedouin Arab tribes living in the eastern deserts and the Sinai Peninsula , the Berber-speaking Siwis ( Amazigh ) of the Siwa Oasis , and the Nubian communities clustered along the Nile . There are also tribal Beja communities concentrated in the south-eastern-most corner of the country , and a number of Dom clans mostly in the Nile Delta and Faiyum who are progressively becoming assimilated as urbanisation increases .
In the 1980s , 1990s , and 2000s , terrorist attacks in Egypt became numerous and severe , and began to target Christian Copts , foreign tourists and government officials . In the 1990s an Islamist group , Al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya , engaged in an extended campaign of violence , from the murders and attempted murders of prominent writers and intellectuals , to the repeated targeting of tourists and foreigners . Serious damage was done to the largest sector of Egypt 's economy—tourism—and in turn to the government , but it also devastated the livelihoods of many of the people on whom the group depended for support .
Afro-Spaniards are Spanish nationals of West/Central African descent . They today mainly come from Angola , Brazil , Cameroon , Cape Verde , Equatorial Guinea , Ghana , Gambia , Guinea-Bissau , Mali , Nigeria and Senegal . Additionally , many Afro-Spaniards born in Spain are from the former Spanish colony Equatorial Guinea . Today , there are an estimated 683,000 Afro-Spaniards in Spain .

William Champion 's brother , John , patented a process in 1758 for calcining zinc sulfide into an oxide usable in the retort process . Prior to this , only calamine could be used to produce zinc . In 1798 , Johann Christian Ruberg improved on the smelting process by building the first horizontal retort smelter . Jean-Jacques Daniel Dony built a different kind of horizontal zinc smelter in Belgium , which processed even more zinc . Italian doctor Luigi Galvani discovered in 1780 that connecting the spinal cord of a freshly dissected frog to an iron rail attached by a brass hook caused the frog 's leg to twitch . He incorrectly thought he had discovered an ability of nerves and muscles to create electricity and called the effect " animal electricity " . The galvanic cell and the process of galvanization were both named for Luigi Galvani and these discoveries paved the way for electrical batteries , galvanization and cathodic protection .
Bon Jovi 's third album , Slippery When Wet ( 1986 ) , mixed hard rock with a pop sensitivity and spent a total of 8 weeks at the top of the Billboard 200 album chart , selling 12 million copies in the US while becoming the first hard rock album to spawn three top 10 singles — two of which reached number one . The album has been credited with widening the audiences for the genre , particularly by appealing to women as well as the traditional male dominated audience , and opening the door to MTV and commercial success for other bands at the end of the decade . The anthemic The Final Countdown ( 1986 ) by Swedish group Europe was an international hit , reaching number eight on the US charts while hitting the top 10 in nine other countries . This era also saw more glam-infused American hard rock bands come to the forefront , with both Poison and Cinderella releasing their multi-platinum début albums in 1986 . Van Halen released 5150 ( 1986 ) , their first album with Sammy Hagar on lead vocals , which was number one in the US for three weeks and sold over 6 million copies . By the second half of the decade , hard rock had become the most reliable form of commercial popular music in the United States .
But Amnesty International found no evidence that UNFPA had supported the coercion . A 2001 study conducted by the pro-life Population Research Institute ( PRI ) falsely claimed that the UNFPA shared an office with the Chinese family planning officials who were carrying out forced abortions . " We located the family planning offices , and in that family planning office , we located the UNFPA office , and we confirmed from family planning officials there that there is no distinction between what the UNFPA does and what the Chinese Family Planning Office does , " said Scott Weinberg , a spokesman for PRI . However , United Nations Members disagreed and approved UNFPA ’ s new country program me in January 2006 . The more than 130 members of the “ Group of 77 ” developing countries in the United Nations expressed support for the UNFPA programmes . In addition , speaking for European democracies -- Norway , Denmark , Sweden , Finland , the Netherlands , France , Belgium , Switzerland and Germany -- the United Kingdom stated , ” UNFPA ’ s activities in China , as in the rest of the world , are in strict conformity with the unanimously adopted Programme of Action of the ICPD , and play a key role in supporting our common endeavor , the promotion and protection of all human rights and fundamental freedoms . ”

Carolina suffered a major setback when Thomas Davis , an 11-year veteran who had already overcome three ACL tears in his career , went down with a broken arm in the NFC Championship Game . Despite this , he insisted he would still find a way to play in the Super Bowl . His prediction turned out to be accurate .
With 4:51 left in regulation , Carolina got the ball on their own 24-yard line with a chance to mount a game-winning drive , and soon faced 3rd-and-9 . On the next play , Miller stripped the ball away from Newton , and after several players dove for it , it took a long bounce backwards and was recovered by Ward , who returned it five yards to the Panthers 4-yard line . Although several players dove into the pile to attempt to recover it , Newton did not and his lack of aggression later earned him heavy criticism . Meanwhile , Denver 's offense was kept out of the end zone for three plays , but a holding penalty on cornerback Josh Norman gave the Broncos a new set of downs . Then Anderson scored on a 2-yard touchdown run and Manning completed a pass to Bennie Fowler for a 2-point conversion , giving Denver a 24–10 lead with 3:08 left and essentially putting the game away . Carolina had two more drives , but failed to get a first down on each one .

Gold footballs were given to each high school that has had a player or coach appear in the Super Bowl , and " homecoming " events were also held by Super Bowl-winning teams at games .
Nearly two billion people in the developing world are deficient in zinc . In children it causes an increase in infection and diarrhea , contributing to the death of about 800,000 children worldwide per year . The World Health Organization advocates zinc supplementation for severe malnutrition and diarrhea . Zinc supplements help prevent disease and reduce mortality , especially among children with low birth weight or stunted growth . However , zinc supplements should not be administered alone , because many in the developing world have several deficiencies , and zinc interacts with other micronutrients .
The popularity of this particular representation of The Immaculate Conception spread across the rest of Europe , and has since remained the best known artistic depiction of the concept : in a heavenly realm , moments after her creation , the spirit of Mary ( in the form of a young woman ) looks up in awe at ( or bows her head to ) God . The moon is under her feet and a halo of twelve stars surround her head , possibly a reference to " a woman clothed with the sun " from Revelation 12:1-2 . Additional imagery may include clouds , a golden light , and cherubs . In some paintings the cherubim are holding lilies and roses , flowers often associated with Mary .
On 17 December 1941 , seven Protestant regional church confederations issued a statement agreeing with the policy of forcing Jews to wear the yellow badge , " since after his bitter experience Luther had already suggested preventive measures against the Jews and their expulsion from German territory . " According to Daniel Goldhagen , Bishop Martin Sasse , a leading Protestant churchman , published a compendium of Luther 's writings shortly after Kristallnacht , for which Diarmaid MacCulloch , Professor of the History of the Church in the University of Oxford argued that Luther 's writing was a " blueprint . " Sasse applauded the burning of the synagogues and the coincidence of the day , writing in the introduction , " On 10 November 1938 , on Luther 's birthday , the synagogues are burning in Germany . " The German people , he urged , ought to heed these words " of the greatest antisemite of his time , the warner of his people against the Jews . "
To fill this gap in the literature , mandolin orchestras have traditionally played many arrangements of music written for regular orchestras or other ensembles . Some players have sought out contemporary composers to solicit new works . Traditional mandolin orchestras remain especially popular in Japan and Germany , but also exist throughout the United States , Europe and the rest of the world . They perform works composed for mandolin family instruments , or re-orchestrations of traditional pieces . The structure of a contemporary traditional mandolin orchestra consists of : first and second mandolins , mandolas ( either octave mandolas , tuned an octave below the mandolin , or tenor mandolas , tuned like the viola ) , mandocellos ( tuned like the cello ) , and bass instruments ( conventional string bass or , rarely , mandobasses ) . Smaller ensembles , such as quartets composed of two mandolins , mandola , and mandocello , may also be found .
The catechism is one of Luther 's most personal works . " Regarding the plan to collect my writings in volumes , " he wrote , " I am quite cool and not at all eager about it because , roused by a Saturnian hunger , I would rather see them all devoured . For I acknowledge none of them to be really a book of mine , except perhaps the Bondage of the Will and the Catechism . " The Small Catechism has earned a reputation as a model of clear religious teaching . It remains in use today , along with Luther 's hymns and his translation of the Bible .
In the 18th century , the Moroccan Sultan Moulay Ismail " the Bloodthirsty " ( 1672–1727 ) raised a corps of 150,000 black slaves , called his Black Guard , who coerced the country into submission .
Published at a time of rising demand for German-language publications , Luther 's version quickly became a popular and influential Bible translation . As such , it made a significant contribution to the evolution of the German language and literature . Furnished with notes and prefaces by Luther , and with woodcuts by Lucas Cranach that contained anti-papal imagery , it played a major role in the spread of Luther 's doctrine throughout Germany . The Luther Bible influenced other vernacular translations , such as William Tyndale 's English Bible ( 1525 forward ) , a precursor of the King James Bible .
Formed in November 1990 by the equal merger of Sky Television and British Satellite Broadcasting , BSkyB became the UK 's largest digital subscription television company . Following BSkyB 's 2014 acquisition of Sky Italia and a majority 90.04 % interest in Sky Deutschland in November 2014 , its holding company British Sky Broadcasting Group plc changed its name to Sky plc . The United Kingdom operations also changed the company name from British Sky Broadcasting Limited to Sky UK Limited , still trading as Sky .
The Panthers used the San Jose State practice facility and stayed at the San Jose Marriott . The Broncos practiced at Stanford University and stayed at the Santa Clara Marriott .
According to Dr. Carlos Moore , resident scholar at Brazil 's University of the State of Bahia , in the 21st century Afro-multiracials in the Arab world , including Arabs in North Africa , self-identify in ways that resemble multi-racials in Latin America . He claims that black-looking Arabs , much like black-looking Latin Americans , consider themselves white because they have some distant white ancestry .
The city of Bern or Berne ( German : Bern , pronounced [ bɛrn ] ( listen ) ; French : Berne [ bɛʁn ] ; Italian : Berna [ ˈbɛrna ] ; Romansh : Berna [ ˈbɛrnɐ ] ( help·info ) ; Bernese German : Bärn [ b̥æːrn ] ) is the de facto capital of Switzerland , referred to by the Swiss as their ( e.g . in German ) Bundesstadt , or " federal city " .

On November 17 , 1987 , SCA acquired CBS Records , which hosted such acts as Michael Jackson , for US $ 2 billion . CBS Inc. , now CBS Corporation , retained the rights to the CBS name for music recordings but granted Sony a temporary license to use the CBS name . CBS Corporation founded a new CBS Records in 2006 , which is distributed by Sony through its RED subsidiary .
In the Colonial America of 1619 , John Rolfe used negars in describing the slaves who were captured from West Africa and then shipped to the Virginia colony . Later American English spellings , neger and neggar , prevailed in a northern colony , New York under the Dutch , and in metropolitan Philadelphia 's Moravian and Pennsylvania Dutch communities ; the African Burial Ground in New York City originally was known by the Dutch name " Begraafplaats van de Neger " ( Cemetery of the Negro ) ; an early US occurrence of neger in Rhode Island , dates from 1625 . Thomas Jefferson also used the term " black " in his Notes on the State of Virginia in allusion to the slave populations .

The name of the metal was probably first documented by Paracelsus , a Swiss-born German alchemist , who referred to the metal as " zincum " or " zinken " in his book Liber Mineralium II , in the 16th century . The word is probably derived from the German zinke , and supposedly meant " tooth-like , pointed or jagged " ( metallic zinc crystals have a needle-like appearance ) . Zink could also imply " tin-like " because of its relation to German zinn meaning tin . Yet another possibility is that the word is derived from the Persian word سنگ seng meaning stone . The metal was also called Indian tin , tutanego , calamine , and spinter .
Egypt 's economy depends mainly on agriculture , media , petroleum imports , natural gas , and tourism ; there are also more than three million Egyptians working abroad , mainly in Saudi Arabia , the Persian Gulf and Europe . The completion of the Aswan High Dam in 1970 and the resultant Lake Nasser have altered the time-honored place of the Nile River in the agriculture and ecology of Egypt . A rapidly growing population , limited arable land , and dependence on the Nile all continue to overtax resources and stress the economy .
The Panthers offense , which led the NFL in scoring ( 500 points ) , was loaded with talent , boasting six Pro Bowl selections . Pro Bowl quarterback Cam Newton had one of his best seasons , throwing for 3,837 yards and rushing for 636 , while recording a career-high and league-leading 45 total touchdowns ( 35 passing , 10 rushing ) , a career-low 10 interceptions , and a career-best quarterback rating of 99.4 .

In 525 BC , the powerful Achaemenid Persians , led by Cambyses II , began their conquest of Egypt , eventually capturing the pharaoh Psamtik III at the battle of Pelusium . Cambyses II then assumed the formal title of pharaoh , but ruled Egypt from his home of Susa in Persia ( modern Iran ) , leaving Egypt under the control of a satrapy . The entire Twenty-seventh Dynasty of Egypt , from 525 BC to 402 BC , save for Petubastis III , was an entirely Persian ruled period , with the Achaemenid kings all being granted the title of pharaoh . A few temporarily successful revolts against the Persians marked the fifth century BC , but Egypt was never able to permanently overthrow the Persians .
After each team punted , Panthers quarterback Cam Newton appeared to complete a 24-yard pass Jerricho Cotchery , but the call was ruled an incompletion and upheld after a replay challenge . CBS analyst and retired referee Mike Carey stated he disagreed with the call and felt the review clearly showed the pass was complete . A few plays later , on 3rd-and-10 from the 15-yard line , linebacker Von Miller knocked the ball out of Newton 's hands while sacking him , and Malik Jackson recovered it in the end zone for a Broncos touchdown , giving the team a 10–0 lead . This was the first fumble return touchdown in a Super Bowl since Super Bowl XXVIII at the end of the 1993 season .

Beside the introduction of the lute to Spain ( Andalusia ) by the Moors , another important point of transfer of the lute from Arabian to European culture was Sicily , where it was brought either by Byzantine or later by Muslim musicians . There were singer-lutenists at the court in Palermo following the Norman conquest of the island from the Muslims , and the lute is depicted extensively in the ceiling paintings in the Palermo ’ s royal Cappella Palatina , dedicated by the Norman King Roger II of Sicily in 1140 . His Hohenstaufen grandson Frederick II , Holy Roman Emperor ( 1194 - 1250 ) continued integrating Muslims into his court , including Moorish musicians . By the 14th century , lutes had disseminated throughout Italy and , probably because of the cultural influence of the Hohenstaufen kings and emperor , based in Palermo , the lute had also made significant inroads into the German-speaking lands .
BSkyB 's digital service was officially launched on 1 October 1998 under the name Sky Digital , although small-scale tests were carried out before then . At this time the use of the Sky Digital brand made an important distinction between the new service and Sky 's analogue services . Key selling points were the improvement in picture and sound quality , increased number of channels and an interactive service branded Open ... . now called Sky Active , BSkyB competed with the ONdigital ( later ITV Digital ) terrestrial offering and cable services . Within 30 days , over 100,000 digiboxes had been sold , which help bolstered BSkyB 's decision to give away free digiboxes and minidishes from May 1999 .
The annual NFL Experience was held at the Moscone Center in San Francisco . In addition , " Super Bowl City " opened on January 30 at Justin Herman Plaza on The Embarcadero , featuring games and activities that will highlight the Bay Area 's technology , culinary creations , and cultural diversity . More than 1 million people are expected to attend the festivities in San Francisco during Super Bowl Week . San Francisco mayor Ed Lee said of the highly visible homeless presence in this area " they are going to have to leave " . San Francisco city supervisor Jane Kim unsuccessfully lobbied for the NFL to reimburse San Francisco for city services in the amount of $ 5 million .
There are eleven Renaissance allegorical statues on public fountains in the Old Town . Nearly all the 16th century fountains , except the Zähringer fountain which was created by Hans Hiltbrand , are the work of the Fribourg master Hans Gieng . One of the more interesting fountains is the Kindlifresserbrunnen ( Bernese German : Child Eater Fountain but often translated Ogre Fountain ) which is claimed to represent a Jew , the Greek god Chronos or a Fastnacht figure that scares disobedient children .
In addition , there are $ 2 million worth of other ancillary events , including a week-long event at the Santa Clara Convention Center , a beer , wine and food festival at Bellomy Field at Santa Clara University , and a pep rally . A professional fundraiser will aid in finding business sponsors and individual donors , but still may need the city council to help fund the event . Additional funding will be provided by the city council , which has announced plans to set aside seed funding for the event .
The " Neo-Eriksonian " identity status paradigm emerged in later years [ when ? ] , driven largely by the work of James Marcia . This paradigm focuses upon the twin concepts of exploration and commitment . The central idea is that any individual 's sense of identity is determined in large part by the explorations and commitments that he or she makes regarding certain personal and social traits . It follows that the core of the research in this paradigm investigates the degrees to which a person has made certain explorations , and the degree to which he or she displays a commitment to those explorations .
In accordance with tradition , they sign by placing the title " Cardinal " ( abbreviated Card . ) after their personal name and before their surname as , for instance , " John Card ( inal ) Doe " or , in Latin , " Ioannes Card ( inalis ) Cognomen " . Some writers , such as James-Charles Noonan , hold that , in the case of cardinals , the form used for signatures should be used also when referring to them in English . Official sources such as the Archdiocese of Milwaukee and Catholic News Service say that the correct form for referring to a cardinal in English is normally as " Cardinal [ First name ] [ Surname ] " . This is the rule given also in stylebooks not associated with the Catholic Church . This style is also generally followed on the websites of the Holy See and episcopal conferences . Oriental Patriarchs who are created Cardinals customarily use " Sanctae Ecclesiae Cardinalis " as their full title , probably because they do not belong to the Roman clergy .
It was not until January 1518 that friends of Luther translated the 95 Theses from Latin into German and printed and widely copied them , making the controversy one of the first in history to be aided by the printing press . Within two weeks , copies of the theses had spread throughout Germany ; within two months , they had spread throughout Europe .
Historians estimate that between the advent of Islam in 650CE and the abolition of slavery in the Arabian Peninsula in the mid-20th century , 10 to 18 million sub-Saharan Black Africans were enslaved by Arab slave traders and transported to the Arabian Peninsula and neighboring countries . This number far exceeded the number of slaves who were taken to the Americas . Several factors affected the visibility of descendants of this diaspora in 21st-century Arab societies : The traders shipped more female slaves than males , as there was a demand for them to serve as concubines in harems in the Arabian Peninsula and neighboring countries . Male slaves were castrated in order to serve as harem guards . The death toll of Black African slaves from forced labor was high . The mixed-race children of female slaves and Arab owners were assimilated into the Arab owners ' families under the patrilineal kinship system . As a result , few distinctive Afro-Arab black communities have survived in the Arabian Peninsula and neighboring countries .
After the First World War , however , it became apparent that the number of mixed-race people was growing at a faster rate than the white population , and by 1930 fear of the " half-caste menace " undermining the White Australia ideal from within was being taken as a serious concern . Dr. Cecil Cook , the Northern Territory Protector of Natives , noted that :
Some scholars have asserted that Luther taught that faith and reason were antithetical in the sense that questions of faith could not be illuminated by reason . He wrote , " All the articles of our Christian faith , which God has revealed to us in His Word , are in presence of reason sheerly impossible , absurd , and false . " and " [ That ] Reason in no way contributes to faith . [ ... ] For reason is the greatest enemy that faith has ; it never comes to the aid of spiritual things . " However , though seemingly contradictorily , he also wrote in the latter work that human reason " strives not against faith , when enlightened , but rather furthers and advances it " , bringing claims he was a fideist into dispute . Contemporary Lutheran scholarship , however , has found a different reality in Luther . Luther rather seeks to separate faith and reason in order to honor the separate spheres of knowledge that each applies to . Bernhard Lohse , for example , has demonstrated in his classic work " Fides und Ratio " that Luther ultimately sought to put the two together . More recently , Hans-Peter Grosshans has demonstrated that Luther 's work on Biblical Criticism stresses the need for external coherence in the right exegetical method . This means that for Luther it is more important that the Bible is reasonable according to the reality outside of the scriptures than that the Bible makes sense to itself , that it has internal coherence . The right tool for understanding the world outside of the Bible for Luther is none other than reason , which for him is the field of science , philosophy , history and empirical observation . Here a different picture is presented of a Luther who deeply valued both faith and reason , and held them in dialectical partnership . Luther 's concern thus in separating them is honoring their different epistemological spheres .
As a non-directive and flexible analytical tool , the concept of boundaries helps both to map and to define the changeability and mutability that are characteristic of people 's experiences of the self in society . While identity is a volatile , flexible and abstract 'thing ' , its manifestations and the ways in which it is exercised are often open to view . Identity is made evident through the use of markers such as language , dress , behaviour and choice of space , whose effect depends on their recognition by other social beings . Markers help to create the boundaries that define similarities or differences between the marker wearer and the marker perceivers , their effectiveness depends on a shared understanding of their meaning . In a social context , misunderstandings can arise due to a misinterpretation of the significance of specific markers . Equally , an individual can use markers of identity to exert influence on other people without necessarily fulfilling all the criteria that an external observer might typically associate with such an abstract identity .
In January 1519 , at Altenburg in Saxony , the papal nuncio Karl von Miltitz adopted a more conciliatory approach . Luther made certain concessions to the Saxon , who was a relative of the Elector , and promised to remain silent if his opponents did . The theologian Johann Eck , however , was determined to expose Luther 's doctrine in a public forum . In June and July 1519 , he staged a disputation with Luther 's colleague Andreas Karlstadt at Leipzig and invited Luther to speak . Luther 's boldest assertion in the debate was that Matthew 16:18 does not confer on popes the exclusive right to interpret scripture , and that therefore neither popes nor church councils were infallible . For this , Eck branded Luther a new Jan Hus , referring to the Czech reformer and heretic burned at the stake in 1415 . From that moment , he devoted himself to Luther 's defeat .
In 1960 , Columbia/CBS began negotiations with its main international distributor Philips Records with the goal of CBS starting its own global record company . Philips ' acquisition of Mercury Records in the US in 1961 paved the way for this . CBS only had the rights to the Columbia name in North America ; therefore the international arm founded in 1961 and launched in 1962 utilized the " CBS Records " name only , with Philips Records distributing the label in Europe . CBS 's Mexican record company , Discos Columbia , was renamed Discos CBS by 1963 .
It is admitted that the doctrine as defined by Pius IX was not explicitly mooted before the 12th century . It is also agreed that " no direct or categorical and stringent proof of the dogma can be brought forward from Scripture " . But it is claimed that the doctrine is implicitly contained in the teaching of the Fathers . Their expressions on the subject of the sinlessness of Mary are , it is pointed out , so ample and so absolute that they must be taken to include original sin as well as actual . Thus in the first five centuries such epithets as " in every respect holy " , " in all things unstained " , " super-innocent " , and " singularly holy " are applied to her ; she is compared to Eve before the fall , as ancestress of a redeemed people ; she is " the earth before it was accursed " . The well-known words of St. Augustine ( d. 430 ) may be cited : " As regards the mother of God , " he says , " I will not allow any question whatever of sin . " It is true that he is here speaking directly of actual or personal sin . But his argument is that all men are sinners ; that they are so through original depravity ; that this original depravity may be overcome by the grace of God , and he adds that he does not know but that Mary may have had sufficient grace to overcome sin " of every sort " ( omni ex parte ) .
In 1929 , ARC was founded through a merger of several smaller record companies , which , ultimately , transformed into one enterprise known as SME . In the depths of the Great Depression , the Columbia Phonograph Company ( founded in 1888 ) in the U.S. ( including its Okeh Records subsidiary ) was acquired by ARC in 1934 .
The Ptolemaic Kingdom was a powerful Hellenistic state , extending from southern Syria in the east , to Cyrene to the west , and south to the frontier with Nubia . Alexandria became the capital city and a centre of Greek culture and trade . To gain recognition by the native Egyptian populace , they named themselves as the successors to the Pharaohs . The later Ptolemies took on Egyptian traditions , had themselves portrayed on public monuments in Egyptian style and dress , and participated in Egyptian religious life .
Numerous modern mandolin makers build instruments that largely replicate the Gibson F-5 Artist models built in the early 1920s under the supervision of Gibson acoustician Lloyd Loar . Original Loar-signed instruments are sought after and extremely valuable . Other makers from the Loar period and earlier include Lyon and Healy , Vega and Larson Brothers . Some notable modern American carved mandolin manufacturers include , in addition to Kay , Gibson , Weber , Monteleone and Collings . Mandolins from other countries include The Loar ( China ) , Santa , Rosa ( China ) , Michael Kelly ( Korea ) , Eastman ( China ) , Kentucky ( China ) , Heiden ( Canada ) , Gilchrist ( Australia ) and Morgan Monroe ( China ) .
About 150,000 East African and black people live in Israel , amounting to just over 2 % of the nation 's population . The vast majority of these , some 120,000 , are Beta Israel , most of whom are recent immigrants who came during the 1980s and 1990s from Ethiopia . In addition , Israel is home to over 5,000 members of the African Hebrew Israelites of Jerusalem movement that are descendants of African Americans who emigrated to Israel in the 20th century , and who reside mainly in a distinct neighborhood in the Negev town of Dimona . Unknown numbers of black converts to Judaism reside in Israel , most of them converts from the United Kingdom , Canada , and the United States .
Several dozen radioisotopes have been characterized . 65Zn , which has a half-life of 243.66 days , is the most long-lived radioisotope , followed by 72Zn with a half-life of 46.5 hours . Zinc has 10 nuclear isomers . 69mZn has the longest half-life , 13.76 h. The superscript m indicates a metastable isotope . The nucleus of a metastable isotope is in an excited state and will return to the ground state by emitting a photon in the form of a gamma ray . 61Zn has three excited states and 73Zn has two . The isotopes 65Zn , 71Zn , 77Zn and 78Zn each have only one excited state .
Erik Erikson ( 1902-1994 ) became one of the earliest psychologists to take an explicit interest in identity . The Eriksonian framework rests upon a distinction among the psychological sense of continuity , known as the ego identity ( sometimes identified simply as " the self " ) ; the personal idiosyncrasies that separate one person from the next , known as the personal identity ; and the collection of social roles that a person might play , known as either the social identity or the cultural identity . Erikson 's work , in the psychodynamic tradition , aimed to investigate the process of identity formation across a lifespan . Progressive strength in the ego identity , for example , can be charted in terms of a series of stages in which identity is formed in response to increasingly sophisticated challenges . The process of forming a viable sense of identity for the culture is conceptualized as an adolescent task , and those who do not manage a resynthesis of childhood identifications are seen as being in a state of 'identity diffusion ' whereas those who retain their initially given identities unquestioned have 'foreclosed ' identities ( Weinreich & Saunderson 2003 p7-8 ) . On some readings of Erikson , the development of a strong ego identity , along with the proper integration into a stable society and culture , lead to a stronger sense of identity in general . Accordingly , a deficiency in either of these factors may increase the chance of an identity crisis or confusion ( Cote & Levine 2002 , p. 22 ) .
In South Africa , the period of colonization resulted in many unions and marriages between European men and African women from various tribes , resulting in mixed-race children . As the Europeans acquired territory and imposed rule over the Africans , they generally pushed mixed-race and Africans into second-class status . During the first half of the 20th century , the Afrikaaner-dominated government classified the population according to four main racial groups : Black , White , Asian ( mostly Indian ) , and Coloured . The Coloured group included people of mixed Bantu , Khoisan , and European descent ( with some Malay ancestry , especially in the Western Cape ) . The Coloured definition occupied an intermediary political position between the Black and White definitions in South Africa . It imposed a system of legal racial segregation , a complex of laws known as apartheid .
Carolina suffered a major setback when Thomas Davis , an 11-year veteran who had already overcome three ACL tears in his career , went down with a broken arm in the NFC Championship Game . Despite this , he insisted he would still find a way to play in the Super Bowl . His prediction turned out to be accurate .
The inclusiveness of Weinreich 's definition ( above ) directs attention to the totality of one 's identity at a given phase in time , and assists in elucidating component aspects of one 's total identity , such as one 's gender identity , ethnic identity , occupational identity and so on . The definition readily applies to the young child , to the adolescent , to the young adult , and to the older adult in various phases of the life cycle . Depending on whether one is a young child or an adult at the height of one 's powers , how one construes oneself as one was in the past will refer to very different salient experiential markers . Likewise , how one construes oneself as one aspires to be in the future will differ considerably according to one 's age and accumulated experiences . ( Weinreich & Saunderson , ( eds ) 2003 , pp 26–34 ) .
Cardinal bishops ( cardinals of the episcopal order ) are among the most senior prelates of the Catholic Church . Though in modern times most cardinals are also bishops , the term " cardinal bishop " only refers to the cardinals who are titular bishops of one of the " suburbicarian " sees .
In accordance with his father 's wishes , Luther enrolled in law school at the same university that year but dropped out almost immediately , believing that law represented uncertainty . Luther sought assurances about life and was drawn to theology and philosophy , expressing particular interest in Aristotle , William of Ockham , and Gabriel Biel . He was deeply influenced by two tutors , Bartholomaeus Arnoldi von Usingen and Jodocus Trutfetter , who taught him to be suspicious of even the greatest thinkers and to test everything himself by experience . Philosophy proved to be unsatisfying , offering assurance about the use of reason but none about loving God , which to Luther was more important . Reason could not lead men to God , he felt , and he thereafter developed a love-hate relationship with Aristotle over the latter 's emphasis on reason . For Luther , reason could be used to question men and institutions , but not God . Human beings could learn about God only through divine revelation , he believed , and Scripture therefore became increasingly important to him .
The annual NFL Experience was held at the Moscone Center in San Francisco . In addition , " Super Bowl City " opened on January 30 at Justin Herman Plaza on The Embarcadero , featuring games and activities that will highlight the Bay Area 's technology , culinary creations , and cultural diversity . More than 1 million people are expected to attend the festivities in San Francisco during Super Bowl Week . San Francisco mayor Ed Lee said of the highly visible homeless presence in this area " they are going to have to leave " . San Francisco city supervisor Jane Kim unsuccessfully lobbied for the NFL to reimburse San Francisco for city services in the amount of $ 5 million .
The Broncos ' defense ranked first in the NFL yards allowed ( 4,530 ) for the first time in franchise history , and fourth in points allowed ( 296 ) . Defensive ends Derek Wolfe and Malik Jackson each had 5½ sacks . Pro Bowl linebacker Von Miller led the team with 11 sacks , forced four fumbles , and recovered three . Linebacker DeMarcus Ware was selected to play in the Pro Bowl for the ninth time in his career , ranking second on the team with 7½ sacks . Linebacker Brandon Marshall led the team in total tackles with 109 , while Danny Trevathan ranked second with 102 . Cornerbacks Aqib Talib ( three interceptions ) and Chris Harris , Jr. ( two interceptions ) were the other two Pro Bowl selections from the defense .
Luther was a prolific hymn-writer , authoring hymns such as " Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott " ( " A Mighty Fortress Is Our God " ) , based on Psalm 46 , and " Vom Himmel hoch , da komm ich her " ( " From Heaven Above to Earth I Come " ) , based on Luke 2:11–12 . Luther connected high art and folk music , also all classes , clergy and laity , men , women and children . His tool of choice for this connection was the singing of German hymns in connection with worship , school , home , and the public arena . He often accompanied the sung hymns with a lute , later recreated as the waldzither that became a national instrument of Germany in the 20th century .
The rise of Islam , based on both the Qur'an and Muhammad strongly altered the power balances and perceptions of origin of power in the Mediterranean region . Early Islamic philosophy emphasized an inexorable link between science and religion , and the process of ijtihad to find truth—in effect all philosophy was " political " as it had real implications for governance . This view was challenged by the " rationalist " Mutazilite philosophers , who held a more Hellenic view , reason above revelation , and as such are known to modern scholars as the first speculative theologians of Islam ; they were supported by a secular aristocracy who sought freedom of action independent of the Caliphate . By the late ancient period , however , the " traditionalist " Asharite view of Islam had in general triumphed . According to the Asharites , reason must be subordinate to the Quran and the Sunna .
Although Foo Fighters continued to be one of the most successful rock acts , with albums like In Your Honor ( 2005 ) reaching number two in the US and UK , many of the first wave of post-grunge bands began to fade in popularity . Acts like Creed , Staind , Puddle of Mudd and Nickelback took the genre into the 2000s with considerable commercial success , abandoning most of the angst and anger of the original movement for more conventional anthems , narratives and romantic songs . They were followed in this vein by new acts including Shinedown and Seether . Acts with more conventional hard rock sounds included Andrew W.K. , Beautiful Creatures and Buckcherry , whose breakthrough album 15 ( 2006 ) went platinum and spawned the single " Sorry " ( 2007 ) , which made the Top 10 of the Billboard 100 . These were joined by bands with hard rock leanings that emerged in the mid-2000s from the garage rock or post punk revival , including Black Rebel Motorcycle Club and Kings of Leon , and Queens of the Stone Age from the US , Three Days Grace from Canada , Jet from Australia and The Datsuns from New Zealand . In 2009 Them Crooked Vultures , a supergroup that brought together Foo Fighters ' Dave Grohl , Queens of the Stone Age 's Josh Homme and Led Zeppelin bass player John Paul Jones attracted attention as a live act and released a self-titled debut album that reached the top 20 in the US and UK and the top ten in several other countries .
With 4:51 left in regulation , Carolina got the ball on their own 24-yard line with a chance to mount a game-winning drive , and soon faced 3rd-and-9 . On the next play , Miller stripped the ball away from Newton , and after several players dove for it , it took a long bounce backwards and was recovered by Ward , who returned it five yards to the Panthers 4-yard line . Although several players dove into the pile to attempt to recover it , Newton did not and his lack of aggression later earned him heavy criticism . Meanwhile , Denver 's offense was kept out of the end zone for three plays , but a holding penalty on cornerback Josh Norman gave the Broncos a new set of downs . Then Anderson scored on a 2-yard touchdown run and Manning completed a pass to Bennie Fowler for a 2-point conversion , giving Denver a 24–10 lead with 3:08 left and essentially putting the game away . Carolina had two more drives , but failed to get a first down on each one .
Peyton Manning became the first quarterback ever to lead two different teams to multiple Super Bowls . He is also the oldest quarterback ever to play in a Super Bowl at age 39 . The past record was held by John Elway , who led the Broncos to victory in Super Bowl XXXIII at age 38 and is currently Denver 's Executive Vice President of Football Operations and General Manager .
From outside the United Kingdom and the United States , the Canadian trio Rush released three distinctively hard rock albums in 1974–75 ( Rush , Fly by Night and Caress of Steel ) before moving toward a more progressive sound with the 1976 album 2112 . The Irish band Thin Lizzy , which had formed in the late 1960s , made their most substantial commercial breakthrough in 1976 with the hard rock album Jailbreak and their worldwide hit " The Boys Are Back in Town " , which reached number 8 in the UK and number 12 in the US . Their style , consisting of two duelling guitarists often playing leads in harmony , proved itself to be a large influence on later bands . They reached their commercial , and arguably their artistic peak with Black Rose : A Rock Legend ( 1979 ) . The arrival of Scorpions from Germany marked the geographical expansion of the subgenre . Australian-formed AC/DC , with a stripped back , riff heavy and abrasive style that also appealed to the punk generation , began to gain international attention from 1976 , culminating in the release of their multi-platinum albums Let There Be Rock ( 1977 ) and Highway to Hell ( 1979 ) . Also influenced by a punk ethos were heavy metal bands like Motörhead , while Judas Priest abandoned the remaining elements of the blues in their music , further differentiating the hard rock and heavy metal styles and helping to create the New Wave of British Heavy Metal which was pursued by bands like Iron Maiden , Saxon and Venom .
The transition from the mandolino to the mandolin began around 1744 with the designing of the metal-string mandolin by the Vinaccia family , 3 brass strings and one of gut , using friction tuning pegs on a fingerboard that sat " flush " with the sound table . The mandolin grew in popularity over the next 60 years , in the streets where it was used by young men courting and by street musicians , and in the concert hall . After the Napoleonic Wars of 1815 , however , its popularity began to fall . The 19th century produced some prominent players , including Bartolomeo Bortolazzi of Venice and Pietro Vimercati . However , professional virtuosity was in decline , and the mandolin music changed as the mandolin became a folk instrument ; " the large repertoire of notated instrumental music for the mandolino and the mandoline was completely forgotten " . The export market for mandolins from Italy dried up around 1815 , and when Carmine de Laurentiis wrote a mandolin method in 1874 , the Music World magazine wrote that the mandolin was " out of date . " Salvador Léonardi mentioned this decline in his 1921 book , Méthode pour Banjoline ou Mandoline-Banjo , saying that the mandolin had been declining in popularity from previous times .
In 1516 , Johann Tetzel , a Dominican friar and papal commissioner for indulgences , was sent to Germany by the Roman Catholic Church to sell indulgences to raise money to rebuild St. Peter 's Basilica in Rome . Roman Catholic theology stated that faith alone , whether fiduciary or dogmatic , can not justify man ; justification rather depends only on such faith as is active in charity and good works ( fides caritate formata ) . The benefits of good works could be obtained by donating money to the church .

He later attributed his decision to an event : on 2 July 1505 , he was returning to university on horseback after a trip home . During a thunderstorm , a lightning bolt struck near him . Later telling his father he was terrified of death and divine judgment , he cried out , " Help ! Saint Anna , I will become a monk ! " He came to view his cry for help as a vow he could never break . He left law school , sold his books , and entered a closed Augustinian cloister in Erfurt on 17 July 1505 . One friend blamed the decision on Luther 's sadness over the deaths of two friends . Luther himself seemed saddened by the move . Those who attended a farewell supper walked him to the door of the Black Cloister . " This day you see me , and then , not ever again , " he said . His father was furious over what he saw as a waste of Luther 's education .

Islamic political philosophy , was , indeed , rooted in the very sources of Islam—i.e. , the Qur'an and the Sunnah , the words and practices of Muhammad—thus making it essentially theocratic . However , in the Western thought , it is generally supposed that it was a specific area peculiar merely to the great philosophers of Islam : al-Kindi ( Alkindus ) , al-Farabi ( Abunaser ) , İbn Sina ( Avicenna ) , Ibn Bajjah ( Avempace ) , Ibn Rushd ( Averroes ) , and Ibn Khaldun . The political conceptions of Islam such as kudrah ( power ) , sultan , ummah , cemaa ( obligation ) -and even the " core " terms of the Qur'an—i.e. , ibadah ( worship ) , din ( religion ) , rab ( master ) and ilah ( deity ) —is taken as the basis of an analysis . Hence , not only the ideas of the Muslim political philosophers but also many other jurists and ulama posed political ideas and theories . For example , the ideas of the Khawarij in the very early years of Islamic history on Khilafa and Ummah , or that of Shia Islam on the concept of Imamah are considered proofs of political thought . The clashes between the Ehl-i Sunna and Shia in the 7th and 8th centuries had a genuine political character .
After a punt from both teams , Carolina got on track with a 9-play , 73-yard scoring drive . Newton completed 4 of 4 passes for 51 yards and rushed twice for 25 yards , while Jonathan Stewart finished the drive with a 1-yard touchdown run , cutting the score to 10–7 with 11:28 left in the second quarter . Later on , Broncos receiver Jordan Norwood received Brad Nortman 's short 28-yard punt surrounded by Panthers players , but none of them attempted to make a tackle , apparently thinking Norwood had called a fair catch . Norwood had not done so , and with no resistance around him , he took off for a Super Bowl record 61-yard return before Mario Addison dragged him down on the Panthers 14-yard line . Despite Denver 's excellent field position , they could not get the ball into the end zone , so McManus kicked a 33-yard field goal that increased their lead to 13–7 .
The U.S. census race definitions says a " black " is a person having origins in any of the black ( sub-Saharan ) racial groups of Africa . It includes people who indicate their race as " Black , African Am. , or Negro " or who provide written entries such as African American , Afro-American , Kenyan , Nigerian , or Haitian . The Census Bureau notes that these classifications are socio-political constructs and should not be interpreted as scientific or anthropological . Most African Americans also have European ancestry in varying amounts ; a lesser proportion have some Native American ancestry . For instance , genetic studies of African Americans show an ancestry that is on average 17–18 % European .
Luther devised the catechism as a method of imparting the basics of Christianity to the congregations . In 1529 , he wrote the Large Catechism , a manual for pastors and teachers , as well as a synopsis , the Small Catechism , to be memorised by the people themselves . The catechisms provided easy-to-understand instructional and devotional material on the Ten Commandments , the Apostles ' Creed , the Lord 's Prayer , baptism , and the Lord 's Supper . Luther incorporated questions and answers in the catechism so that the basics of Christian faith would not just be learned by rote , " the way monkeys do it " , but understood .
In 1542 , Luther read a Latin translation of the Qur'an . He went on to produce several critical pamphlets on Islam , which he called " Mohammedanism " or " the Turk " . Though Luther saw the Muslim faith as a tool of the devil , he was indifferent to its practice : " Let the Turk believe and live as he will , just as one lets the papacy and other false Christians live . " He opposed banning the publication of the Qur'an , wanting it exposed to scrutiny .
The report " Mary : Faith and Hope in Christ " , by the Anglican-Roman Catholic International Commission , concluded that the teaching about Mary in the two definitions of the Assumption and the Immaculate Conception can be said to be consonant with the teaching of the Scriptures and the ancient common traditions . But the report expressed concerns that the Roman Catholic dogmatic definitions of these concepts implies them to be " revealed by God " , stating : " The question arises for Anglicans , however , as to whether these doctrines concerning Mary are revealed by God in a way which must be held by believers as a matter of faith . "
The Suez Canal , built in partnership with the French , was completed in 1869 . Its construction led to enormous debt to European banks , and caused popular discontent because of the onerous taxation it required . In 1875 Ismail was forced to sell Egypt 's share in the canal to the British Government . Within three years this led to the imposition of British and French controllers who sat in the Egyptian cabinet , and , " with the financial power of the bondholders behind them , were the real power in the Government . "
BSkyB has no veto over the presence of channels on their EPG , with open access being an enforced part of their operating licence from Ofcom . Any channel which can get carriage on a suitable beam of a satellite at 28° East is entitled to access to BSkyB 's EPG for a fee , ranging from £15–100,000 . Third-party channels which opt for encryption receive discounts ranging from reduced price to free EPG entries , free carriage on a BSkyB leased transponder , or actual payment for being carried . However , even in this case , BSkyB does not carry any control over the channel 's content or carriage issues such as picture quality .
By that time , the majority of black people in the United States were native-born , so the use of the term " African " became problematic . Though initially a source of pride , many blacks feared that the use of African as an identity would be a hindrance to their fight for full citizenship in the US . They also felt that it would give ammunition to those who were advocating repatriating black people back to Africa . In 1835 , black leaders called upon Black Americans to remove the title of " African " from their institutions and replace it with " Negro " or " Colored American " . A few institutions chose to keep their historic names , such as the African Methodist Episcopal Church . African Americans popularly used the terms " Negro " or " colored " for themselves until the late 1960s .
The city council of the city of Bern decided against having twinned cities except for a temporary ( during the UEFA Euro 2008 ) cooperation with the Austrian city Salzburg
As of 2000 [ update ] , children and teenagers ( 0–19 years old ) make up 15.1 % of the population , while adults ( 20–64 years old ) make up 65 % and seniors ( over 64 years old ) make up 19.9 % .

On the island of Crete , along with the lyra and the laouto ( lute ) , the mandolin is one of the main instruments used in Cretan Music . It appeared on Crete around the time of the Venetian rule of the island . Different variants of the mandolin , such as the " mantola , " were used to accompany the lyra , the violin , and the laouto . Stelios Foustalierakis reported that the mandolin and the mpoulgari were used to accompany the lyra in the beginning of the 20th century in the city of Rethimno . There are also reports that the mandolin was mostly a woman 's musical instrument . Nowadays it is played mainly as a solo instrument in personal and family events on the Ionian islands and Crete .
Another misunderstanding is that , by her immaculate conception , Mary did not need a saviour . When defining the dogma in Ineffabilis Deus , Pope Pius IX explicitly affirmed that Mary was redeemed in a manner more sublime . He stated that Mary , rather than being cleansed after sin , was completely prevented from contracting Original Sin in view of the foreseen merits of Jesus Christ , the Savior of the human race . In Luke 1:47 , Mary proclaims : " My spirit has rejoiced in God my Saviour . " This is referred to as Mary 's pre-redemption by Christ . Since the Second Council of Orange against semi-pelagianism , the Catholic Church has taught that even had man never sinned in the Garden of Eden and was sinless , he would still require God 's grace to remain sinless .
CBS set the base rate for a 30-second advertisement at $ 5,000,000 , a record high price for a Super Bowl ad . As of January 26 , the advertisements had not yet sold out . CBS mandated that all advertisers purchase a package covering time on both the television and digital broadcasts of the game , meaning that for the first time , digital streams of the game would carry all national advertising in pattern with the television broadcast . This would be the final year in a multi-year contract with Anheuser-Busch InBev that allowed the beer manufacturer to air multiple advertisements during the game at a steep discount . It was also the final year that Doritos , a longtime sponsor of the game , held its " Crash the Super Bowl " contest that allowed viewers to create their own Doritos ads for a chance to have it aired during the game . Nintendo and The Pokémon Company also made their Super Bowl debut , promoting the 20th anniversary of the Pokémon video game and media franchise .
Groups that emerged from the American psychedelic scene about the same time included Iron Butterfly , MC5 , Blue Cheer and Vanilla Fudge . San Francisco band Blue Cheer released a crude and distorted cover of Eddie Cochran 's classic " Summertime Blues " , from their 1968 debut album Vincebus Eruptum , that outlined much of the later hard rock and heavy metal sound . The same month , Steppenwolf released its self-titled debut album , including " Born to Be Wild " , which contained the first lyrical reference to heavy metal and helped popularise the style when it was used in the film Easy Rider ( 1969 ) . Iron Butterfly 's In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida ( 1968 ) , with its 17-minute-long title track , using organs and with a lengthy drum solo , also prefigured later elements of the sound .
Following their loss in the divisional round of the previous season 's playoffs , the Denver Broncos underwent numerous coaching changes , including a mutual parting with head coach John Fox ( who had won four divisional championships in his four years as Broncos head coach ) , and the hiring of Gary Kubiak as the new head coach . Under Kubiak , the Broncos planned to install a run-oriented offense with zone blocking to blend in with quarterback Peyton Manning 's shotgun passing skills , but struggled with numerous changes and injuries to the offensive line , as well as Manning having his worst statistical season since his rookie year with the Indianapolis Colts in 1998 , due to a plantar fasciitis injury in his heel that he had suffered since the summer , and the simple fact that Manning was getting old , as he turned 39 in the 2015 off-season . Although the team had a 7–0 start , Manning led the NFL in interceptions . In week 10 , Manning suffered a partial tear of the plantar fasciitis in his left foot . He set the NFL 's all-time record for career passing yards in this game , but was benched after throwing four interceptions in favor of backup quarterback Brock Osweiler , who took over as the starter for most of the remainder of the regular season . Osweiler was injured , however , leading to Manning 's return during the Week 17 regular season finale , where the Broncos were losing 13–7 against the 4–11 San Diego Chargers , resulting in Manning re-claiming the starting quarterback position for the playoffs by leading the team to a key 27–20 win that enabled the team to clinch the number one overall AFC seed . Under defensive coordinator Wade Phillips , the Broncos ' defense ranked number one in total yards allowed , passing yards allowed and sacks , and like the previous three seasons , the team has continued to set numerous individual , league and franchise records . With the defense carrying the team despite the issues with the offense , the Broncos finished the regular season with a 12–4 record and earned home-field advantage throughout the AFC playoffs .
After each team punted , Panthers quarterback Cam Newton appeared to complete a 24-yard pass Jerricho Cotchery , but the call was ruled an incompletion and upheld after a replay challenge . CBS analyst and retired referee Mike Carey stated he disagreed with the call and felt the review clearly showed the pass was complete . A few plays later , on 3rd-and-10 from the 15-yard line , linebacker Von Miller knocked the ball out of Newton 's hands while sacking him , and Malik Jackson recovered it in the end zone for a Broncos touchdown , giving the team a 10–0 lead . This was the first fumble return touchdown in a Super Bowl since Super Bowl XXVIII at the end of the 1993 season .
There would be no more scoring in the third quarter , but early in the fourth , the Broncos drove to the Panthers 41-yard line . On the next play , Ealy knocked the ball out of Manning 's hand as he was winding up for a pass , and then recovered it for Carolina on the 50-yard line . A 16-yard reception by Devin Funchess and a 12-yard run by Stewart then set up Gano 's 39-yard field goal , cutting the Panthers deficit to one score at 16–10 . The next three drives of the game would end in punts .
Zinc deficiency is crop plants ' most common micronutrient deficiency ; it is particularly common in high-pH soils . Zinc-deficient soil is cultivated in the cropland of about half of Turkey and India , a third of China , and most of Western Australia , and substantial responses to zinc fertilization have been reported in these areas . Plants that grow in soils that are zinc-deficient are more susceptible to disease . Zinc is primarily added to the soil through the weathering of rocks , but humans have added zinc through fossil fuel combustion , mine waste , phosphate fertilizers , pesticide ( zinc phosphide ) , limestone , manure , sewage sludge , and particles from galvanized surfaces . Excess zinc is toxic to plants , although zinc toxicity is far less widespread .
Manning finished the year with a career-low 67.9 passer rating , throwing for 2,249 yards and nine touchdowns , with 17 interceptions . In contrast , Osweiler threw for 1,967 yards , 10 touchdowns and six interceptions for a rating of 86.4 . Veteran receiver Demaryius Thomas led the team with 105 receptions for 1,304 yards and six touchdowns , while Emmanuel Sanders caught 76 passes for 1,135 yards and six scores , while adding another 106 yards returning punts . Tight end Owen Daniels was also a big element of the passing game with 46 receptions for 517 yards . Running back C. J. Anderson was the team 's leading rusher 863 yards and seven touchdowns , while also catching 25 passes for 183 yards . Running back Ronnie Hillman also made a big impact with 720 yards , five touchdowns , 24 receptions , and a 4.7 yards per carry average . Overall , the offense ranked 19th in scoring with 355 points and did not have any Pro Bowl selections .
Binary compounds of zinc are known for most of the metalloids and all the nonmetals except the noble gases . The oxide ZnO is a white powder that is nearly insoluble in neutral aqueous solutions , but is amphoteric , dissolving in both strong basic and acidic solutions . The other chalcogenides ( ZnS , ZnSe , and ZnTe ) have varied applications in electronics and optics . Pnictogenides ( Zn 3N 2 , Zn 3P 2 , Zn 3As 2 and Zn 3Sb 2 ) , the peroxide ( ZnO 2 ) , the hydride ( ZnH 2 ) , and the carbide ( ZnC 2 ) are also known . Of the four halides , ZnF 2 has the most ionic character , whereas the others ( ZnCl 2 , ZnBr 2 , and ZnI 2 ) have relatively low melting points and are considered to have more covalent character .
In the United States , the game was televised by CBS , as part of a cycle between the three main broadcast television partners of the NFL . The network 's lead broadcast team of Jim Nantz and Phil Simms called the contest , with Tracy Wolfson and Evan Washburn on the sidelines . CBS introduced new features during the telecast , including pylon cameras and microphones along with EyeVision 360—an array of 36 cameras along the upper deck that can be used to provide a 360-degree view of plays and " bullet time " effects . ( An earlier version of EyeVision was last used in Super Bowl XXXV ; for Super Bowl 50 , the cameras were upgraded to 5K resolution . )
The effect of Luther 's intervention was immediate . After the sixth sermon , the Wittenberg jurist Jerome Schurf wrote to the elector : " Oh , what joy has Dr. Martin 's return spread among us ! His words , through divine mercy , are bringing back every day misguided people into the way of the truth . "
The Neapolitan style has an almond-shaped body resembling a bowl , constructed from curved strips of wood . It usually has a bent sound table , canted in two planes with the design to take the tension of the 8 metal strings arranged in four courses . A hardwood fingerboard sits on top of or is flush with the sound table . Very old instruments may use wooden tuning pegs , while newer instruments tend to use geared metal tuners . The bridge is a movable length of hardwood . A pickguard is glued below the sound hole under the strings . European roundbacks commonly use a 13-inch scale instead of the 13.876 common on archtop Mandolins .
Without Luther 's backing for the uprising , many rebels laid down their weapons ; others felt betrayed . Their defeat by the Swabian League at the Battle of Frankenhausen on 15 May 1525 , followed by Müntzer 's execution , brought the revolutionary stage of the Reformation to a close . Thereafter , radicalism found a refuge in the anabaptist movement and other religious movements , while Luther 's Reformation flourished under the wing of the secular powers .
Several dozen radioisotopes have been characterized . 65Zn , which has a half-life of 243.66 days , is the most long-lived radioisotope , followed by 72Zn with a half-life of 46.5 hours . Zinc has 10 nuclear isomers . 69mZn has the longest half-life , 13.76 h. The superscript m indicates a metastable isotope . The nucleus of a metastable isotope is in an excited state and will return to the ground state by emitting a photon in the form of a gamma ray . 61Zn has three excited states and 73Zn has two . The isotopes 65Zn , 71Zn , 77Zn and 78Zn each have only one excited state .
Western political philosophy originates in the philosophy of ancient Greece , where political philosophy dates back to at least Plato . Ancient Greece was dominated by city-states , which experimented with various forms of political organization , grouped by Plato into four categories : timocracy , tyranny , democracy and oligarchy . One of the first , extremely important classical works of political philosophy is Plato 's Republic , which was followed by Aristotle 's Nichomachean Ethics and Politics . Roman political philosophy was influenced by the Stoics , including the Roman statesman Cicero .
Another family of bowlback mandolins came from Milan and Lombardy . These mandolins are closer to the mandolino or mandore than other modern mandolins . They are shorter and wider than the standard Neapolitan mandolin , with a shallow back . The instruments have 6 strings , 3 wire treble-strings and 3 gut or wire-wrapped-silk bass-strings . The strings ran between the tuning pegs and a bridge that was glued to the soundboard , as a guitar 's . The Lombardic mandolins were tuned g b e ' a ' d " g " . A developer of the Milanese stye was Antonio Monzino ( Milan ) and his family who made them for 6 generations .
The structure of Bern 's city centre is largely medieval and has been recognised by UNESCO as a Cultural World Heritage Site . Perhaps its most famous sight is the Zytglogge ( Bernese German for " Time Bell " ) , an elaborate medieval clock tower with moving puppets . It also has an impressive 15th century Gothic cathedral , the Münster , and a 15th-century town hall . Thanks to 6 kilometres ( 4 miles ) of arcades , the old town boasts one of the longest covered shopping promenades in Europe .
CBS provided digital streams of the game via CBSSports.com , and the CBS Sports apps on tablets , Windows 10 , Xbox One and other digital media players ( such as Chromecast and Roku ) . Due to Verizon Communications exclusivity , streaming on smartphones was only provided to Verizon Wireless customers via the NFL Mobile service . The ESPN Deportes Spanish broadcast was made available through WatchESPN .

Carolina suffered a major setback when Thomas Davis , an 11-year veteran who had already overcome three ACL tears in his career , went down with a broken arm in the NFC Championship Game . Despite this , he insisted he would still find a way to play in the Super Bowl . His prediction turned out to be accurate .
Bern was a candidate to host the 2010 Winter Olympics , but withdrew its bid in September 2002 after a referendum was passed that showed that the bid was not supported by locals . Those games were eventually awarded to Vancouver , Canada .
Pope Sixtus V limited the number of cardinals to 70 , comprising six cardinal bishops , 50 cardinal priests , and 14 cardinal deacons . Starting in the pontificate of Pope John XXIII , that limit has been exceeded . At the start of 1971 , Pope Paul VI set the number of cardinal electors at a maximum of 120 , but set no limit on the number of cardinals generally . He also established a maximum age of eighty years for electors . His action deprived twenty-five living cardinals , including the three living cardinals elevated by Pope Pius XI , of the right to participate in a conclave . [ citation needed ] Popes can dispense from church laws and have sometimes brought the number of cardinals under the age of 80 to more than 120 . Pope Paul VI also increased the number of cardinal bishops by giving that rank to patriarchs of the Eastern Catholic Churches .
In January 1519 , at Altenburg in Saxony , the papal nuncio Karl von Miltitz adopted a more conciliatory approach . Luther made certain concessions to the Saxon , who was a relative of the Elector , and promised to remain silent if his opponents did . The theologian Johann Eck , however , was determined to expose Luther 's doctrine in a public forum . In June and July 1519 , he staged a disputation with Luther 's colleague Andreas Karlstadt at Leipzig and invited Luther to speak . Luther 's boldest assertion in the debate was that Matthew 16:18 does not confer on popes the exclusive right to interpret scripture , and that therefore neither popes nor church councils were infallible . For this , Eck branded Luther a new Jan Hus , referring to the Czech reformer and heretic burned at the stake in 1415 . From that moment , he devoted himself to Luther 's defeat .
The Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life ranks Egypt as the fifth worst country in the world for religious freedom . The United States Commission on International Religious Freedom , a bipartisan independent agency of the US government , has placed Egypt on its watch list of countries that require close monitoring due to the nature and extent of violations of religious freedom engaged in or tolerated by the government . According to a 2010 Pew Global Attitudes survey , 84 % of Egyptians polled supported the death penalty for those who leave Islam ; 77 % supported whippings and cutting off of hands for theft and robbery ; and 82 % support stoning a person who commits adultery .
The New Kingdom c. 1550–1070 BC began with the Eighteenth Dynasty , marking the rise of Egypt as an international power that expanded during its greatest extension to an empire as far south as Tombos in Nubia , and included parts of the Levant in the east . This period is noted for some of the most well known Pharaohs , including Hatshepsut , Thutmose III , Akhenaten and his wife Nefertiti , Tutankhamun and Ramesses II . The first historically attested expression of monotheism came during this period as Atenism . Frequent contacts with other nations brought new ideas to the New Kingdom . The country was later invaded and conquered by Libyans , Nubians and Assyrians , but native Egyptians eventually drove them out and regained control of their country .
During the 2009–10 school year , there were a total of 10,979 pupils attending classes in Bern . There were 89 kindergarten classes with a total of 1,641 pupils in the municipality . Of the kindergarten pupils , 32.4 % were permanent or temporary residents of Switzerland ( not citizens ) and 40.2 % have a different mother language than the classroom language . The municipality had 266 primary classes and 5,040 pupils . Of the primary pupils , 30.1 % were permanent or temporary residents of Switzerland ( not citizens ) and 35.7 % have a different mother language than the classroom language . During the same year , there were 151 lower secondary classes with a total of 2,581 pupils . There were 28.7 % who were permanent or temporary residents of Switzerland ( not citizens ) and 32.7 % have a different mother language than the classroom language .
Sony Music Entertainment Inc. ( sometimes known as Sony Music or by the initials , SME ) is an American music corporation managed and operated by Sony Corporation of America ( SCA ) , a subsidiary of Japanese conglomerate Sony Corporation . In 1929 , the enterprise was first founded as American Record Corporation ( ARC ) and , in 1938 , was renamed Columbia Recording Corporation , following ARC 's acquisition by CBS . In 1966 , the company was reorganized to become CBS Records . In 1987 , Sony Corporation of Japan bought the company , and in 1991 , renamed it SME . It is the world 's second largest recorded music company , after Universal Music Group .

On the next play , Ealy knocked the ball out of Manning 's hand as he was winding up for a pass , and then recovered it for Carolina on the 50-yard line . A 16-yard reception by Devin Funchess and a 12-yard run by Stewart then set up Gano 's 39-yard field goal , cutting the Panthers deficit to one score at 16–10 . The next three drives of the game would end in punts .
Some rock musicians today use mandolins , often single-stringed electric models rather than double-stringed acoustic mandolins . One example is Tim Brennan of the Irish-American punk rock band Dropkick Murphys . In addition to electric guitar , bass , and drums , the band uses several instruments associated with traditional Celtic music , including mandolin , tin whistle , and Great Highland bagpipes . The band explains that these instruments accentuate the growling sound they favor . The 1991 R.E.M . hit " Losing My Religion " was driven by a few simple mandolin licks played by guitarist Peter Buck , who also played the mandolin in nearly a dozen other songs . The single peaked at No . 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart ( # 1 on the rock and alternative charts ) , Luther Dickinson of North Mississippi Allstars and The Black Crowes has made frequent use of the mandolin , most notably on the Black Crowes song " Locust Street . " Armenian American rock group System of A Down makes extensive use of the mandolin on their 2005 double album Mezmerize/Hypnotize . Pop punk band Green Day has used a mandolin in several occasions , especially on their 2000 album , Warning . Boyd Tinsley , violin player of the Dave Matthews Band has been using an electric mandolin since 2005 . Frontman Colin Meloy and guitarist Chris Funk of The Decemberists regularly employ the mandolin in the band 's music . Nancy Wilson , rhythm guitarist of Heart , uses a mandolin in Heart 's song " Dream of the Archer " from the album Little Queen , as well as in Heart 's cover of Led Zeppelin 's song " The Battle of Evermore . " " Show Me Heaven " by Maria McKee , the theme song to the film Days of Thunder , prominently features a mandolin .

The element was probably named by the alchemist Paracelsus after the German word Zinke ( prong , tooth ) . German chemist Andreas Sigismund Marggraf is credited with discovering pure metallic zinc in 1746 . Work by Luigi Galvani and Alessandro Volta uncovered the electrochemical properties of zinc by 1800 . Corrosion-resistant zinc plating of iron ( hot-dip galvanizing ) is the major application for zinc . Other applications are in batteries , small non-structural castings , and alloys , such as brass . A variety of zinc compounds are commonly used , such as zinc carbonate and zinc gluconate ( as dietary supplements ) , zinc chloride ( in deodorants ) , zinc pyrithione ( anti-dandruff shampoos ) , zinc sulfide ( in luminescent paints ) , and zinc methyl or zinc diethyl in the organic laboratory .
Alan Dershowitz described Sudan as an example of a government that " actually deserve ( s ) " the appellation " apartheid . " Former Canadian Minister of Justice Irwin Cotler echoed the accusation .
It is admitted that the doctrine as defined by Pius IX was not explicitly mooted before the 12th century . It is also agreed that " no direct or categorical and stringent proof of the dogma can be brought forward from Scripture " . But it is claimed that the doctrine is implicitly contained in the teaching of the Fathers . Their expressions on the subject of the sinlessness of Mary are , it is pointed out , so ample and so absolute that they must be taken to include original sin as well as actual . Thus in the first five centuries such epithets as " in every respect holy " , " in all things unstained " , " super-innocent " , and " singularly holy " are applied to her ; she is compared to Eve before the fall , as ancestress of a redeemed people ; she is " the earth before it was accursed " . The well-known words of St. Augustine ( d. 430 ) may be cited : " As regards the mother of God , " he says , " I will not allow any question whatever of sin . " It is true that he is here speaking directly of actual or personal sin . But his argument is that all men are sinners ; that they are so through original depravity ; that this original depravity may be overcome by the grace of God , and he adds that he does not know but that Mary may have had sufficient grace to overcome sin " of every sort " ( omni ex parte ) .

Luther 's hymns inspired composers to write music . Johann Sebastian Bach included several verses as chorales in his cantatas and based chorale cantatas entirely on them , namely Christ lag in Todes Banden , BWV 4 , as early as possibly 1707 , in his second annual cycle ( 1724 to 1725 ) Ach Gott , vom Himmel sieh darein , BWV 2 , Christ unser Herr zum Jordan kam , BWV 7 , Nun komm , der Heiden Heiland , BWV 62 , Gelobet seist du , Jesu Christ , BWV 91 , and Aus tiefer Not schrei ich zu dir , BWV 38 , later Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott , BWV 80 , and in 1735 Wär Gott nicht mit uns diese Zeit , BWV 14 .
Other widely used alloys that contain zinc include nickel silver , typewriter metal , soft and aluminium solder , and commercial bronze . Zinc is also used in contemporary pipe organs as a substitute for the traditional lead/tin alloy in pipes . Alloys of 85–88 % zinc , 4–10 % copper , and 2–8 % aluminium find limited use in certain types of machine bearings . Zinc is the primary metal used in making American one cent coins since 1982 . The zinc core is coated with a thin layer of copper to give the impression of a copper coin . In 1994 , 33,200 tonnes ( 36,600 short tons ) of zinc were used to produce 13.6 billion pennies in the United States .
The Broncos defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers in the divisional round , 23–16 , by scoring 11 points in the final three minutes of the game . They then beat the defending Super Bowl XLIX champion New England Patriots in the AFC Championship Game , 20–18 , by intercepting a pass on New England 's 2-point conversion attempt with 17 seconds left on the clock . Despite Manning 's problems with interceptions during the season , he did n't throw any in their two playoff games .
The relative reactivity of zinc and its ability to attract oxidation to itself makes it an efficient sacrificial anode in cathodic protection ( CP ) . For example , cathodic protection of a buried pipeline can be achieved by connecting anodes made from zinc to the pipe . Zinc acts as the anode ( negative terminus ) by slowly corroding away as it passes electric current to the steel pipeline . [ note 2 ] Zinc is also used to cathodically protect metals that are exposed to sea water from corrosion . A zinc disc attached to a ship 's iron rudder will slowly corrode , whereas the rudder stays unattacked . Other similar uses include a plug of zinc attached to a propeller or the metal protective guard for the keel of the ship .
Although one of the main obstacles still facing the Egyptian economy is the limited trickle down of wealth to the average population , many Egyptians criticise their government for higher prices of basic goods while their standards of living or purchasing power remains relatively stagnant . Corruption is often cited by Egyptians as the main impediment to further economic growth . The government promised major reconstruction of the country 's infrastructure , using money paid for the newly acquired third mobile license ( $ 3 billion ) by Etisalat in 2006 . In the Corruption Perceptions Index 2013 , Egypt was ranked 114 out of 177 .
For the first time , the Super Bowl 50 Host Committee and the NFL have openly sought disabled veteran and lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender-owned businesses in Business Connect , the Super Bowl program that provides local companies with contracting opportunities in and around the Super Bowl . The host committee has already raised over $ 40 million through sponsors including Apple , Google , Yahoo ! , Intel , Gap , Chevron , and Dignity Health .
These patterns of discrimination against non-whites have led some academic and other activists to advocate for use of the Portuguese term negro to encompass all African-descended people , in order to stimulate a " black " consciousness and identity . This proposal has been criticized since the term pardo is considered to include a wide range of multiracial people , such as caboclos ( mestizos ) , assimilated Amerindians and tri-racials , not only people of partial African and European descent . Trying to identify this entire group as " black " would be a false imposition of a different identity from outside the culture and deny people their other , equally valid , ancestries and cultures . It seems a one-drop rule in reverse .
CBS set the base rate for a 30-second advertisement at $ 5,000,000 , a record high price for a Super Bowl ad . As of January 26 , the advertisements had not yet sold out . CBS mandated that all advertisers purchase a package covering time on both the television and digital broadcasts of the game , meaning that for the first time , digital streams of the game would carry all national advertising in pattern with the television broadcast .

BSkyB launched its HDTV service , Sky+ HD , on 22 May 2006 . Prior to its launch , BSkyB claimed that 40,000 people had registered to receive the HD service . In the week before the launch , rumours started to surface that BSkyB was having supply issues with its set top box ( STB ) from manufacturer Thomson . On Thursday 18 May 2006 , and continuing through the weekend before launch , people were reporting that BSkyB had either cancelled or rescheduled its installation . Finally , the BBC reported that 17,000 customers had yet to receive the service due to failed deliveries . On 31 March 2012 , Sky announced the total number of homes with Sky+HD was 4,222,000 .
Egypt recognises only three religions : Islam , Christianity , and Judaism . Other faiths and minority Muslim sects practised by Egyptians , such as the small Bahá'í and Ahmadi community , are not recognised by the state and face persecution since they are labelled as far right groups that threaten Egypt 's national security . Individuals , particularly Baha'is and atheists , wishing to include their religion ( or lack thereof ) on their mandatory state issued identification cards are denied this ability ( see Egyptian identification card controversy ) , and are put in the position of either not obtaining required identification or lying about their faith . A 2008 court ruling allowed members of unrecognised faiths to obtain identification and leave the religion field blank .
Also in late 1965 , the Date subsidiary label was revived . This label released the first string of hits for Peaches & Herb and scored a few minor hits from various other artists . Date 's biggest success was " Time of the Season " by the Zombies , peaking at # 2 in 1969 . The label was discontinued in 1970 .
Erik Erikson ( 1902-1994 ) became one of the earliest psychologists to take an explicit interest in identity . The Eriksonian framework rests upon a distinction among the psychological sense of continuity , known as the ego identity ( sometimes identified simply as " the self " ) ; the personal idiosyncrasies that separate one person from the next , known as the personal identity ; and the collection of social roles that a person might play , known as either the social identity or the cultural identity . Erikson 's work , in the psychodynamic tradition , aimed to investigate the process of identity formation across a lifespan . Progressive strength in the ego identity , for example , can be charted in terms of a series of stages in which identity is formed in response to increasingly sophisticated challenges . The process of forming a viable sense of identity for the culture is conceptualized as an adolescent task , and those who do not manage a resynthesis of childhood identifications are seen as being in a state of 'identity diffusion ' whereas those who retain their initially given identities unquestioned have 'foreclosed ' identities ( Weinreich & Saunderson 2003 p7-8 ) . On some readings of Erikson , the development of a strong ego identity , along with the proper integration into a stable society and culture , lead to a stronger sense of identity in general . Accordingly , a deficiency in either of these factors may increase the chance of an identity crisis or confusion ( Cote & Levine 2002 , p. 22 ) .
The tradition holds that Virgil was born in the village of Andes , near Mantua in Cisalpine Gaul . Analysis of his name has led to beliefs that he descended from earlier Roman colonists . Modern speculation ultimately is not supported by narrative evidence either from his own writings or his later biographers . Macrobius says that Virgil 's father was of a humble background ; however , scholars generally believe that Virgil was from an equestrian landowning family which could afford to give him an education . He attended schools in Cremona , Mediolanum , Rome and Naples . After considering briefly a career in rhetoric and law , the young Virgil turned his talents to poetry .
The opening years of the 1980s saw a number of changes in personnel and direction of established hard rock acts , including the deaths of Bon Scott , the lead singer of AC/DC , and John Bonham , drummer with Led Zeppelin . Whereas Zeppelin broke up almost immediately afterwards , AC/DC pressed on , recording the album Back in Black ( 1980 ) with their new lead singer , Brian Johnson . It became the fifth-highest-selling album of all time in the US and the second-highest-selling album in the world . Black Sabbath had split with original singer Ozzy Osbourne in 1979 and replaced him with Ronnie James Dio , formerly of Rainbow , giving the band a new sound and a period of creativity and popularity beginning with Heaven and Hell ( 1980 ) . Osbourne embarked on a solo career with Blizzard of Ozz ( 1980 ) , featuring American guitarist Randy Rhoads . Some bands , such as Queen , moved away from their hard rock roots and more towards pop rock , while others , including Rush with Moving Pictures ( 1981 ) , began to return to a hard rock sound . The creation of thrash metal , which mixed heavy metal with elements of hardcore punk from about 1982 , particularly by Metallica , Anthrax , Megadeth and Slayer , helped to create extreme metal and further remove the style from hard rock , although a number of these bands or their members would continue to record some songs closer to a hard rock sound . Kiss moved away from their hard rock roots toward pop metal : firstly removing their makeup in 1983 for their Lick It Up album , and then adopting the visual and sound of glam metal for their 1984 release , Animalize , both of which marked a return to commercial success . Pat Benatar was one of the first women to achieve commercial success in hard rock , with three successive Top 5 albums between 1980 and 1982 .
Luther sympathised with some of the peasants ' grievances , as he showed in his response to the Twelve Articles in May 1525 , but he reminded the aggrieved to obey the temporal authorities . During a tour of Thuringia , he became enraged at the widespread burning of convents , monasteries , bishops ' palaces , and libraries . In Against the Murderous , Thieving Hordes of Peasants , written on his return to Wittenberg , he gave his interpretation of the Gospel teaching on wealth , condemned the violence as the devil 's work , and called for the nobles to put down the rebels like mad dogs :
Following their loss in the divisional round of the previous season 's playoffs , the Denver Broncos underwent numerous coaching changes , including a mutual parting with head coach John Fox ( who had won four divisional championships in his four years as Broncos head coach ) , and the hiring of Gary Kubiak as the new head coach . Under Kubiak , the Broncos planned to install a run-oriented offense with zone blocking to blend in with quarterback Peyton Manning 's shotgun passing skills , but struggled with numerous changes and injuries to the offensive line , as well as Manning having his worst statistical season since his rookie year with the Indianapolis Colts in 1998 , due to a plantar fasciitis injury in his heel that he had suffered since the summer , and the simple fact that Manning was getting old , as he turned 39 in the 2015 off-season . Although the team had a 7–0 start , Manning led the NFL in interceptions . In week 10 , Manning suffered a partial tear of the plantar fasciitis in his left foot . He set the NFL 's all-time record for career passing yards in this game , but was benched after throwing four interceptions in favor of backup quarterback Brock Osweiler , who took over as the starter for most of the remainder of the regular season . Osweiler was injured , however , leading to Manning 's return during the Week 17 regular season finale , where the Broncos were losing 13–7 against the 4–11 San Diego Chargers , resulting in Manning re-claiming the starting quarterback position for the playoffs by leading the team to a key 27–20 win that enabled the team to clinch the number one overall AFC seed . Under defensive coordinator Wade Phillips , the Broncos ' defense ranked number one in total yards allowed , passing yards allowed and sacks , and like the previous three seasons , the team has continued to set numerous individual , league and franchise records . With the defense carrying the team despite the issues with the offense , the Broncos finished the regular season with a 12–4 record and earned home-field advantage throughout the AFC playoffs .
In the 1960s , American and British blues and rock bands began to modify rock and roll by adding harder sounds , heavier guitar riffs , bombastic drumming , and louder vocals , from electric blues . Early forms of hard rock can be heard in the work of Chicago blues musicians Elmore James , Muddy Waters , and Howlin ' Wolf , The Kingsmen 's version of " Louie Louie " ( 1963 ) which made it a garage rock standard , and the songs of rhythm and blues influenced British Invasion acts , including " You Really Got Me " by The Kinks ( 1964 ) , " My Generation " by The Who ( 1965 ) , " Shapes of Things " ( 1966 ) by The Yardbirds and " ( I Ca n't Get No ) Satisfaction " ( 1965 ) by The Rolling Stones . From the late 1960s , it became common to divide mainstream rock music that emerged from psychedelia into soft and hard rock . Soft rock was often derived from folk rock , using acoustic instruments and putting more emphasis on melody and harmonies . In contrast , hard rock was most often derived from blues rock and was played louder and with more intensity .
On June 4 , 2014 , the NFL announced that the practice of branding Super Bowl games with Roman numerals , a practice established at Super Bowl V , would be temporarily suspended , and that the game would be named using Arabic numerals as Super Bowl 50 as opposed to Super Bowl L. The use of Roman numerals will be reinstated for Super Bowl LI . Jaime Weston , the league 's vice president of brand and creative , explained that a primary reason for the change was the difficulty of designing an aesthetically pleasing logo with the letter " L " using the standardized logo template introduced at Super Bowl XLV . The logo also deviates from the template by featuring large numerals , colored in gold , behind the Vince Lombardi Trophy , instead of underneath and in silver as in the standard logo .
Due to the patriarchal nature of Arab society , Arab men , including during the slave trade in North Africa , enslaved more black women than men . They used more black female slaves in domestic service and agriculture than males . The men interpreted the Qur'an to permit sexual relations between a male master and his female slave outside of marriage ( see Ma malakat aymanukum and sex ) , leading to many mixed-race children . When an enslaved woman became pregnant with her Arab master 's child , she was considered as umm walad or " mother of a child " , a status that granted her privileged rights . The child was given rights of inheritance to the father 's property , so mixed-race children could share in any wealth of the father . Because the society was patrilineal , the children took their fathers ' social status at birth and were born free .
World War I was a watershed event in human history , changing views of governments and politics . The Russian Revolution of 1917 ( and similar , albeit less successful , revolutions in many other European countries ) brought communism - and in particular the political theory of Leninism , but also on a smaller level Luxemburgism ( gradually ) - on the world stage . At the same time , social democratic parties won elections and formed governments for the first time , often as a result of the introduction of universal suffrage . However , a group of central European economists led by Austrian School economists Ludwig von Mises and Friedrich Hayek identified the collectivist underpinnings to the various new socialist and fascist doctrines of government power as being different brands of political totalitarianism .
The Broncos ' defense ranked first in the NFL yards allowed ( 4,530 ) for the first time in franchise history , and fourth in points allowed ( 296 ) . Defensive ends Derek Wolfe and Malik Jackson each had 5½ sacks . Pro Bowl linebacker Von Miller led the team with 11 sacks , forced four fumbles , and recovered three . Linebacker DeMarcus Ware was selected to play in the Pro Bowl for the ninth time in his career , ranking second on the team with 7½ sacks . Linebacker Brandon Marshall led the team in total tackles with 109 , while Danny Trevathan ranked second with 102 . Cornerbacks Aqib Talib ( three interceptions ) and Chris Harris , Jr. ( two interceptions ) were the other two Pro Bowl selections from the defense .
Egypt has a developed energy market based on coal , oil , natural gas , and hydro power . Substantial coal deposits in the northeast Sinai are mined at the rate of about 600,000 tonnes ( 590,000 long tons ; 660,000 short tons ) per year . Oil and gas are produced in the western desert regions , the Gulf of Suez , and the Nile Delta . Egypt has huge reserves of gas , estimated at 2,180 cubic kilometres ( 520 cu mi ) , and LNG up to 2012 exported to many countries . In 2013 , the Egyptian General Petroleum Co ( EGPC ) said the country will cut exports of natural gas and tell major industries to slow output this summer to avoid an energy crisis and stave off political unrest , Reuters has reported . Egypt is counting on top liquid natural gas ( LNG ) exporter Qatar to obtain additional gas volumes in summer , while encouraging factories to plan their annual maintenance for those months of peak demand , said EGPC chairman , Tarek El Barkatawy . Egypt produces its own energy , but has been a net oil importer since 2008 and is rapidly becoming a net importer of natural gas .
It seems to have been St Bernard of Clairvaux who , in the 12th century , explicitly raised the question of the Immaculate Conception . A feast of the Conception of the Blessed Virgin had already begun to be celebrated in some churches of the West . St Bernard blames the canons of the metropolitan church of Lyon for instituting such a festival without the permission of the Holy See . In doing so , he takes occasion to repudiate altogether the view that the conception of Mary was sinless . It is doubtful , however , whether he was using the term " conception " in the same sense in which it is used in the definition of Pope Pius IX . Bernard would seem to have been speaking of conception in the active sense of the mother 's cooperation , for in his argument he says : " How can there be absence of sin where there is concupiscence ( libido ) ? " and stronger expressions follow , showing that he is speaking of the mother and not of the child .
With the rise of disco in the US and punk rock in the UK , hard rock 's mainstream dominance was rivalled toward the later part of the decade . Disco appealed to a more diverse group of people and punk seemed to take over the rebellious role that hard rock once held . Early punk bands like The Ramones explicitly rebelled against the drum solos and extended guitar solos that characterised stadium rock , with almost all of their songs clocking in around two minutes with no guitar solos . However , new rock acts continued to emerge and record sales remained high into the 1980s . 1977 saw the début and rise to stardom of Foreigner , who went on to release several platinum albums through to the mid-1980s . Midwestern groups like Kansas , REO Speedwagon and Styx helped further cement heavy rock in the Midwest as a form of stadium rock . In 1978 , Van Halen emerged from the Los Angeles music scene with a sound based around the skills of lead guitarist Eddie Van Halen . He popularised a guitar-playing technique of two-handed hammer-ons and pull-offs called tapping , showcased on the song " Eruption " from the album Van Halen , which was highly influential in re-establishing hard rock as a popular genre after the punk and disco explosion , while also redefining and elevating the role of electric guitar .
This was the first Super Bowl to feature a quarterback on both teams who was the # 1 pick in their draft classes . Manning was the # 1 selection of the 1998 NFL draft , while Newton was picked first in 2011 . The matchup also pits the top two picks of the 2011 draft against each other : Newton for Carolina and Von Miller for Denver . Manning and Newton also set the record for the largest age difference between opposing Super Bowl quarterbacks at 13 years and 48 days ( Manning was 39 , Newton was 26 ) .
Book 1 ( at the head of the Odyssean section ) opens with a storm which Juno , Aeneas ' enemy throughout the poem , stirs up against the fleet . The storm drives the hero to the coast of Carthage , which historically was Rome 's deadliest foe . The queen , Dido , welcomes the ancestor of the Romans , and under the influence of the gods falls deeply in love with him . At a banquet in Book 2 , Aeneas tells the story of the sack of Troy , the death of his wife , and his escape , to the enthralled Carthaginians , while in Book 3 he recounts to them his wanderings over the Mediterranean in search of a suitable new home . Jupiter in Book 4 recalls the lingering Aeneas to his duty to found a new city , and he slips away from Carthage , leaving Dido to commit suicide , cursing Aeneas and calling down revenge in a symbolic anticipation of the fierce wars between Carthage and Rome . In Book 5 , Aeneas ' father Anchises dies and funeral games are celebrated for him . On reaching Cumae , in Italy in Book 6 , Aeneas consults the Cumaean Sibyl , who conducts him through the Underworld where Aeneas meets the dead Anchises who reveals Rome 's destiny to his son .
Emerging British acts included Free , who released their signature song " All Right Now " ( 1970 ) , which has received extensive radio airplay in both the UK and US . After the breakup of the band in 1973 , vocalist Paul Rodgers joined supergroup Bad Company , whose eponymous first album ( 1974 ) was an international hit . The mixture of hard rock and progressive rock , evident in the works of Deep Purple , was pursued more directly by bands like Uriah Heep and Argent . Scottish band Nazareth released their self-titled début album in 1971 , producing a blend of hard rock and pop that would culminate in their best selling , Hair of the Dog ( 1975 ) , which contained the proto-power ballad " Love Hurts " . Having enjoyed some national success in the early 1970s , Queen , after the release of Sheer Heart Attack ( 1974 ) and A Night at the Opera ( 1975 ) , gained international recognition with a sound that used layered vocals and guitars and mixed hard rock with heavy metal , progressive rock , and even opera . The latter featured the single " Bohemian Rhapsody " , which stayed at number one in the UK charts for nine weeks .
Groups that emerged from the American psychedelic scene about the same time included Iron Butterfly , MC5 , Blue Cheer and Vanilla Fudge . San Francisco band Blue Cheer released a crude and distorted cover of Eddie Cochran 's classic " Summertime Blues " , from their 1968 debut album Vincebus Eruptum , that outlined much of the later hard rock and heavy metal sound . The same month , Steppenwolf released its self-titled debut album , including " Born to Be Wild " , which contained the first lyrical reference to heavy metal and helped popularise the style when it was used in the film Easy Rider ( 1969 ) . Iron Butterfly 's In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida ( 1968 ) , with its 17-minute-long title track , using organs and with a lengthy drum solo , also prefigured later elements of the sound .
Virgil 's biographical tradition is thought to depend on a lost biography by Varius , Virgil 's editor , which was incorporated into the biography by Suetonius and the commentaries of Servius and Donatus , the two great commentators on Virgil 's poetry . Although the commentaries no doubt record much factual information about Virgil , some of their evidence can be shown to rely on inferences made from his poetry and allegorizing ; thus , Virgil 's biographical tradition remains problematic .
With 4:51 left in regulation , Carolina got the ball on their own 24-yard line with a chance to mount a game-winning drive , and soon faced 3rd-and-9 . On the next play , Miller stripped the ball away from Newton , and after several players dove for it , it took a long bounce backwards and was recovered by Ward , who returned it five yards to the Panthers 4-yard line . Although several players dove into the pile to attempt to recover it , Newton did not and his lack of aggression later earned him heavy criticism . Meanwhile , Denver 's offense was kept out of the end zone for three plays , but a holding penalty on cornerback Josh Norman gave the Broncos a new set of downs . Then Anderson scored on a 2-yard touchdown run and Manning completed a pass to Bennie Fowler for a 2-point conversion , giving Denver a 24–10 lead with 3:08 left and essentially putting the game away . Carolina had two more drives , but failed to get a first down on each one .
Bern has a population of 140,634 people and 34 % of the population are resident foreign nationals . Over the 10 years between 2000 and 2010 , the population changed at a rate of 0.6 % . Migration accounted for 1.3 % , while births and deaths accounted for −2.1 % .
The implications are multiple as various research traditions are now [ when ? ] heavily utilizing the lens of identity to examine phenomena . [ citation needed ] One implication of identity and of identity construction can be seen in occupational settings . This becomes increasing challenging in stigmatized jobs or " dirty work " ( Hughes , 1951 ) . Tracy and Trethewey ( 2005 ) state that " individuals gravitate toward and turn away from particular jobs depending in part , on the extent to which they validate a " preferred organizational self " ( Tracy & Tretheway 2005 , p. 169 ) . Some jobs carry different stigmas or acclaims . In her analysis Tracy uses the example of correctional officers trying to shake the stigma of " glorified maids " ( Tracy & Tretheway 2005 ) . " The process by which people arrive at justifications of and values for various occupational choices . " Among these are workplace satisfaction and overall quality of life ( Tracy & Scott 2006 , p. 33 ) . People in these types of jobs are forced to find ways in order to create an identity they can live with . " Crafting a positive sense of self at work is more challenging when one 's work is considered " dirty " by societal standards " ( Tracy & Scott 2006 , p. 7 ) . " In other words , doing taint management is not just about allowing the employee to feel good in that job . " If employees must navigate discourses that question the viability of their work , and/ or experience obstacles in managing taint through transforming dirty work into a badge of honor , it is likely they will find blaming the client to be an efficacious route in affirming their identity " ( Tracy & Scott 2006 , p. 33 ) .
Concerns were raised over whether Levi 's Stadium 's field was of a high enough quality to host a Super Bowl ; during the inaugural season , the field had to be re-sodded multiple times due to various issues , and during a week 6 game earlier in the 2015 season , a portion of the turf collapsed under Baltimore Ravens kicker Justin Tucker , causing him to slip and miss a field goal , although the field has not had any major issues since . As is customary for Super Bowl games played at natural grass stadiums , the NFL re-sodded the field with a new playing surface ; a hybrid Bermuda 419 turf . NFL and Atlanta Braves field director Ed Mangan stated that the field was in " great shape " for gameday . However , the turf showed problem throughout the game , with a number of players needing to change their cleats during the game and player slipping during plays all throughout the game .
In addition , there are $ 2 million worth of other ancillary events , including a week-long event at the Santa Clara Convention Center , a beer , wine and food festival at Bellomy Field at Santa Clara University , and a pep rally . A professional fundraiser will aid in finding business sponsors and individual donors , but still may need the city council to help fund the event . Additional funding will be provided by the city council , which has announced plans to set aside seed funding for the event .
On the island of Crete , along with the lyra and the laouto ( lute ) , the mandolin is one of the main instruments used in Cretan Music . It appeared on Crete around the time of the Venetian rule of the island . Different variants of the mandolin , such as the " mantola , " were used to accompany the lyra , the violin , and the laouto . Stelios Foustalierakis reported that the mandolin and the mpoulgari were used to accompany the lyra in the beginning of the 20th century in the city of Rethimno . There are also reports that the mandolin was mostly a woman 's musical instrument . Nowadays it is played mainly as a solo instrument in personal and family events on the Ionian islands and Crete .
By 1987 , CBS was the only " big three " American TV network to have a co-owned record company . ABC had sold its record division to MCA Records in 1979 , and in 1986 , NBC 's parent company RCA was sold to General Electric , who then sold off all other RCA units , including the record division ( which was bought by Ariola Records , later known as BMG ) .
In late November 2015 , reports surfaced stating that " multiple acts " would perform during the halftime show . On December 3 , the league confirmed that the show would be headlined by the British rock group Coldplay . On January 7 , 2016 , Pepsi confirmed to the Associated Press that Beyoncé , who headlined the Super Bowl XLVII halftime show and collaborated with Coldplay on the single " Hymn for the Weekend " , would be making an appearance . Bruno Mars , who headlined the Super Bowl XLVIII halftime show , and Mark Ronson also performed .
The expansion of mandolin use continued after World War II through the late 1960s , and Japan still maintains a strong classical music tradition using mandolins , with active orchestras and university music programs . New orchestras were founded and new orchestral compositions composed . Japanese mandolin orchestras today may consist of up to 40 or 50 members , and can include woodwind , percussion , and brass sections . Japan also maintains an extensive collection of 20th Century mandolin music from Europe and one of the most complete collections of mandolin magazines from mandolin 's golden age , purchased by Morishige Takei .
Hard rock developed into a major form of popular music in the 1970s , with bands such as Led Zeppelin , The Who , Deep Purple , Aerosmith , AC/DC and Van Halen . During the 1980s , some hard rock bands moved away from their hard rock roots and more towards pop rock , while others began to return to a hard rock sound . Established bands made a comeback in the mid-1980s and it reached a commercial peak in the 1980s , with glam metal bands like Bon Jovi and Def Leppard and the rawer sounds of Guns N ' Roses , which followed up with great success in the later part of that decade . Hard rock began losing popularity with the commercial success of grunge and later Britpop in the 1990s .
Prior to the Golden Age of Mandolins , France had a history with the mandolin , with mandolinists playing in Paris until the Napoleonic Wars . The players , teachers and composers included Giovanni Fouchetti , Eduardo Mezzacapo , Gabriele Leon , and Gervasio . During the Golden age itself ( 1880s-1920s ) , the mandolin had a strong presence in France . Prominent mandolin players or composers included Jules Cottin and his sister Madeleine Cottin , Jean Pietrapertosa , and Edgar Bara . Paris had dozens of " estudiantina " mandolin orchestras in the early 1900s . Mandolin magazines included L'Estudiantina , Le Plectre , École de la mandolie .
The United Nations Population Fund ( UNFPA ) , formerly the United Nations Fund for Population Activities , is a UN organization . The UNFPA says it " is the lead UN agency for delivering a world where every pregnancy is wanted , every childbirth is safe and every young person 's potential is fulfilled . " Their work involves the improvement of reproductive health ; including creation of national strategies and protocols , and providing supplies and services . The organization has recently been known for its worldwide campaign against obstetric fistula and female genital mutilation .
The roots of hard rock can be traced back to the 1950s , particularly electric blues , which laid the foundations for key elements such as a rough declamatory vocal style , heavy guitar riffs , string-bending blues-scale guitar solos , strong beat , thick riff-laden texture , and posturing performances . Electric blues guitarists began experimenting with hard rock elements such as driving rhythms , distorted guitar solos and power chords in the 1950s , evident in the work of Memphis blues guitarists such as Joe Hill Louis , Willie Johnson , and particularly Pat Hare , who captured a " grittier , nastier , more ferocious electric guitar sound " on records such as James Cotton 's " Cotton Crop Blues " ( 1954 ) . Other antecedents include Link Wray 's instrumental " Rumble " in 1958 , and the surf rock instrumentals of Dick Dale , such as " Let 's Go Trippin ' " ( 1961 ) and " Misirlou " ( 1962 ) .
Six-time Grammy winner and Academy Award nominee Lady Gaga performed the national anthem , while Academy Award winner Marlee Matlin provided American Sign Language ( ASL ) translation .
A pair of overlapping political perspectives arising toward the end of the 20th century are republicanism ( or neo- or civic-republicanism ) and the capability approach . The resurgent republican movement aims to provide an alternate definition of liberty from Isaiah Berlin 's positive and negative forms of liberty , namely " liberty as non-domination . " Unlike liberals who understand liberty as " non-interference , " " non-domination " entails individuals not being subject to the arbitrary will of anyother person . To a liberal , a slave who is not interfered with may be free , yet to a republican the mere status as a slave , regardless of how that slave is treated , is objectionable . Prominent republicans include historian Quentin Skinner , jurist Cass Sunstein , and political philosopher Philip Pettit . The capability approach , pioneered by economists Mahbub ul Haq and Amartya Sen and further developed by legal scholar Martha Nussbaum , understands freedom under allied lines : the real-world ability to act . Both the capability approach and republicanism treat choice as something which must be resourced . In other words , it is not enough to be legally able to do something , but to have the real option of doing it .
Zinc is a chemical element with symbol Zn and atomic number 30 . It is the first element of group 12 of the periodic table . In some respects zinc is chemically similar to magnesium : its ion is of similar size and its only common oxidation state is +2 . Zinc is the 24th most abundant element in Earth 's crust and has five stable isotopes . The most common zinc ore is sphalerite ( zinc blende ) , a zinc sulfide mineral . The largest mineable amounts are found in Australia , Asia , and the United States . Zinc production includes froth flotation of the ore , roasting , and final extraction using electricity ( electrowinning ) .
Luther 's hymns were included in early Lutheran hymnals and spread the ideas of the Reformation . He supplied four of eight songs of the First Lutheran hymnal Achtliederbuch , 18 of 26 songs of the Erfurt Enchiridion , and 24 of the 32 songs in the first choral hymnal with settings by Johann Walter , Eyn geystlich Gesangk Buchleyn , all published in 1524 .

Coptic Christians face discrimination at multiple levels of the government , ranging from disproportionate representation in government ministries to laws that limit their ability to build or repair churches . Intolerance of Bahá'ís and non-orthodox Muslim sects , such as Sufis , Shi'a and Ahmadis , also remains a problem . When the government moved to computerise identification cards , members of religious minorities , such as Bahá'ís , could not obtain identification documents . An Egyptian court ruled in early 2008 that members of other faiths may obtain identity cards without listing their faiths , and without becoming officially recognised .
The tradition holds that Virgil was born in the village of Andes , near Mantua in Cisalpine Gaul . Analysis of his name has led to beliefs that he descended from earlier Roman colonists . Modern speculation ultimately is not supported by narrative evidence either from his own writings or his later biographers . Macrobius says that Virgil 's father was of a humble background ; however , scholars generally believe that Virgil was from an equestrian landowning family which could afford to give him an education . He attended schools in Cremona , Mediolanum , Rome and Naples . After considering briefly a career in rhetoric and law , the young Virgil turned his talents to poetry .
Westwood One will carry the game throughout North America , with Kevin Harlan as play-by-play announcer , Boomer Esiason and Dan Fouts as color analysts , and James Lofton and Mark Malone as sideline reporters . Jim Gray will anchor the pre-game and halftime coverage .
The annual NFL Experience was held at the Moscone Center in San Francisco . In addition , " Super Bowl City " opened on January 30 at Justin Herman Plaza on The Embarcadero , featuring games and activities that will highlight the Bay Area 's technology , culinary creations , and cultural diversity . More than 1 million people are expected to attend the festivities in San Francisco during Super Bowl Week . San Francisco mayor Ed Lee said of the highly visible homeless presence in this area " they are going to have to leave " . San Francisco city supervisor Jane Kim unsuccessfully lobbied for the NFL to reimburse San Francisco for city services in the amount of $ 5 million .
Luther secretly returned to Wittenberg on 6 March 1522 . He wrote to the Elector : " During my absence , Satan has entered my sheepfold , and committed ravages which I can not repair by writing , but only by my personal presence and living word . " For eight days in Lent , beginning on Invocavit Sunday , 9 March , Luther preached eight sermons , which became known as the " Invocavit Sermons " . In these sermons , he hammered home the primacy of core Christian values such as love , patience , charity , and freedom , and reminded the citizens to trust God 's word rather than violence to bring about necessary change .
Columbia founded Epic Records in 1953 . In 1956 , Conkling left Columbia , he would help establish the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences before eventually becoming the first president of the newly launched Warner Bros. Records , and Goddard Lieberson began the first of two stints as head of the record company . In 1958 , Columbia founded another label , Date Records , which initially issued rockabilly music .
The game 's media day , which was typically held on the Tuesday afternoon prior to the game , was moved to the Monday evening and re-branded as Super Bowl Opening Night . The event was held on February 1 , 2016 at SAP Center in San Jose . Alongside the traditional media availabilities , the event featured an opening ceremony with player introductions on a replica of the Golden Gate Bridge .
The biographical tradition asserts that Virgil began the hexameter Eclogues ( or Bucolics ) in 42 BC and it is thought that the collection was published around 39–38 BC , although this is controversial . The Eclogues ( from the Greek for " selections " ) are a group of ten poems roughly modeled on the bucolic hexameter poetry ( " pastoral poetry " ) of the Hellenistic poet Theocritus . After his victory in the Battle of Philippi in 42 BC , fought against the army led by the assassins of Julius Caesar , Octavian tried to pay off his veterans with land expropriated from towns in northern Italy , supposedly including , according to the tradition , an estate near Mantua belonging to Virgil . The loss of his family farm and the attempt through poetic petitions to regain his property have traditionally been seen as Virgil 's motives in the composition of the Eclogues . This is now thought to be an unsupported inference from interpretations of the Eclogues . In Eclogues 1 and 9 , Virgil indeed dramatizes the contrasting feelings caused by the brutality of the land expropriations through pastoral idiom , but offers no indisputable evidence of the supposed biographic incident . While some readers have identified the poet himself with various characters and their vicissitudes , whether gratitude by an old rustic to a new god ( Ecl . 1 ) , frustrated love by a rustic singer for a distant boy ( his master 's pet , Ecl . 2 ) , or a master singer 's claim to have composed several eclogues ( Ecl . 5 ) , modern scholars largely reject such efforts to garner biographical details from works of fiction , preferring to interpret an author 's characters and themes as illustrations of contemporary life and thought . The ten Eclogues present traditional pastoral themes with a fresh perspective . Eclogues 1 and 9 address the land confiscations and their effects on the Italian countryside . 2 and 3 are pastoral and erotic , discussing both homosexual love ( Ecl . 2 ) and attraction toward people of any gender ( Ecl . 3 ) . Eclogue 4 , addressed to Asinius Pollio , the so-called " Messianic Eclogue " uses the imagery of the golden age in connection with the birth of a child ( who the child was meant to be has been subject to debate ) . 5 and 8 describe the myth of Daphnis in a song contest , 6 , the cosmic and mythological song of Silenus ; 7 , a heated poetic contest , and 10 the sufferings of the contemporary elegiac poet Cornelius Gallus . Virgil is credited [ by whom ? ] in the Eclogues with establishing Arcadia as a poetic ideal that still resonates in Western literature and visual arts and setting the stage for the development of Latin pastoral by Calpurnius Siculus , Nemesianus , and later writers .
Hard rock entered the 1990s as one of the dominant forms of commercial music . The multi-platinum releases of AC/DC 's The Razors Edge ( 1990 ) , Guns N ' Roses ' Use Your Illusion I and Use Your Illusion II ( both in 1991 ) , Ozzy Osbourne 's No More Tears ( 1991 ) , and Van Halen 's For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge ( 1991 ) showcased this popularity . Additionally , The Black Crowes released their debut album , Shake Your Money Maker ( 1990 ) , which contained a bluesy classic rock sound and sold five million copies . In 1992 , Def Leppard followed up 1987 's Hysteria with Adrenalize , which went multi-platinum , spawned four Top 40 singles and held the number one spot on the US album chart for five weeks .
Six-time Grammy winner and Academy Award nominee Lady Gaga performed the national anthem , while Academy Award winner Marlee Matlin provided American Sign Language ( ASL ) translation .
Alloys of primarily zinc with small amounts of copper , aluminium , and magnesium are useful in die casting as well as spin casting , especially in the automotive , electrical , and hardware industries . These alloys are marketed under the name Zamak . An example of this is zinc aluminium . The low melting point together with the low viscosity of the alloy makes the production of small and intricate shapes possible . The low working temperature leads to rapid cooling of the cast products and therefore fast assembly is possible . Another alloy , marketed under the brand name Prestal , contains 78 % zinc and 22 % aluminium and is reported to be nearly as strong as steel but as malleable as plastic . This superplasticity of the alloy allows it to be molded using die casts made of ceramics and cement .
In addition , there are $ 2 million worth of other ancillary events , including a week-long event at the Santa Clara Convention Center , a beer , wine and food festival at Bellomy Field at Santa Clara University , and a pep rally . A professional fundraiser will aid in finding business sponsors and individual donors , but still may need the city council to help fund the event . Additional funding will be provided by the city council , which has announced plans to set aside seed funding for the event .
Blues rock acts that pioneered the sound included Cream , The Jimi Hendrix Experience , and The Jeff Beck Group . Cream , in songs like " I Feel Free " ( 1966 ) combined blues rock with pop and psychedelia , particularly in the riffs and guitar solos of Eric Clapton . Jimi Hendrix produced a form of blues-influenced psychedelic rock , which combined elements of jazz , blues and rock and roll . From 1967 Jeff Beck brought lead guitar to new heights of technical virtuosity and moved blues rock in the direction of heavy rock with his band , The Jeff Beck Group . Dave Davies of The Kinks , Keith Richards of The Rolling Stones , Pete Townshend of The Who , Hendrix , Clapton and Beck all pioneered the use of new guitar effects like phasing , feedback and distortion . The Beatles began producing songs in the new hard rock style beginning with the White Album in 1968 and , with the track " Helter Skelter " , attempted to create a greater level of noise than the Who . Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic has described the " proto-metal roar " of " Helter Skelter , " while Ian MacDonald argued that " their attempts at emulating the heavy style were without exception embarrassing . "
Afro-Spaniards are Spanish nationals of West/Central African descent . They today mainly come from Angola , Brazil , Cameroon , Cape Verde , Equatorial Guinea , Ghana , Gambia , Guinea-Bissau , Mali , Nigeria and Senegal . Additionally , many Afro-Spaniards born in Spain are from the former Spanish colony Equatorial Guinea . Today , there are an estimated 683,000 Afro-Spaniards in Spain .
Some established acts continued to enjoy commercial success , such as Aerosmith , with their number one multi-platinum albums : Get a Grip ( 1993 ) , which produced four Top 40 singles and became the band 's best-selling album worldwide ( going on to sell over 10 million copies ) , and Nine Lives ( 1997 ) . In 1998 , Aerosmith released the number one hit " I Do n't Want to Miss a Thing " , which remains the only single by a hard rock band to debut at number one . AC/DC produced the double platinum Ballbreaker ( 1995 ) . Bon Jovi appealed to their hard rock audience with songs such as " Keep the Faith " ( 1992 ) , but also achieved success in adult contemporary radio , with the Top 10 ballads " Bed of Roses " ( 1993 ) and " Always " ( 1994 ) . Bon Jovi 's 1995 album These Days was a bigger hit in Europe than it was in the United States , spawning four Top 10 singles on the UK Singles Chart . Metallica 's Load ( 1996 ) and ReLoad ( 1997 ) each sold in excess of 4 million copies in the US and saw the band develop a more melodic and blues rock sound . As the initial impetus of grunge bands faltered in the middle years of the decade , post-grunge bands emerged . They emulated the attitudes and music of grunge , particularly thick , distorted guitars , but with a more radio-friendly commercially oriented sound that drew more directly on traditional hard rock . Among the most successful acts were the Foo Fighters , Candlebox , Live , Collective Soul , Australia 's Silverchair and England 's Bush , who all cemented post-grunge as one of the most commercially viable subgenres by the late 1990s . Similarly , some post-Britpop bands that followed in the wake of Oasis , including Feeder and Stereophonics , adopted a hard rock or " pop-metal " sound .
One of the most influential works during this burgeoning period was Niccolò Machiavelli 's The Prince , written between 1511–12 and published in 1532 , after Machiavelli 's death . That work , as well as The Discourses , a rigorous analysis of the classical period , did much to influence modern political thought in the West . A minority ( including Jean-Jacques Rousseau ) interpreted The Prince as a satire meant to be given to the Medici after their recapture of Florence and their subsequent expulsion of Machiavelli from Florence . Though the work was written for the di Medici family in order to perhaps influence them to free him from exile , Machiavelli supported the Republic of Florence rather than the oligarchy of the di Medici family . At any rate , Machiavelli presents a pragmatic and somewhat consequentialist view of politics , whereby good and evil are mere means used to bring about an end—i.e. , the secure and powerful state . Thomas Hobbes , well known for his theory of the social contract , goes on to expand this view at the start of the 17th century during the English Renaissance . Although neither Machiavelli nor Hobbes believed in the divine right of kings , they both believed in the inherent selfishness of the individual . It was necessarily this belief that led them to adopt a strong central power as the only means of preventing the disintegration of the social order .
Despite his victory in Wittenberg , Luther was unable to stifle radicalism further afield . Preachers such as Zwickau prophet Nicholas Storch and Thomas Müntzer helped instigate the German Peasants ' War of 1524–25 , during which many atrocities were committed , often in Luther 's name . There had been revolts by the peasantry on a smaller scale since the 15th century . Luther 's pamphlets against the Church and the hierarchy , often worded with " liberal " phraseology , now led many peasants to believe he would support an attack on the upper classes in general . Revolts broke out in Franconia , Swabia , and Thuringia in 1524 , even drawing support from disaffected nobles , many of whom were in debt . Gaining momentum under the leadership of radicals such as Müntzer in Thuringia and Michael Gaismair in Tyrol , the revolts turned into war .
Luther refused to recant his writings . He is sometimes also quoted as saying : " Here I stand . I can do no other " . Recent scholars consider the evidence for these words to be unreliable , since they were inserted before " May God help me " only in later versions of the speech and not recorded in witness accounts of the proceedings . However , Mullett suggests that given his nature , " we are free to believe that Luther would tend to select the more dramatic form of words . "
Luther 's 1541 hymn " Christ unser Herr zum Jordan kam " ( " To Jordan came the Christ our Lord " ) reflects the structure and substance of his questions and answers concerning baptism in the Small Catechism . Luther adopted a preexisting Johann Walter tune associated with a hymnic setting of Psalm 67 's prayer for grace ; Wolf Heintz 's four-part setting of the hymn was used to introduce the Lutheran Reformation in Halle in 1541 . Preachers and composers of the 18th century , including J. S. Bach , used this rich hymn as a subject for their own work , although its objective baptismal theology was displaced by more subjective hymns under the influence of late-19th-century Lutheran pietism .
In late November 2015 , reports surfaced stating that " multiple acts " would perform during the halftime show . On December 3 , the league confirmed that the show would be headlined by the British rock group Coldplay . On January 7 , 2016 , Pepsi confirmed to the Associated Press that Beyoncé , who headlined the Super Bowl XLVII halftime show and collaborated with Coldplay on the single " Hymn for the Weekend " , would be making an appearance . Bruno Mars , who headlined the Super Bowl XLVIII halftime show , and Mark Ronson also performed .
Due to the patriarchal nature of Arab society , Arab men , including during the slave trade in North Africa , enslaved more black women than men . They used more black female slaves in domestic service and agriculture than males . The men interpreted the Qur'an to permit sexual relations between a male master and his female slave outside of marriage ( see Ma malakat aymanukum and sex ) , leading to many mixed-race children . When an enslaved woman became pregnant with her Arab master 's child , she was considered as umm walad or " mother of a child " , a status that granted her privileged rights . The child was given rights of inheritance to the father 's property , so mixed-race children could share in any wealth of the father . Because the society was patrilineal , the children took their fathers ' social status at birth and were born free .
Symptoms of mild zinc deficiency are diverse . Clinical outcomes include depressed growth , diarrhea , impotence and delayed sexual maturation , alopecia , eye and skin lesions , impaired appetite , altered cognition , impaired host defense properties , defects in carbohydrate utilization , and reproductive teratogenesis . Mild zinc deficiency depresses immunity , although excessive zinc does also . Animals with a diet deficient in zinc require twice as much food in order to attain the same weight gain as animals given sufficient zinc .
Contemporary Eastern Orthodox Christians often object to the dogmatic declaration of her immaculate conception as an " over-elaboration " of the faith and because they see it as too closely connected with a particular interpretation of the doctrine of ancestral sin . All the same , the historical and authentic tradition of Mariology in Byzantium took its historical point of departure from Sophronios , Damascene , and their imitators . The most famous Eastern Orthodox theologian to imply Mary 's Immaculate Conception was St. Gregory Palamas . Though many passages from his works were long known to extol and attribute to Mary a Christlike holiness in her human nature , traditional objections to Palamas ' disposition toward the Immaculate Conception typically rely on a poor understanding of his doctrine of " the purification of Mary " at the Annunciation . Not only did he explicitly cite St. Gregory Nazianzen for his understanding of Jesus ' purification at His baptism and Mary 's at the Annunciation , but Theophanes of Nicaea , Joseph Bryennius , and Gennadios Scholarios all explicitly placed Mary 's Conception as the first moment of her all-immaculate participation in the divine energies to such a degree that she was always completely without spot and graced . In addition to Emperor Manuel II and Gennadius Scholarius , St. Mark of Ephesus also fervently defended Mary 's title as " prepurified " against the Dominican , Manuel Calecas , who was perhaps promoting thomistic Mariology that denied Mary 's all-holiness from the first moment of her existence .
Luther next set about reversing or modifying the new church practices . By working alongside the authorities to restore public order , he signalled his reinvention as a conservative force within the Reformation . After banishing the Zwickau prophets , he now faced a battle against not only the established Church but also the radical reformers who threatened the new order by fomenting social unrest and violence .
Sony renamed the record company Sony Music Entertainment ( SME ) on January 1 , 1991 , fulfilling the terms set under the 1988 buyout , which granted only a transitional license to the CBS trademark . The CBS Associated label was renamed Epic Associated . Also on January 1 , 1991 , to replace the CBS label , Sony reintroduced the Columbia label worldwide , which it previously held in the United States and Canada only , after it acquired the international rights to the trademark from EMI in 1990 . Japan is the only country where Sony does not have rights to the Columbia name as it is controlled by Nippon Columbia , an unrelated company . Thus , until this day , Sony Music Entertainment Japan does not use the Columbia trademark for Columbia label recordings from outside Japan which are issued in Japan . The Columbia Records trademark 's rightsholder in Spain was Bertelsmann Music Group , Germany , which Sony Music subsequently subsumed via a 2004 merger , followed by a 2008 buyout .
The Suez Canal is an artificial sea-level waterway in Egypt considered the most important centre of the maritime transport in the Middle East , connecting the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea . Opened in November 1869 after 10 years of construction work , it allows ship transport between Europe and Asia without navigation around Africa . The northern terminus is Port Said and the southern terminus is Port Tawfiq at the city of Suez . Ismailia lies on its west bank , 3 km ( 1.9 mi ) from the half-way point .
Cardinal bishops ( cardinals of the episcopal order ) are among the most senior prelates of the Catholic Church . Though in modern times most cardinals are also bishops , the term " cardinal bishop " only refers to the cardinals who are titular bishops of one of the " suburbicarian " sees .
The Panthers beat the Seattle Seahawks in the divisional round , running up a 31–0 halftime lead and then holding off a furious second half comeback attempt to win 31–24 , avenging their elimination from a year earlier . The Panthers then blew out the Arizona Cardinals in the NFC Championship Game , 49–15 , racking up 487 yards and forcing seven turnovers .
The Roman Missal and the Roman Rite Liturgy of the Hours naturally includes references to Mary 's immaculate conception in the feast of the Immaculate Conception . An example is the antiphon that begins : " Tota pulchra es , Maria , et macula originalis non est in te " ( You are all beautiful , Mary , and the original stain [ of sin ] is not in you . Your clothing is white as snow , and your face is like the sun . You are all beautiful , Mary , and the original stain [ of sin ] is not in you . You are the glory of Jerusalem , you are the joy of Israel , you give honour to our people . You are all beautiful , Mary . ) On the basis of the original Gregorian chant music , polyphonic settings have been composed by Anton Bruckner , Pablo Casals , Maurice Duruflé , Grzegorz Gerwazy Gorczycki , no : Ola Gjeilo , José Maurício Nunes Garcia , and Nikolaus Schapfl ,
In the 18th century , the Moroccan Sultan Moulay Ismail " the Bloodthirsty " ( 1672–1727 ) raised a corps of 150,000 black slaves , called his Black Guard , who coerced the country into submission .
Egypt has a wide range of beaches situated on the Mediterranean and the Red Sea that extend to over 3,000 km . The Red Sea has serene waters , coloured coral reefs , rare fish and beautiful mountains . The Akba Gulf beaches also provide facilities for practising sea sports . Safaga tops the Red Sea zone with its beautiful location on the Suez Gulf . Last but not least , Sharm el-Sheikh ( or City of Peace ) , Hurghada , Luxor ( known as world 's greatest open-air museum/ or City of the ⅓ of world monuments ) , Dahab , Ras Sidr , Marsa Alam , Safaga and the northern coast of the Mediterranean are major tourist 's destinations of the recreational tourism .
Due to the often political and cultural contours of blackness in the United States , the notion of blackness can also be extended to non-black people . Toni Morrison once described Bill Clinton as the first black President of the United States , because , as she put it , he displayed " almost every trope of blackness " . Christopher Hitchens was offended by the notion of Clinton as the first black president , noting , " Mr Clinton , according to Toni Morrison , the Nobel Prize-winning novelist , is our first black President , the first to come from the broken home , the alcoholic mother , the under-the-bridge shadows of our ranking systems . Thus , we may have lost the mystical power to divine diabolism , but we can still divine blackness by the following symptoms : broken homes , alcoholic mothers , under-the-bridge habits and ( presumable from the rest of [ Arthur ] Miller 's senescent musings ) the tendency to sexual predation and to shameless perjury about same . " Some black activists were also offended , claiming that Clinton used his knowledge of black culture to exploit black people for political gain as no other president had before , while not serving black interests . They cite the lack of action during the Rwandan Genocide and his welfare reform , which Larry Roberts said had led to the worst child poverty since the 1960s . Others cited that the number of black people in jail increased during his administration .
In March 1968 , CBS and Sony formed CBS/Sony Records , a Japanese business joint venture . With Sony being one of the developers behind the compact disc digital music media , a compact disc production plant was constructed in Japan under the joint venture , allowing CBS to begin supplying some of the first compact disc releases for the American market in 1983 .
After each team punted , Panthers quarterback Cam Newton appeared to complete a 24-yard pass Jerricho Cotchery , but the call was ruled an incompletion and upheld after a replay challenge . CBS analyst and retired referee Mike Carey stated he disagreed with the call and felt the review clearly showed the pass was complete . A few plays later , on 3rd-and-10 from the 15-yard line , linebacker Von Miller knocked the ball out of Newton 's hands while sacking him , and Malik Jackson recovered it in the end zone for a Broncos touchdown , giving the team a 10–0 lead . This was the first fumble return touchdown in a Super Bowl since Super Bowl XXVIII at the end of the 1993 season .
The Panthers seemed primed to score on their opening drive of the second half when Newton completed a 45-yard pass to Ted Ginn Jr. on the Denver 35-yard line on their second offensive play . But the Broncos defense halted the drive on the 26-yard line , and it ended with no points when Graham Gano hit the uprights on a 44-yard field goal attempt . After the miss , Manning completed a pair of passes to Emmanuel Sanders for gains of 25 and 22 yards , setting up McManus ' 33-yard field goal that gave the Broncos a 16–7 lead . Carolina got off to another strong start after the kickoff , with Newton completing a 42-yard pass to Corey Brown . But once again they came up empty , this time as a result of a Newton pass that bounced off the hands of Ginn and was intercepted by safety T. J . Ward . Ward fumbled the ball during the return , but Trevathan recovered it to enable Denver to keep possession .
The flagship stations of each station in the markets of each team will carry their local play-by-play calls .

The roots of hard rock can be traced back to the 1950s , particularly electric blues , which laid the foundations for key elements such as a rough declamatory vocal style , heavy guitar riffs , string-bending blues-scale guitar solos , strong beat , thick riff-laden texture , and posturing performances . Electric blues guitarists began experimenting with hard rock elements such as driving rhythms , distorted guitar solos and power chords in the 1950s , evident in the work of Memphis blues guitarists such as Joe Hill Louis , Willie Johnson , and particularly Pat Hare , who captured a " grittier , nastier , more ferocious electric guitar sound " on records such as James Cotton 's " Cotton Crop Blues " ( 1954 ) . Other antecedents include Link Wray 's instrumental " Rumble " in 1958 , and the surf rock instrumentals of Dick Dale , such as " Let 's Go Trippin ' " ( 1961 ) and " Misirlou " ( 1962 ) .
By the 1900s , nigger had become a pejorative word in the United States . In its stead , the term colored became the mainstream alternative to negro and its derived terms . After the African-American Civil rights movement , the terms colored and negro gave way to " black " . Negro had superseded colored as the most polite word for African Americans at a time when black was considered more offensive . This term was accepted as normal , including by people classified as Negroes , until the later Civil Rights movement in the late 1960s . One well-known example is the identification by Reverend Martin Luther King , Jr. of his own race as " Negro " in his famous speech of 1963 , I Have a Dream . During the American Civil Rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s , some African-American leaders in the United States , notably Malcolm X , objected to the word Negro because they associated it with the long history of slavery , segregation , and discrimination that treated African Americans as second-class citizens , or worse . Malcolm X preferred Black to Negro , but later gradually abandoned that as well for Afro-American after leaving the Nation of Islam .
Some scholars , such as Mark U. Edwards in his book Luther 's Last Battles : Politics and Polemics 1531–46 ( 1983 ) , suggest that since Luther 's increasingly antisemitic views developed during the years his health deteriorated , it is possible they were at least partly the product of a declining state of mind . Edwards also comments that Luther often deliberately used " vulgarity and violence " for effect , both in his writings condemning the Jews and in diatribes against " Turks " ( Muslims ) and Catholics .
64Zn , the most abundant isotope of zinc , is very susceptible to neutron activation , being transmuted into the highly radioactive 65Zn , which has a half-life of 244 days and produces intense gamma radiation . Because of this , Zinc Oxide used in nuclear reactors as an anti-corrosion agent is depleted of 64Zn before use , this is called depleted zinc oxide . For the same reason , zinc has been proposed as a salting material for nuclear weapons ( cobalt is another , better-known salting material ) . A jacket of isotopically enriched 64Zn would be irradiated by the intense high-energy neutron flux from an exploding thermonuclear weapon , forming a large amount of 65Zn significantly increasing the radioactivity of the weapon 's fallout . Such a weapon is not known to have ever been built , tested , or used . 65Zn is also used as a tracer to study how alloys that contain zinc wear out , or the path and the role of zinc in organisms .
Much of mandolin development revolved around the soundboard ( the top ) . Pre-mandolin instruments were quiet instruments , strung with as many as six courses of gut strings , and were plucked with the fingers or with a quill . However , modern instruments are louder—using four courses of metal strings , which exert more pressure than the gut strings . The modern soundboard is designed to withstand the pressure of metal strings that would break earlier instruments . The soundboard comes in many shapes—but generally round or teardrop-shaped , sometimes with scrolls or other projections . There is usually one or more sound holes in the soundboard , either round , oval , or shaped like a calligraphic F ( f-hole ) . A round or oval sound hole may be covered or bordered with decorative rosettes or purfling .
Manning finished the year with a career-low 67.9 passer rating , throwing for 2,249 yards and nine touchdowns , with 17 interceptions .

Veteran receiver Demaryius Thomas led the team with 105 receptions for 1,304 yards and six touchdowns , while Emmanuel Sanders caught 76 passes for 1,135 yards and six scores , while adding another 106 yards returning punts . Tight end Owen Daniels was also a big element of the passing game with 46 receptions for 517 yards . Running back C. J. Anderson was the team 's leading rusher 863 yards and seven touchdowns , while also catching 25 passes for 183 yards . Running back Ronnie Hillman also made a big impact with 720 yards , five touchdowns , 24 receptions , and a 4.7 yards per carry average . Overall , the offense ranked 19th in scoring with 355 points and did not have any Pro Bowl selections .
While BSkyB had been excluded from being a part of the ONdigital consortium , thereby making them a competitor by default , BSkyB was able to join ITV Digital 's free-to-air replacement , Freeview , in which it holds an equal stake with the BBC , ITV , Channel 4 and National Grid Wireless . Prior to October 2005 , three BSkyB channels were available on this platform : Sky News , Sky Three , and Sky Sports News . Initially BSkyB provided Sky Travel to the service . However , this was replaced by Sky Three on 31 October 2005 , which was itself later re-branded as 'Pick TV ' in 2011 .
In contrast to the views of John Calvin and Philipp Melanchthon , throughout his life Luther maintained that it was not false doctrine to believe that a Christian 's soul sleeps after it is separated from the body in death ; and , accordingly , he disputed traditional interpretations of some Bible passages , such as the parable of the rich man and Lazarus . This also led Luther to reject the idea of torments for the saints : " It is enough for us to know that souls do not leave their bodies to be threatened by the torments and punishments of hell , but enter a prepared bedchamber in which they sleep in peace . " He also rejected the existence of Purgatory , which involved Christian souls undergoing penitential suffering after death . He affirmed the continuity of one 's personal identity beyond death . In his Smalcald Articles , he described the saints as currently residing " in their graves and in heaven . "
In 1507 , he was ordained to the priesthood , and in 1508 , von Staupitz , first dean of the newly founded University of Wittenberg , sent for Luther , to teach theology . He received a bachelor 's degree in Biblical studies on 9 March 1508 , and another bachelor 's degree in the Sentences by Peter Lombard in 1509 .
Beginning with the Paris Exposition of 1878 , the instrument 's popularity rebounded . The Exposition was one of many stops for a popular new performing group the Estudiantes Españoles ( Spanish Students ) . They danced and played guitars , violins and the bandurria , which became confused with the mandolin . Along with the energy and awareness created by the day 's hit sensation , a wave of Italian mandolinists travelled Europe in the 1880s and 1890s and in the United States by the mid-1880s , playing and teaching their instrument . The instrument 's popularity continued to increase during the 1890s and mandolin popularity was at its height in " early years of the 20th century . " Thousands were taking up the instrument as a pastime , and it became an instrument of society , taken up by young men and women . Mandolin orchestras were formed worldwide , incorporating not only the mandolin family of instruments , but also guitars , double basses and zithers .
Various gold-themed promotions and initiatives were held throughout the 2015 NFL season to tie into the " Golden Super Bowl " ; gold-tinted logos were implemented across the NFL 's properties and painted on fields , the numbering of the 50-yard line on fields was colored gold , and beginning on week 7 , all sideline jackets and hats featured gold-trimmed logos . Gold footballs were given to each high school that has had a player or coach appear in the Super Bowl , and " homecoming " events were also held by Super Bowl-winning teams at games .
Although Foo Fighters continued to be one of the most successful rock acts , with albums like In Your Honor ( 2005 ) reaching number two in the US and UK , many of the first wave of post-grunge bands began to fade in popularity . Acts like Creed , Staind , Puddle of Mudd and Nickelback took the genre into the 2000s with considerable commercial success , abandoning most of the angst and anger of the original movement for more conventional anthems , narratives and romantic songs . They were followed in this vein by new acts including Shinedown and Seether . Acts with more conventional hard rock sounds included Andrew W.K. , Beautiful Creatures and Buckcherry , whose breakthrough album 15 ( 2006 ) went platinum and spawned the single " Sorry " ( 2007 ) , which made the Top 10 of the Billboard 100 . These were joined by bands with hard rock leanings that emerged in the mid-2000s from the garage rock or post punk revival , including Black Rebel Motorcycle Club and Kings of Leon , and Queens of the Stone Age from the US , Three Days Grace from Canada , Jet from Australia and The Datsuns from New Zealand . In 2009 Them Crooked Vultures , a supergroup that brought together Foo Fighters ' Dave Grohl , Queens of the Stone Age 's Josh Homme and Led Zeppelin bass player John Paul Jones attracted attention as a live act and released a self-titled debut album that reached the top 20 in the US and UK and the top ten in several other countries .
QuickBooks sponsored a " Small Business Big Game " contest , in which Death Wish Coffee had a 30-second commercial aired free of charge courtesy of QuickBooks . Death Wish Coffee beat out nine other contenders from across the United States for the free advertisement .
The House of Representatives , whose members are elected to serve five-year terms , specialises in legislation . Elections were last held between November 2011 and January 2012 which was later dissolved . The next parliamentary election will be held within 6 months of the constitution 's ratification on 18 January 2014 . Originally , the parliament was to be formed before the president was elected , but interim president Adly Mansour pushed the date . The Egyptian presidential election , 2014 , took place on 26–28 May 2014 . Official figures showed a turnout of 25,578,233 or 47.5 % , with Abdel Fattah el-Sisi winning with 23.78 million votes , or 96.91 % compared to 757,511 ( 3.09 % ) for Hamdeen Sabahi .
Archbishop Albrecht of Mainz and Magdeburg did not reply to Luther 's letter containing the 95 Theses . He had the theses checked for heresy and in December 1517 forwarded them to Rome . He needed the revenue from the indulgences to pay off a papal dispensation for his tenure of more than one bishopric . As Luther later noted , " the pope had a finger in the pie as well , because one half was to go to the building of St Peter 's Church in Rome " .
Luther had been suffering from ill health for years , including Ménière 's disease , vertigo , fainting , tinnitus , and a cataract in one eye . From 1531 to 1546 , his health deteriorated further . The years of struggle with Rome , the antagonisms with and among his fellow reformers , and the scandal which ensued from the bigamy of the Philip of Hesse incident , in which Luther had played a leading role , all may have contributed . In 1536 , he began to suffer from kidney and bladder stones , and arthritis , and an ear infection ruptured an ear drum . In December 1544 , he began to feel the effects of angina .
Luther made his pronouncements from Wartburg in the context of rapid developments at Wittenberg , of which he was kept fully informed . Andreas Karlstadt , supported by the ex-Augustinian Gabriel Zwilling , embarked on a radical programme of reform there in June 1521 , exceeding anything envisaged by Luther . The reforms provoked disturbances , including a revolt by the Augustinian friars against their prior , the smashing of statues and images in churches , and denunciations of the magistracy . After secretly visiting Wittenberg in early December 1521 , Luther wrote A Sincere Admonition by Martin Luther to All Christians to Guard Against Insurrection and Rebellion . Wittenberg became even more volatile after Christmas when a band of visionary zealots , the so-called Zwickau prophets , arrived , preaching revolutionary doctrines such as the equality of man , adult baptism , and Christ 's imminent return . When the town council asked Luther to return , he decided it was his duty to act .
The catechism is one of Luther 's most personal works . " Regarding the plan to collect my writings in volumes , " he wrote , " I am quite cool and not at all eager about it because , roused by a Saturnian hunger , I would rather see them all devoured . For I acknowledge none of them to be really a book of mine , except perhaps the Bondage of the Will and the Catechism . " The Small Catechism has earned a reputation as a model of clear religious teaching . It remains in use today , along with Luther 's hymns and his translation of the Bible .
The Panthers offense , which led the NFL in scoring ( 500 points ) , was loaded with talent , boasting six Pro Bowl selections . Pro Bowl quarterback Cam Newton had one of his best seasons , throwing for 3,837 yards and rushing for 636 , while recording a career-high and league-leading 45 total touchdowns ( 35 passing , 10 rushing ) , a career-low 10 interceptions , and a career-best quarterback rating of 99.4 . Newton 's leading receivers were tight end Greg Olsen , who caught a career-high 77 passes for 1,104 yards and seven touchdowns , and wide receiver Ted Ginn , Jr. , who caught 44 passes for 739 yards and 10 touchdowns ; Ginn also rushed for 60 yards and returned 27 punts for 277 yards . Other key receivers included veteran Jerricho Cotchery ( 39 receptions for 485 yards ) , rookie Devin Funchess ( 31 receptions for 473 yards and five touchdowns ) , and second-year receiver Corey Brown ( 31 receptions for 447 yards ) . The Panthers backfield featured Pro Bowl running back Jonathan Stewart , who led the team with 989 rushing yards and six touchdowns in 13 games , along with Pro Bowl fullback Mike Tolbert , who rushed for 256 yards and caught 18 passes for another 154 yards . Carolina 's offensive line also featured two Pro Bowl selections : center Ryan Kalil and guard Trai Turner .
Egyptian cinema became a regional force with the coming of sound . In 1936 , Studio Misr , financed by industrialist Talaat Harb , emerged as the leading Egyptian studio , a role the company retained for three decades . For over 100 years , more than 4000 films have been produced in Egypt , three quarters of the total Arab production . [ citation needed ] Egypt is considered the leading country in the field of cinema in the Middle East . Actors from all over the Arab World seek to appear in the Egyptian cinema for the sake of fame . The Cairo International Film Festival has been rated as one of 11 festivals with a top class rating worldwide by the International Federation of Film Producers ' Associations .
As a result of modernisation efforts over the years , Egypt 's healthcare system has made great strides forward . Access to healthcare in both urban and rural areas greatly improved and immunisation programs are now able to cover 98 % of the population . Life expectancy increased from 44.8 years during the 1960s to 72.12 years in 2009 . There was a noticeable decline of the infant mortality rate ( during the 1970s to the 1980s the infant mortality rate was 101-132/1000 live births , in 2000 the rate was 50-60/1000 , and in 2008 it was 28-30/1000 ) .
Other sources include fortified food and dietary supplements , which come in various forms . A 1998 review concluded that zinc oxide , one of the most common supplements in the United States , and zinc carbonate are nearly insoluble and poorly absorbed in the body . This review cited studies which found low plasma zinc concentrations after zinc oxide and zinc carbonate were consumed compared with those seen after consumption of zinc acetate and sulfate salts . However , harmful excessive supplementation is a problem among the relatively affluent , and should probably not exceed 20 mg/day in healthy people , although the U.S. National Research Council set a Tolerable Upper Intake of 40 mg/day .
The game 's media day , which was typically held on the Tuesday afternoon prior to the game , was moved to the Monday evening and re-branded as Super Bowl Opening Night . The event was held on February 1 , 2016 at SAP Center in San Jose . Alongside the traditional media availabilities , the event featured an opening ceremony with player introductions on a replica of the Golden Gate Bridge .
In 1978 Aboriginal writer Kevin Gilbert received the National Book Council award for his book Living Black : Blacks Talk to Kevin Gilbert , a collection of Aboriginal people 's stories , and in 1998 was awarded ( but refused to accept ) the Human Rights Award for Literature for Inside Black Australia , a poetry anthology and exhibition of Aboriginal photography . In contrast to previous definitions based solely on the degree of Aboriginal ancestry , in 1990 the Government changed the legal definition of Aboriginal to include any :
Westwood One will carry the game throughout North America , with Kevin Harlan as play-by-play announcer , Boomer Esiason and Dan Fouts as color analysts , and James Lofton and Mark Malone as sideline reporters . Jim Gray will anchor the pre-game and halftime coverage .
According to the Office for National Statistics , at the 2001 census there were over a million black people in the United Kingdom ; 1 % of the total population described themselves as " Black Caribbean " , 0.8 % as " Black African " , and 0.2 % as " Black other " . Britain encouraged the immigration of workers from the Caribbean after World War II ; the first symbolic movement was those who came on the ship the Empire Windrush . The preferred official umbrella term is " black and minority ethnic " ( BME ) , but sometimes the term " black " is used on its own , to express unified opposition to racism , as in the Southall Black Sisters , which started with a mainly British Asian constituency , and the National Black Police Association , which has a membership of " African , African-Caribbean and Asian origin " .
Virgin Media ( re-branded in 2007 from NTL : Telewest ) started to offer a high-definition television ( HDTV ) capable set top box , although from 30 November 2006 until 30 July 2009 it only carried one linear HD channel , BBC HD , after the conclusion of the ITV HD trial . Virgin Media has claimed that other HD channels were " locked up " or otherwise withheld from their platform , although Virgin Media did in fact have an option to carry Channel 4 HD in the future . Nonetheless , the linear channels were not offered , Virgin Media instead concentrating on its Video On Demand service to carry a modest selection of HD content . Virgin Media has nevertheless made a number of statements over the years , suggesting that more linear HD channels are on the way .
On August 5 , 2008 , SCA and Bertelsmann announced that Sony had agreed to acquire Bertelsmann 's 50 % stake in Sony BMG . Sony completed its acquisition of Bertelsmann 's 50 % stake in the companies ' joint venture on October 1 , 2008 . The company , once again named Sony Music Entertainment Inc. , became a wholly owned subsidiary of Sony Corporation through its US subsidiary SCA . The last few albums to feature a Sony BMG logo were Thriller 25 by Michael Jackson , I Am ... Sasha Fierce by Beyoncé , Keeps Gettin ' Better : A Decade of Hits by Christina Aguilera , and Safe Trip Home by Dido . A temporary logo was unveiled beginning December 1 , 2008 . The present logo was unveiled in March 2009 .
Martin Luther , who initiated the Protestant Reformation , said : " Mother Mary , like us , was born in sin of sinful parents , but the Holy Spirit covered her , sanctified and purified her so that this child was born of flesh and blood , but not with sinful flesh and blood . The Holy Spirit permitted the Virgin Mary to remain a true , natural human being of flesh and blood , just as we . However , he warded off sin from her flesh and blood so that she became the mother of a pure child , not poisoned by sin as we are . For in that moment when she conceived , she was a holy mother filled with the Holy Spirit and her fruit is a holy pure fruit , at once God and truly man , in one person . " Some Lutherans , such as the members of the Anglo-Lutheran Catholic Church , support the doctrine .
While the cardinalate has long been expanded beyond the Roman pastoral clergy and Roman Curia , every cardinal priest has a titular church in Rome , though they may be bishops or archbishops elsewhere , just as cardinal bishops are given one of the suburbicarian dioceses around Rome . Pope Paul VI abolished all administrative rights cardinals had with regard to their titular churches , though the cardinal 's name and coat of arms are still posted in the church , and they are expected to celebrate mass and preach there if convenient when they are in Rome .

In 1982 , the US Mint began minting pennies coated in copper but made primarily of zinc . With the new zinc pennies , there is the potential for zinc toxicosis , which can be fatal . One reported case of chronic ingestion of 425 pennies ( over 1 kg of zinc ) resulted in death due to gastrointestinal bacterial and fungal sepsis , whereas another patient , who ingested 12 grams of zinc , only showed lethargy and ataxia ( gross lack of coordination of muscle movements ) . Several other cases have been reported of humans suffering zinc intoxication by the ingestion of zinc coins .
Following their loss in the divisional round of the previous season 's playoffs , the Denver Broncos underwent numerous coaching changes , including a mutual parting with head coach John Fox ( who had won four divisional championships in his four years as Broncos head coach ) , and the hiring of Gary Kubiak as the new head coach . Under Kubiak , the Broncos planned to install a run-oriented offense with zone blocking to blend in with quarterback Peyton Manning 's shotgun passing skills , but struggled with numerous changes and injuries to the offensive line , as well as Manning having his worst statistical season since his rookie year with the Indianapolis Colts in 1998 , due to a plantar fasciitis injury in his heel that he had suffered since the summer , and the simple fact that Manning was getting old , as he turned 39 in the 2015 off-season . Although the team had a 7–0 start , Manning led the NFL in interceptions . In week 10 , Manning suffered a partial tear of the plantar fasciitis in his left foot . He set the NFL 's all-time record for career passing yards in this game , but was benched after throwing four interceptions in favor of backup quarterback Brock Osweiler , who took over as the starter for most of the remainder of the regular season . Osweiler was injured , however , leading to Manning 's return during the Week 17 regular season finale , where the Broncos were losing 13–7 against the 4–11 San Diego Chargers , resulting in Manning re-claiming the starting quarterback position for the playoffs by leading the team to a key 27–20 win that enabled the team to clinch the number one overall AFC seed . Under defensive coordinator Wade Phillips , the Broncos ' defense ranked number one in total yards allowed , passing yards allowed and sacks , and like the previous three seasons , the team has continued to set numerous individual , league and franchise records . With the defense carrying the team despite the issues with the offense , the Broncos finished the regular season with a 12–4 record and earned home-field advantage throughout the AFC playoffs .
In 2007 , BSkyB and Virgin Media became involved in a dispute over the carriage of Sky channels on cable TV . The failure to renew the existing carriage agreements negotiated with NTL and Telewest resulted in Virgin Media removing the basic channels from the network on 1 March 2007 . Virgin Media claimed that BSkyB had substantially increased the asking price for the channels , a claim which BSkyB denied , on the basis that their new deal offered " substantially more value " by including HD channels and Video On Demand content which was not previously carried by cable .
With 4:51 left in regulation , Carolina got the ball on their own 24-yard line with a chance to mount a game-winning drive , and soon faced 3rd-and-9 . On the next play , Miller stripped the ball away from Newton , and after several players dove for it , it took a long bounce backwards and was recovered by Ward , who returned it five yards to the Panthers 4-yard line . Although several players dove into the pile to attempt to recover it , Newton did not and his lack of aggression later earned him heavy criticism . Meanwhile , Denver 's offense was kept out of the end zone for three plays , but a holding penalty on cornerback Josh Norman gave the Broncos a new set of downs . Then Anderson scored on a 2-yard touchdown run and Manning completed a pass to Bennie Fowler for a 2-point conversion , giving Denver a 24–10 lead with 3:08 left and essentially putting the game away . Carolina had two more drives , but failed to get a first down on each one .
It was not until January 1518 that friends of Luther translated the 95 Theses from Latin into German and printed and widely copied them , making the controversy one of the first in history to be aided by the printing press . Within two weeks , copies of the theses had spread throughout Germany ; within two months , they had spread throughout Europe .
The mandolin 's popularity in the United States was spurred by the success of a group of touring young European musicians known as the Estudiantina Figaro , or in the United States , simply the " Spanish Students . " The group landed in the U.S. on January 2 , 1880 in New York City , and played in Boston and New York to wildly enthusiastic crowds . Ironically , this ensemble did not play mandolins but rather bandurrias , which are also small , double-strung instruments that resemble the mandolin . The success of the Figaro Spanish Students spawned other groups who imitated their musical style and costumes . An Italian musician , Carlo Curti , hastily started a musical ensemble after seeing the Figaro Spanish Students perform ; his group of Italian born Americans called themselves the " Original Spanish Students , " counting on the American public to not know the difference between the Spanish bandurrias and Italian mandolins . The imitators ' use of mandolins helped to generate enormous public interest in an instrument previously relatively unknown in the United States .
Pope Sixtus V limited the number of cardinals to 70 , comprising six cardinal bishops , 50 cardinal priests , and 14 cardinal deacons . Starting in the pontificate of Pope John XXIII , that limit has been exceeded . At the start of 1971 , Pope Paul VI set the number of cardinal electors at a maximum of 120 , but set no limit on the number of cardinals generally . He also established a maximum age of eighty years for electors . His action deprived twenty-five living cardinals , including the three living cardinals elevated by Pope Pius XI , of the right to participate in a conclave . [ citation needed ] Popes can dispense from church laws and have sometimes brought the number of cardinals under the age of 80 to more than 120 . Pope Paul VI also increased the number of cardinal bishops by giving that rank to patriarchs of the Eastern Catholic Churches .
As of 2000 [ update ] , children and teenagers ( 0–19 years old ) make up 15.1 % of the population , while adults ( 20–64 years old ) make up 65 % and seniors ( over 64 years old ) make up 19.9 % .
QuickBooks sponsored a " Small Business Big Game " contest , in which Death Wish Coffee had a 30-second commercial aired free of charge courtesy of QuickBooks . Death Wish Coffee beat out nine other contenders from across the United States for the free advertisement .
The relative reactivity of zinc and its ability to attract oxidation to itself makes it an efficient sacrificial anode in cathodic protection ( CP ) . For example , cathodic protection of a buried pipeline can be achieved by connecting anodes made from zinc to the pipe . Zinc acts as the anode ( negative terminus ) by slowly corroding away as it passes electric current to the steel pipeline . [ note 2 ] Zinc is also used to cathodically protect metals that are exposed to sea water from corrosion . A zinc disc attached to a ship 's iron rudder will slowly corrode , whereas the rudder stays unattacked . Other similar uses include a plug of zinc attached to a propeller or the metal protective guard for the keel of the ship .
CBS set the base rate for a 30-second advertisement at $ 5,000,000 , a record high price for a Super Bowl ad . As of January 26 , the advertisements had not yet sold out . CBS mandated that all advertisers purchase a package covering time on both the television and digital broadcasts of the game , meaning that for the first time , digital streams of the game would carry all national advertising in pattern with the television broadcast . This would be the final year in a multi-year contract with Anheuser-Busch InBev that allowed the beer manufacturer to air multiple advertisements during the game at a steep discount . It was also the final year that Doritos , a longtime sponsor of the game , held its " Crash the Super Bowl " contest that allowed viewers to create their own Doritos ads for a chance to have it aired during the game . Nintendo and The Pokémon Company also made their Super Bowl debut , promoting the 20th anniversary of the Pokémon video game and media franchise .
The etymology of the name Bern is uncertain . According to the local legend , based on folk etymology , Berchtold V , Duke of Zähringen , the founder of the city of Bern , vowed to name the city after the first animal he met on the hunt , and this turned out to be a bear . It has long been considered likely that the city was named after the Italian city of Verona , which at the time was known as Bern in Middle High German . As a result of the find of the Bern zinc tablet in the 1980s , it is now more common to assume that the city was named after a pre-existing toponym of Celtic origin , possibly *berna " cleft " . The bear was the heraldic animal of the seal and coat of arms of Bern from at least the 1220s . The earliest reference to the keeping of live bears in the Bärengraben dates to the 1440s .
Antonio Vivaldi composed a mandolin concerto ( Concerto in C major Op.3 6 ) and two concertos for two mandolins and orchestra . Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart placed it in his 1787 work Don Giovanni and Beethoven created four variations of it . Antonio Maria Bononcini composed La conquista delle Spagne di Scipione Africano il giovane in 1707 and George Frideric Handel composed Alexander Balus in 1748 . Others include Giovani Battista Gervasio ( Sonata in D major for Mandolin and Basso Continuo ) , Giuseppe Giuliano ( Sonata in D major for Mandolin and Basso Continuo ) , Emanuele Barbella ( Sonata in D major for Mandolin and Basso Continuo ) , Domenico Scarlatti ( Sonata n.54 ( K.89 ) in D minor for Mandolin and Basso Continuo ) , and Addiego Guerra ( Sonata in G major for Mandolin and Basso Continuo ) .
As of 2000 [ update ] , there were 59,948 people who were single and never married in the municipality . There were 49,873 married individuals , 9,345 widows or widowers and 9,468 individuals who are divorced .
After each team punted , Panthers quarterback Cam Newton appeared to complete a 24-yard pass Jerricho Cotchery , but the call was ruled an incompletion and upheld after a replay challenge . CBS analyst and retired referee Mike Carey stated he disagreed with the call and felt the review clearly showed the pass was complete . A few plays later , on 3rd-and-10 from the 15-yard line , linebacker Von Miller knocked the ball out of Newton 's hands while sacking him , and Malik Jackson recovered it in the end zone for a Broncos touchdown , giving the team a 10–0 lead . This was the first fumble return touchdown in a Super Bowl since Super Bowl XXVIII at the end of the 1993 season .
When Cowan Powers and his family recorded their old-time music from 1924-1926 , his daughter Orpha Powers was one of the earliest known southern-music artists to record with the mandolin . By the 1930s , single mandolins were becoming more commonly used in southern string band music , most notably by brother duets such as the sedate Blue Sky Boys ( Bill Bolick and Earl Bolick ) and the more hard-driving Monroe Brothers ( Bill Monroe and Charlie Monroe ) . However , the mandolin 's modern popularity in country music can be directly traced to one man : Bill Monroe , the father of bluegrass music . After the Monroe Brothers broke up in 1939 , Bill Monroe formed his own group , after a brief time called the Blue Grass Boys , and completed the transition of mandolin styles from a " parlor " sound typical of brother duets to the modern " bluegrass " style . He joined the Grand Ole Opry in 1939 and its powerful clear-channel broadcast signal on WSM-AM spread his style throughout the South , directly inspiring many musicians to take up the mandolin . Monroe famously played Gibson F-5 mandolin , signed and dated July 9 , 1923 , by Lloyd Loar , chief acoustic engineer at Gibson . The F-5 has since become the most imitated tonally and aesthetically by modern builders .
Despite his victory in Wittenberg , Luther was unable to stifle radicalism further afield . Preachers such as Zwickau prophet Nicholas Storch and Thomas Müntzer helped instigate the German Peasants ' War of 1524–25 , during which many atrocities were committed , often in Luther 's name . There had been revolts by the peasantry on a smaller scale since the 15th century . Luther 's pamphlets against the Church and the hierarchy , often worded with " liberal " phraseology , now led many peasants to believe he would support an attack on the upper classes in general . Revolts broke out in Franconia , Swabia , and Thuringia in 1524 , even drawing support from disaffected nobles , many of whom were in debt . Gaining momentum under the leadership of radicals such as Müntzer in Thuringia and Michael Gaismair in Tyrol , the revolts turned into war .
Beginning several centuries ago , during the period of the Ottoman Empire , tens of thousands of Black Africans were brought by slave traders to plantations and agricultural areas situated between Antalya and Istanbul in present-day Turkey . Some of their descendants remained in situ , and many migrated to larger cities and towns . Other blacks slaves were transported to Crete , from where they or their descendants later reached the İzmir area through the population exchange between Greece and Turkey in 1923 , or indirectly from Ayvalık in pursuit of work .
The transition from the mandolino to the mandolin began around 1744 with the designing of the metal-string mandolin by the Vinaccia family , 3 brass strings and one of gut , using friction tuning pegs on a fingerboard that sat " flush " with the sound table . The mandolin grew in popularity over the next 60 years , in the streets where it was used by young men courting and by street musicians , and in the concert hall . After the Napoleonic Wars of 1815 , however , its popularity began to fall . The 19th century produced some prominent players , including Bartolomeo Bortolazzi of Venice and Pietro Vimercati . However , professional virtuosity was in decline , and the mandolin music changed as the mandolin became a folk instrument ; " the large repertoire of notated instrumental music for the mandolino and the mandoline was completely forgotten " . The export market for mandolins from Italy dried up around 1815 , and when Carmine de Laurentiis wrote a mandolin method in 1874 , the Music World magazine wrote that the mandolin was " out of date . " Salvador Léonardi mentioned this decline in his 1921 book , Méthode pour Banjoline ou Mandoline-Banjo , saying that the mandolin had been declining in popularity from previous times .
John Locke in particular exemplified this new age of political theory with his work Two Treatises of Government . In it Locke proposes a state of nature theory that directly complements his conception of how political development occurs and how it can be founded through contractual obligation . Locke stood to refute Sir Robert Filmer 's paternally founded political theory in favor of a natural system based on nature in a particular given system . The theory of the divine right of kings became a passing fancy , exposed to the type of ridicule with which John Locke treated it . Unlike Machiavelli and Hobbes but like Aquinas , Locke would accept Aristotle 's dictum that man seeks to be happy in a state of social harmony as a social animal . Unlike Aquinas 's preponderant view on the salvation of the soul from original sin , Locke believes man 's mind comes into this world as tabula rasa . For Locke , knowledge is neither innate , revealed nor based on authority but subject to uncertainty tempered by reason , tolerance and moderation . According to Locke , an absolute ruler as proposed by Hobbes is unnecessary , for natural law is based on reason and seeking peace and survival for man .
The Siddi are an ethnic group inhabiting India and Pakistan whose members are descended from Bantu peoples from Southeast Africa that were brought to the Indian subcontinent as slaves by Arab and Portuguese merchants . Although it is commonly believed locally that " Siddi " derives from a word meaning " black " , the term is actually derived from " Sayyid " , the title borne by the captains of the Arab vessels that first brought Siddi settlers to the area . In the Makran strip of the Sindh and Balochistan provinces in southwestern Pakistan , these Bantu descendants are known as the Makrani . There was a brief " Black Power " movement in Sindh in the 1960s and many Siddi are proud of and celebrate their African ancestry .
In the summer of 1521 , Luther widened his target from individual pieties like indulgences and pilgrimages to doctrines at the heart of Church practices . In On the Abrogation of the Private Mass , he condemned as idolatry the idea that the mass is a sacrifice , asserting instead that it is a gift , to be received with thanksgiving by the whole congregation . His essay On Confession , Whether the Pope has the Power to Require It rejected compulsory confession and encouraged private confession and absolution , since " every Christian is a confessor . " In November , Luther wrote The Judgement of Martin Luther on Monastic Vows . He assured monks and nuns that they could break their vows without sin , because vows were an illegitimate and vain attempt to win salvation .
There is confusion currently as to the name of the eldest Vinaccia luthier who first ran the shop . His name has been put forth as Gennaro Vinaccia ( active c. 1710 to c. 1788 ) and Nic . Vinaccia . His son Antonio Vinaccia was active c. 1734 to c. 1796 . An early extant example of a mandolin is one built by Antonio Vinaccia in 1759 , which resides at the University of Edinburgh . Another is by Giuseppe Vinaccia , built in 1893 , is also at the University of Edinburgh . The earliest extant mandolin was built in 1744 by Antonio 's son , Gaetano Vinaccia . It resides in the Conservatoire Royal de Musique in Brussels , Belgium .
By the 2000 census , demographic changes including the end to slavery , immigration from Europe and Asia , assimilation of multiracial persons , and other factors resulted in a population in which 6.2 % of the population identified as black , 40 % as pardo , and 55 % as white . Essentially most of the black population was absorbed into the multi-racial category by intermixing . A 2007 genetic study found that at least 29 % of the middle-class , white Brazilian population had some recent ( since 1822 and the end of the colonial period ) African ancestry .

Some scholars have asserted that Luther taught that faith and reason were antithetical in the sense that questions of faith could not be illuminated by reason . He wrote , " All the articles of our Christian faith , which God has revealed to us in His Word , are in presence of reason sheerly impossible , absurd , and false . " and " [ That ] Reason in no way contributes to faith . [ ... ] For reason is the greatest enemy that faith has ; it never comes to the aid of spiritual things . " However , though seemingly contradictorily , he also wrote in the latter work that human reason " strives not against faith , when enlightened , but rather furthers and advances it " , bringing claims he was a fideist into dispute . Contemporary Lutheran scholarship , however , has found a different reality in Luther . Luther rather seeks to separate faith and reason in order to honor the separate spheres of knowledge that each applies to . Bernhard Lohse , for example , has demonstrated in his classic work " Fides und Ratio " that Luther ultimately sought to put the two together . More recently , Hans-Peter Grosshans has demonstrated that Luther 's work on Biblical Criticism stresses the need for external coherence in the right exegetical method . This means that for Luther it is more important that the Bible is reasonable according to the reality outside of the scriptures than that the Bible makes sense to itself , that it has internal coherence . The right tool for understanding the world outside of the Bible for Luther is none other than reason , which for him is the field of science , philosophy , history and empirical observation . Here a different picture is presented of a Luther who deeply valued both faith and reason , and held them in dialectical partnership . Luther 's concern thus in separating them is honoring their different epistemological spheres .
The Panthers beat the Seattle Seahawks in the divisional round , running up a 31–0 halftime lead and then holding off a furious second half comeback attempt to win 31–24 , avenging their elimination from a year earlier . The Panthers then blew out the Arizona Cardinals in the NFC Championship Game , 49–15 , racking up 487 yards and forcing seven turnovers .
In early times , the privilege of papal election was not reserved to the cardinals , and for centuries the person elected was customarily a Roman priest and never a bishop from elsewhere . To preserve apostolic succession the rite of consecrating him a bishop had to be performed by someone who was already a bishop . The rule remains that , if the person elected Pope is not yet a bishop , he is consecrated by the Dean of the College of Cardinals , the Cardinal Bishop of Ostia .
The works of Virgil almost from the moment of their publication revolutionized Latin poetry . The Eclogues , Georgics , and above all the Aeneid became standard texts in school curricula with which all educated Romans were familiar . Poets following Virgil often refer intertextually to his works to generate meaning in their own poetry . The Augustan poet Ovid parodies the opening lines of the Aeneid in Amores 1.1.1–2 , and his summary of the Aeneas story in Book 14 of the Metamorphoses , the so-called " mini-Aeneid " , has been viewed as a particularly important example of post-Virgilian response to the epic genre . Lucan 's epic , the Bellum Civile has been considered an anti-Virgilian epic , disposing with the divine mechanism , treating historical events , and diverging drastically from Virgilian epic practice . The Flavian poet Statius in his 12-book epic Thebaid engages closely with the poetry of Virgil ; in his epilogue he advises his poem not to " rival the divine Aeneid , but follow afar and ever venerate its footsteps . " In Silius Italicus , Virgil finds one of his most ardent admirers . With almost every line of his epic Punica Silius references Virgil . Indeed , Silius is known to have bought Virgil 's tomb and worshipped the poet . Partially as a result of his so-called " Messianic " Fourth Eclogue—widely interpreted later to have predicted the birth of Jesus Christ—Virgil was in later antiquity imputed to have the magical abilities of a seer ; the Sortes Vergilianae , the process of using Virgil 's poetry as a tool of divination , is found in the time of Hadrian , and continued into the Middle Ages . In a similar vein Macrobius in the Saturnalia credits the work of Virgil as the embodiment of human knowledge and experience , mirroring the Greek conception of Homer . Virgil also found commentators in antiquity . Servius , a commentator of the 4th century AD , based his work on the commentary of Donatus . Servius ' commentary provides us with a great deal of information about Virgil 's life , sources , and references ; however , many modern scholars find the variable quality of his work and the often simplistic interpretations frustrating .
Egypt actively practices capital punishment . Egypt 's authorities do not release figures on death sentences and executions , despite repeated requests over the years by human rights organisations . The United Nations human rights office and various NGOs expressed " deep alarm " after an Egyptian Minya Criminal Court sentenced 529 people to death in a single hearing on 25 March 2014 . Sentenced supporters of former President Mohamed Morsi will be executed for their alleged role in violence following his ousting in July 2013 . The judgment was condemned as a violation of international law . By May 2014 , approximately 16,000 people ( and as high as more than 40,000 by one independent count ) , mostly Brotherhood members or supporters , have been imprisoned after the coup after the Muslim Brotherhood was labelled as terrorist organisation by the post-coup interim Egyptian government .
In the new commercial climate glam metal bands like Europe , Ratt , White Lion and Cinderella broke up , Whitesnake went on hiatus in 1991 , and while many of these bands would re-unite again in the late 1990s or early 2000s , they never reached the commercial success they saw in the 1980s or early 1990s . Other bands such as Mötley Crüe and Poison saw personnel changes which impacted those bands ' commercial viability during the decade . In 1995 Van Halen released Balance , a multi-platinum seller that would be the band 's last with Sammy Hagar on vocals . In 1996 David Lee Roth returned briefly and his replacement , former Extreme singer Gary Cherone , was fired soon after the release of the commercially unsuccessful 1998 album Van Halen III and Van Halen would not tour or record again until 2004 . Guns N ' Roses ' original lineup was whittled away throughout the decade . Drummer Steven Adler was fired in 1990 , guitarist Izzy Stradlin left in late 1991 after recording Use Your Illusion I and II with the band . Tensions between the other band members and lead singer Axl Rose continued after the release of the 1993 covers album The Spaghetti Incident ? Guitarist Slash left in 1996 , followed by bassist Duff McKagan in 1997 . Axl Rose , the only original member , worked with a constantly changing lineup in recording an album that would take over fifteen years to complete .
Luther justified his opposition to the rebels on three grounds . First , in choosing violence over lawful submission to the secular government , they were ignoring Christ 's counsel to " Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar 's " ; St. Paul had written in his epistle to the Romans 13:1–7 that all authorities are appointed by God and therefore should not be resisted . This reference from the Bible forms the foundation for the doctrine known as the Divine Right of Kings , or , in the German case , the divine right of the princes . Second , the violent actions of rebelling , robbing , and plundering placed the peasants " outside the law of God and Empire " , so they deserved " death in body and soul , if only as highwaymen and murderers . " Lastly , Luther charged the rebels with blasphemy for calling themselves " Christian brethren " and committing their sinful acts under the banner of the Gospel .
From the end of World War II until 1971 , when John Rawls published A Theory of Justice , political philosophy declined in the Anglo-American academic world , as analytic philosophers expressed skepticism about the possibility that normative judgments had cognitive content , and political science turned toward statistical methods and behavioralism . In continental Europe , on the other hand , the postwar decades saw a huge blossoming of political philosophy , with Marxism dominating the field . This was the time of Jean-Paul Sartre and Louis Althusser , and the victories of Mao Zedong in China and Fidel Castro in Cuba , as well as the events of May 1968 led to increased interest in revolutionary ideology , especially by the New Left . A number of continental European émigrés to Britain and the United States—including Karl Popper , Friedrich Hayek , Leo Strauss , Isaiah Berlin , Eric Voegelin and Judith Shklar—encouraged continued study in political philosophy in the Anglo-American world , but in the 1950s and 1960s they and their students remained at odds with the analytic establishment .
Peyton Manning became the first quarterback ever to lead two different teams to multiple Super Bowls . He is also the oldest quarterback ever to play in a Super Bowl at age 39 . The past record was held by John Elway , who led the Broncos to victory in Super Bowl XXXIII at age 38 and is currently Denver 's Executive Vice President of Football Operations and General Manager .
In early modern times , cardinals often had important roles in secular affairs . In some cases , they took on powerful positions in government . In Henry VIII 's England , his chief minister was Cardinal Wolsey . Cardinal Richelieu 's power was so great that he was for many years effectively the ruler of France . Richelieu successor was also a cardinal , Jules Mazarin . Guillaume Dubois and André-Hercule de Fleury complete the list of the " four great " cardinals to have ruled France . [ citation needed ] In Portugal , due to a succession crisis , one cardinal , Henry , King of Portugal , was crowned king , the only example of a cardinal-king .
BSkyB 's direct-to-home satellite service became available in 10 million homes in 2010 , Europe 's first pay-TV platform in to achieve that milestone . Confirming it had reached its target , the broadcaster said its reach into 36 % of households in the UK represented an audience of more than 25m people . The target was first announced in August 2004 , since then an additional 2.4m customers had subscribed to BSkyB 's direct-to-home service . Media commentators had debated whether the figure could be reached as the growth in subscriber numbers elsewhere in Europe flattened .
Virgin Media ( re-branded in 2007 from NTL : Telewest ) started to offer a high-definition television ( HDTV ) capable set top box , although from 30 November 2006 until 30 July 2009 it only carried one linear HD channel , BBC HD , after the conclusion of the ITV HD trial . Virgin Media has claimed that other HD channels were " locked up " or otherwise withheld from their platform , although Virgin Media did in fact have an option to carry Channel 4 HD in the future . Nonetheless , the linear channels were not offered , Virgin Media instead concentrating on its Video On Demand service to carry a modest selection of HD content . Virgin Media has nevertheless made a number of statements over the years , suggesting that more linear HD channels are on the way .
In the Middle Ages , Virgil 's reputation was such that it inspired legends associating him with magic and prophecy . From at least the 3rd century , Christian thinkers interpreted Eclogues 4 , which describes the birth of a boy ushering in a golden age , as a prediction of Jesus ' birth . As such , Virgil came to be seen on a similar level as the Hebrew prophets of the Bible as one who had heralded Christianity .
Genetic studies have found significant African female-mediated gene flow in Arab communities in the Arabian Peninsula and neighboring countries , with an average of 38 % of maternal lineages in Yemen are of direct African descent , 16 % in Oman-Qatar , and 10 % in Saudi Arabia-United Arab Emirates .
Cardinal deacons derive originally from the seven deacons in the Papal Household and the seven deacons who supervised the Church 's works in the districts of Rome during the early Middle Ages , when church administration was effectively the government of Rome and provided all social services . Cardinal deacons are given title to one of these deaconries .
On Carolina 's next possession fullback Mike Tolbert lost a fumble while being tackled by safety Darian Stewart , which linebacker Danny Trevathan recovered on the Broncos 40-yard line . However , the Panthers soon took the ball back when defensive end Kony Ealy tipped a Manning pass to himself and then intercepted it , returning the ball 19 yards to the Panthers 39-yard line with 1:55 left on the clock . The Panthers could not gain any yards with their possession and had to punt . After a Denver punt , Carolina drove to the Broncos 45-yard line . But with 11 seconds left , Newton was sacked by DeMarcus Ware as time expired in the half .
From 2002 through 2008 , the Bush Administration denied funding to UNFPA that had already been allocated by the US Congress , partly on the refuted claims that the UNFPA supported Chinese government programs which include forced abortions and coercive sterilizations . In a letter from the Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Nicholas Burns to Congress , the administration said it had determined that UNFPA ’ s support for China ’ s population program “ facilitates ( its ) government ’ s coercive abortion program ” , thus violating the Kemp-Kasten Amendment , which bans the use of United States aid to finance organizations that support or take part in managing a program of coercive abortion of sterilization .
The papal bull defining the dogma , Ineffabilis Deus , mentioned in particular the patrististic interpretation of Genesis 3:15 as referring to a woman , Mary , who would be eternally at enmity with the evil serpent and completely triumphing over him . It said the Fathers saw foreshadowings of Mary 's " wondrous abundance of divine gifts and original innocence " " in that ark of Noah , which was built by divine command and escaped entirely safe and sound from the common shipwreck of the whole world ; in the ladder which Jacob saw reaching from the earth to heaven , by whose rungs the angels of God ascended and descended , and on whose top the Lord himself leaned ; in that bush which Moses saw in the holy place burning on all sides , which was not consumed or injured in any way but grew green and blossomed beautifully ; in that impregnable tower before the enemy , from which hung a thousand bucklers and all the armor of the strong ; in that garden enclosed on all sides , which can not be violated or corrupted by any deceitful plots ; in that resplendent city of God , which has its foundations on the holy mountains ; in that most august temple of God , which , radiant with divine splendours , is full of the glory of God ; and in very many other biblical types of this kind . "
Also in late 1965 , the Date subsidiary label was revived . This label released the first string of hits for Peaches & Herb and scored a few minor hits from various other artists . Date 's biggest success was " Time of the Season " by the Zombies , peaking at # 2 in 1969 . The label was discontinued in 1970 .
Some consider koshari ( a mixture of rice , lentils , and macaroni ) to be the national dish . Fried onions can be also added to koshari . In addition , ful medames ( mashed fava beans ) is one of the most popular dishes . Fava bean is also used in making falafel ( also known as " ta'meyya " ) , which may have originated in Egypt and spread to other parts of the Middle East . Garlic fried with coriander is added to mulukhiyya , a popular green soup made from finely chopped jute leaves , sometimes with chicken or rabbit .
Instruments were marketed by teacher-dealers , much as the title character in the popular musical The Music Man . Often , these teacher-dealers conducted mandolin orchestras : groups of 4-50 musicians who played various mandolin family instruments . However , alongside the teacher-dealers were serious musicians , working to create a spot for the instrument in classical music , ragtime and jazz . Like the teacher-dealers , they traveled the U.S. , recording records , giving performances and teaching individuals and mandolin orchestras . Samuel Siegel played mandolin in Vaudeville and became one of America 's preeminent mandolinists . Seth Weeks was an African American who not only taught and performed in the United States , but also in Europe , where he recorded records . Another pioneering African American musician and director who made his start with a mandolin orchestra was composer James Reese Europe . W. Eugene Page toured the country with a group , and was well known for his mandolin and mandola performances . Other names include Valentine Abt , Samuel Adelstein , William Place , Jr. , and Aubrey Stauffer .
When Sky Digital was launched in 1998 the new service used the Astra 2A satellite which was located at the 28.5°E orbital position , unlike the analogue service which was broadcast from 19.2°E . This was subsequently followed by more Astra satellites as well as Eutelsat 's Eurobird 1 ( now Eutelsat 33C ) at 28.5°E ) , enabled the company to launch a new all-digital service , Sky , with the potential to carry hundreds of television and radio channels . The old position was shared with broadcasters from several European countries , while the new position at 28.5°E came to be used almost exclusively for channels that broadcast to the United Kingdom .
Possibly as early as the second century AD , Virgil 's works were seen as having magical properties and were used for divination . In what became known as the Sortes Vergilianae ( Virgilian Lots ) , passages would be selected at random and interpreted to answer questions . In the 12th century , starting around Naples but eventually spreading widely throughout Europe , a tradition developed in which Virgil was regarded as a great magician . Legends about Virgil and his magical powers remained popular for over two hundred years , arguably becoming as prominent as his writings themselves . Virgil 's legacy in medieval Wales was such that the Welsh version of his name , Fferyllt or Pheryllt , became a generic term for magic-worker , and survives in the modern Welsh word for pharmacist , fferyllydd .
UNFPA began operations in 1969 as the United Nations Fund for Population Activities ( the name was changed in 1987 ) under the administration of the United Nations Development Fund . In 1971 it was placed under the authority of the United Nations General Assembly .
The concept of race in Brazil is complex . A Brazilian child was never automatically identified with the racial type of one or both of his or her parents , nor were there only two categories to choose from . Between an individual of unmixed West African descent and a very light mulatto individual , more than a dozen racial categories were acknowledged , based on various combinations of hair color , hair texture , eye color , and skin color . These types grade into each other like the colors of the spectrum , and no one category stands significantly isolated from the rest . In Brazil , people are classified by appearance , not heredity .
Over the next five days , private conferences were held to determine Luther 's fate . The Emperor presented the final draft of the Edict of Worms on 25 May 1521 , declaring Luther an outlaw , banning his literature , and requiring his arrest : " We want him to be apprehended and punished as a notorious heretic . " It also made it a crime for anyone in Germany to give Luther food or shelter . It permitted anyone to kill Luther without legal consequence .
The enforcement of the ban on the 95 Theses fell to the secular authorities . On 18 April 1521 , Luther appeared as ordered before the Diet of Worms . This was a general assembly of the estates of the Holy Roman Empire that took place in Worms , a town on the Rhine . It was conducted from 28 January to 25 May 1521 , with Emperor Charles V presiding . Prince Frederick III , Elector of Saxony , obtained a safe conduct for Luther to and from the meeting .
It was not until January 1518 that friends of Luther translated the 95 Theses from Latin into German and printed and widely copied them , making the controversy one of the first in history to be aided by the printing press . Within two weeks , copies of the theses had spread throughout Germany ; within two months , they had spread throughout Europe .
William Champion 's brother , John , patented a process in 1758 for calcining zinc sulfide into an oxide usable in the retort process . Prior to this , only calamine could be used to produce zinc . In 1798 , Johann Christian Ruberg improved on the smelting process by building the first horizontal retort smelter . Jean-Jacques Daniel Dony built a different kind of horizontal zinc smelter in Belgium , which processed even more zinc . Italian doctor Luigi Galvani discovered in 1780 that connecting the spinal cord of a freshly dissected frog to an iron rail attached by a brass hook caused the frog 's leg to twitch . He incorrectly thought he had discovered an ability of nerves and muscles to create electricity and called the effect " animal electricity " . The galvanic cell and the process of galvanization were both named for Luigi Galvani and these discoveries paved the way for electrical batteries , galvanization and cathodic protection .
Concerns were raised over whether Levi 's Stadium 's field was of a high enough quality to host a Super Bowl ; during the inaugural season , the field had to be re-sodded multiple times due to various issues , and during a week 6 game earlier in the 2015 season , a portion of the turf collapsed under Baltimore Ravens kicker Justin Tucker , causing him to slip and miss a field goal , although the field has not had any major issues since . As is customary for Super Bowl games played at natural grass stadiums , the NFL re-sodded the field with a new playing surface ; a hybrid Bermuda 419 turf . NFL and Atlanta Braves field director Ed Mangan stated that the field was in " great shape " for gameday . However , the turf showed problem throughout the game , with a number of players needing to change their cleats during the game and player slipping during plays all throughout the game .
Following their loss in the divisional round of the previous season 's playoffs , the Denver Broncos underwent numerous coaching changes , including a mutual parting with head coach John Fox ( who had won four divisional championships in his four years as Broncos head coach ) , and the hiring of Gary Kubiak as the new head coach . Under Kubiak , the Broncos planned to install a run-oriented offense with zone blocking to blend in with quarterback Peyton Manning 's shotgun passing skills , but struggled with numerous changes and injuries to the offensive line , as well as Manning having his worst statistical season since his rookie year with the Indianapolis Colts in 1998 , due to a plantar fasciitis injury in his heel that he had suffered since the summer , and the simple fact that Manning was getting old , as he turned 39 in the 2015 off-season . Although the team had a 7–0 start , Manning led the NFL in interceptions . In week 10 , Manning suffered a partial tear of the plantar fasciitis in his left foot . He set the NFL 's all-time record for career passing yards in this game , but was benched after throwing four interceptions in favor of backup quarterback Brock Osweiler , who took over as the starter for most of the remainder of the regular season . Osweiler was injured , however , leading to Manning 's return during the Week 17 regular season finale , where the Broncos were losing 13–7 against the 4–11 San Diego Chargers , resulting in Manning re-claiming the starting quarterback position for the playoffs by leading the team to a key 27–20 win that enabled the team to clinch the number one overall AFC seed . Under defensive coordinator Wade Phillips , the Broncos ' defense ranked number one in total yards allowed , passing yards allowed and sacks , and like the previous three seasons , the team has continued to set numerous individual , league and franchise records . With the defense carrying the team despite the issues with the offense , the Broncos finished the regular season with a 12–4 record and earned home-field advantage throughout the AFC playoffs .
Some scholars , such as Mark U. Edwards in his book Luther 's Last Battles : Politics and Polemics 1531–46 ( 1983 ) , suggest that since Luther 's increasingly antisemitic views developed during the years his health deteriorated , it is possible they were at least partly the product of a declining state of mind . Edwards also comments that Luther often deliberately used " vulgarity and violence " for effect , both in his writings condemning the Jews and in diatribes against " Turks " ( Muslims ) and Catholics .
For fortification , however , a 2003 review recommended zinc oxide in cereals as cheap , stable , and as easily absorbed as more expensive forms . A 2005 study found that various compounds of zinc , including oxide and sulfate , did not show statistically significant differences in absorption when added as fortificants to maize tortillas . A 1987 study found that zinc picolinate was better absorbed than zinc gluconate or zinc citrate . However , a study published in 2008 determined that zinc glycinate is the best absorbed of the four dietary supplement types available .
The Broncos defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers in the divisional round , 23–16 , by scoring 11 points in the final three minutes of the game . They then beat the defending Super Bowl XLIX champion New England Patriots in the AFC Championship Game , 20–18 , by intercepting a pass on New England 's 2-point conversion attempt with 17 seconds left on the clock . Despite Manning 's problems with interceptions during the season , he did n't throw any in their two playoff games .
Contributions from governments and the private sector to UNFPA in 2014 exceeded $ 1 billion . The amount includes $ 477 million to the organization ’ s core resources and $ 529 million earmarked for specific programs and initiatives .
The Cardinal Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church , assisted by the Vice-Camerlengo and the other prelates of the office known as the Apostolic Camera , has functions that in essence are limited to a period of sede vacante of the papacy . He is to collate information about the financial situation of all administrations dependent on the Holy See and present the results to the College of Cardinals , as they gather for the papal conclave .
In this work , one of his most emphatic statements on faith , he argued that every good work designed to attract God 's favor is a sin . All humans are sinners by nature , he explained , and God 's grace ( which can not be earned ) alone can make them just . On 1 August 1521 , Luther wrote to Melanchthon on the same theme : " Be a sinner , and let your sins be strong , but let your trust in Christ be stronger , and rejoice in Christ who is the victor over sin , death , and the world . We will commit sins while we are here , for this life is not a place where justice resides . "
The House of Representatives , whose members are elected to serve five-year terms , specialises in legislation . Elections were last held between November 2011 and January 2012 which was later dissolved . The next parliamentary election will be held within 6 months of the constitution 's ratification on 18 January 2014 . Originally , the parliament was to be formed before the president was elected , but interim president Adly Mansour pushed the date . The Egyptian presidential election , 2014 , took place on 26–28 May 2014 . Official figures showed a turnout of 25,578,233 or 47.5 % , with Abdel Fattah el-Sisi winning with 23.78 million votes , or 96.91 % compared to 757,511 ( 3.09 % ) for Hamdeen Sabahi .
In 1630 , Pope Urban VIII decreed their title to be Eminence ( previously , it had been " illustrissimo " and " reverendissimo " ) and decreed that their secular rank would equate to Prince , making them secondary only to the Pope and crowned monarchs .
In the early 20th century several mandolin orchestras ( Estudiantinas ) were active in Belgium . Today only a few groups remain : Royal Estudiantina la Napolitaine ( founded in 1904 ) in Antwerp , Brasschaats mandoline orkest in Brasschaat and an orchestra in Mons ( Bergen ) . Gerda Abts is a well known mandolin virtuoso in Belgium . She is also mandolin teacher and gives lessons in the music academies of Lier , Wijnegem and Brasschaat . She is now also professor mandolin at the music high school “ Koninklijk Conservatorium Artesis Hogeschool Antwerpen ” . She also gives various concerts each year in different ensembles . She is in close contact to the Brasschaat mandolin Orchestra . Her site is www.gevoeligesnaar.be
On June 4 , 2014 , the NFL announced that the practice of branding Super Bowl games with Roman numerals , a practice established at Super Bowl V , would be temporarily suspended , and that the game would be named using Arabic numerals as Super Bowl 50 as opposed to Super Bowl L. The use of Roman numerals will be reinstated for Super Bowl LI . Jaime Weston , the league 's vice president of brand and creative , explained that a primary reason for the change was the difficulty of designing an aesthetically pleasing logo with the letter " L " using the standardized logo template introduced at Super Bowl XLV . The logo also deviates from the template by featuring large numerals , colored in gold , behind the Vince Lombardi Trophy , instead of underneath and in silver as in the standard logo .
The Panthers seemed primed to score on their opening drive of the second half when Newton completed a 45-yard pass to Ted Ginn Jr. on the Denver 35-yard line on their second offensive play . But the Broncos defense halted the drive on the 26-yard line , and it ended with no points when Graham Gano hit the uprights on a 44-yard field goal attempt . After the miss , Manning completed a pair of passes to Emmanuel Sanders for gains of 25 and 22 yards , setting up McManus ' 33-yard field goal that gave the Broncos a 16–7 lead . Carolina got off to another strong start after the kickoff , with Newton completing a 42-yard pass to Corey Brown . But once again they came up empty , this time as a result of a Newton pass that bounced off the hands of Ginn and was intercepted by safety T. J . Ward . Ward fumbled the ball during the return , but Trevathan recovered it to enable Denver to keep possession .
Approximately 12 million Africans were shipped to the Americas during the Atlantic slave trade from 1492 to 1888 , with 11.5 million of those shipped to South America and the Caribbean . Brazil was the largest importer in the Americas , with 5.5 million African slaves imported , followed by the British Caribbean with 2.76 million , the Spanish Caribbean and Spanish Mainland with 1.59 million Africans , and the French Caribbean with 1.32 million . Today their descendants number approximately 150 million in South America and the Caribbean . In addition to skin color , other physical characteristics such as facial features and hair texture are often variously used in classifying peoples as black in South America and the Caribbean . In South America and the Caribbean , classification as black is also closely tied to social status and socioeconomic variables , especially in light of social conceptions of " blanqueamiento " ( racial whitening ) and related concepts .
On Carolina 's next possession fullback Mike Tolbert lost a fumble while being tackled by safety Darian Stewart , which linebacker Danny Trevathan recovered on the Broncos 40-yard line . However , the Panthers soon took the ball back when defensive end Kony Ealy tipped a Manning pass to himself and then intercepted it , returning the ball 19 yards to the Panthers 39-yard line with 1:55 left on the clock . The Panthers could not gain any yards with their possession and had to punt . After a Denver punt , Carolina drove to the Broncos 45-yard line . But with 11 seconds left , Newton was sacked by DeMarcus Ware as time expired in the half .
On 19 October 1512 , he was awarded his Doctor of Theology and , on 21 October 1512 , was received into the senate of the theological faculty of the University of Wittenberg , having been called to the position of Doctor in Bible . He spent the rest of his career in this position at the University of Wittenberg .
After Morsi was ousted by the military , the judiciary system aligned itself with the new government , actively suopporting the repression of Muslim Brotherhood members . This resulted in a sharp increase in mass death sentences that arose criticism from the US president Barack Obama and the General Secretary of the UN , Ban Ki Moon . In April 2013 , one judge of the Minya governatorate of Upper Egypt , sentenced 1,212 people to death . In December 2014 the judge Mohammed Nagi Shahata , notorious for his fierceness in passing on death sentences , condemened to the capital penalty 188 members of the Muslim Brotherhood , for assaulting a police station . Various Egyptian and international human rights organisations have already pointed out the lack of fair trials , that often last only a few minutes and do not take into consideration the procedural standards of fair trials .
The instrument was primarily used in an ensemble setting well into the 1930s , and although the fad died out at the beginning of the 1930s , the instruments that were developed for the orchestra found a new home in bluegrass . The famous Lloyd Loar Master Model from Gibson ( 1923 ) was designed to boost the flagging interest in mandolin ensembles , with little success . However , The " Loar " became the defining instrument of bluegrass music when Bill Monroe purchased F-5 S/N 73987 in a Florida barbershop in 1943 and popularized it as his main instrument .
In 2008 , the High Court in South Africa ruled that Chinese South Africans who were residents during the apartheid era ( and their descendants ) are to be reclassified as " Black people , " solely for the purposes of accessing affirmative action benefits , because they were also " disadvantaged " by racial discrimination . Chinese people who arrived in the country after the end of apartheid do not qualify for such benefits .
The celebrated John Duns Scotus ( d. 1308 ) , a Friar Minor like Saint Bonaventure , argued , on the contrary , that from a rational point of view it was certainly as little derogatory to the merits of Christ to assert that Mary was by him preserved from all taint of sin , as to say that she first contracted it and then was delivered . Proposing a solution to the theological problem of reconciling the doctrine with that of universal redemption in Christ , he argued that Mary 's immaculate conception did not remove her from redemption by Christ ; rather it was the result of a more perfect redemption granted her because of her special role in salvation history .
Luther 's 1538 hymnic version of the Lord 's Prayer , " Vater unser im Himmelreich " , corresponds exactly to Luther 's explanation of the prayer in the Small Catechism , with one stanza for each of the seven prayer petitions , plus opening and closing stanzas . The hymn functioned both as a liturgical setting of the Lord 's Prayer and as a means of examining candidates on specific catechism questions . The extant manuscript shows multiple revisions , demonstrating Luther 's concern to clarify and strengthen the text and to provide an appropriately prayerful tune . Other 16th- and 20th-century versifications of the Lord 's Prayer have adopted Luther 's tune , although modern texts are considerably shorter .
Medieval political philosophy in Europe was heavily influenced by Christian thinking . It had much in common with the Mutazalite Islamic thinking in that the Roman Catholics though subordinating philosophy to theology did not subject reason to revelation but in the case of contradictions , subordinated reason to faith as the Asharite of Islam . The Scholastics by combining the philosophy of Aristotle with the Christianity of St. Augustine emphasized the potential harmony inherent in reason and revelation . Perhaps the most influential political philosopher of medieval Europe was St. Thomas Aquinas who helped reintroduce Aristotle 's works , which had only been transmitted to Catholic Europe through Muslim Spain , along with the commentaries of Averroes . Aquinas 's use of them set the agenda , for scholastic political philosophy dominated European thought for centuries even unto the Renaissance .
About 150,000 East African and black people live in Israel , amounting to just over 2 % of the nation 's population . The vast majority of these , some 120,000 , are Beta Israel , most of whom are recent immigrants who came during the 1980s and 1990s from Ethiopia . In addition , Israel is home to over 5,000 members of the African Hebrew Israelites of Jerusalem movement that are descendants of African Americans who emigrated to Israel in the 20th century , and who reside mainly in a distinct neighborhood in the Negev town of Dimona . Unknown numbers of black converts to Judaism reside in Israel , most of them converts from the United Kingdom , Canada , and the United States .
The cardinal who is the longest-serving member of the order of cardinal priests is titled cardinal protopriest . He had certain ceremonial duties in the conclave that have effectively ceased because he would generally have already reached age 80 , at which cardinals are barred from the conclave . The current cardinal protopriest is Paulo Evaristo Arns of Brazil .
Mandolin has also been used in blues music , most notably by Ry Cooder , who performed outstanding covers on his very first recordings , Yank Rachell , Johnny " Man " Young , Carl Martin , and Gerry Hundt . Howard Armstrong , who is famous for blues violin , got his start with his father 's mandolin and played in string bands similar to the other Tennessee string bands he came into contact with , with band makeup including " mandolins and fiddles and guitars and banjos . And once in a while they would ease a little ukulele in there and a bass fiddle . " Other blues players from the era 's string bands include Willie Black ( Whistler And His Jug Band ) , Dink Brister , Jim Hill , Charles Johnson , Coley Jones ( Dallas String Band ) , Bobby Leecan ( Need More Band ) , Alfred Martin , Charlie McCoy ( 1909-1950 ) , Al Miller , Matthew Prater , and Herb Quinn .
In the new commercial climate glam metal bands like Europe , Ratt , White Lion and Cinderella broke up , Whitesnake went on hiatus in 1991 , and while many of these bands would re-unite again in the late 1990s or early 2000s , they never reached the commercial success they saw in the 1980s or early 1990s . Other bands such as Mötley Crüe and Poison saw personnel changes which impacted those bands ' commercial viability during the decade . In 1995 Van Halen released Balance , a multi-platinum seller that would be the band 's last with Sammy Hagar on vocals . In 1996 David Lee Roth returned briefly and his replacement , former Extreme singer Gary Cherone , was fired soon after the release of the commercially unsuccessful 1998 album Van Halen III and Van Halen would not tour or record again until 2004 . Guns N ' Roses ' original lineup was whittled away throughout the decade . Drummer Steven Adler was fired in 1990 , guitarist Izzy Stradlin left in late 1991 after recording Use Your Illusion I and II with the band . Tensions between the other band members and lead singer Axl Rose continued after the release of the 1993 covers album The Spaghetti Incident ? Guitarist Slash left in 1996 , followed by bassist Duff McKagan in 1997 . Axl Rose , the only original member , worked with a constantly changing lineup in recording an album that would take over fifteen years to complete .
Luther 's hymns inspired composers to write music . Johann Sebastian Bach included several verses as chorales in his cantatas and based chorale cantatas entirely on them , namely Christ lag in Todes Banden , BWV 4 , as early as possibly 1707 , in his second annual cycle ( 1724 to 1725 ) Ach Gott , vom Himmel sieh darein , BWV 2 , Christ unser Herr zum Jordan kam , BWV 7 , Nun komm , der Heiden Heiland , BWV 62 , Gelobet seist du , Jesu Christ , BWV 91 , and Aus tiefer Not schrei ich zu dir , BWV 38 , later Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott , BWV 80 , and in 1735 Wär Gott nicht mit uns diese Zeit , BWV 14 .
In July 2012 , Ancestry.com reported on historic and DNA research by its staff that discovered that Obama is likely a descendant through his mother of John Punch , considered by some historians to be the first African slave in the Virginia colony . An indentured servant , he was " bound for life " in 1640 after trying to escape . The story of him and his descendants is that of multi-racial America since it appeared he and his sons married or had unions with white women , likely indentured servants and working-class like them . Their multi-racial children were free because they were born to free English women . Over time , Obama 's line of the Bunch family ( as they became known ) were property owners and continued to " marry white " ; they became part of white society , likely by the early to mid-18th century .
During the Western Schism , many cardinals were created by the contending popes . Beginning with the reign of Pope Martin V , cardinals were created without publishing their names until later , termed creati et reservati in pectore .
About 150,000 East African and black people live in Israel , amounting to just over 2 % of the nation 's population . The vast majority of these , some 120,000 , are Beta Israel , most of whom are recent immigrants who came during the 1980s and 1990s from Ethiopia . In addition , Israel is home to over 5,000 members of the African Hebrew Israelites of Jerusalem movement that are descendants of African Americans who emigrated to Israel in the 20th century , and who reside mainly in a distinct neighborhood in the Negev town of Dimona . Unknown numbers of black converts to Judaism reside in Israel , most of them converts from the United Kingdom , Canada , and the United States .
The official language of Bern is ( the Swiss variety of Standard ) German , but the main spoken language is the Alemannic Swiss German dialect called Bernese German .
Publius Vergilius Maro ( Classical Latin : [ ˈpuː.blɪ.ʊs wɛrˈɡɪ.lɪ.ʊs ˈma.roː ] ; October 15 , 70 BC – September 21 , 19 BC ) , usually called Virgil or Vergil /ˈvɜːrdʒᵻl/ in English , was an ancient Roman poet of the Augustan period . He is known for three major works of Latin literature , the Eclogues ( or Bucolics ) , the Georgics , and the epic Aeneid . A number of minor poems , collected in the Appendix Vergiliana , are sometimes attributed to him .
The annual NFL Experience was held at the Moscone Center in San Francisco . In addition , " Super Bowl City " opened on January 30 at Justin Herman Plaza on The Embarcadero , featuring games and activities that will highlight the Bay Area 's technology , culinary creations , and cultural diversity . More than 1 million people are expected to attend the festivities in San Francisco during Super Bowl Week . San Francisco mayor Ed Lee said of the highly visible homeless presence in this area " they are going to have to leave " . San Francisco city supervisor Jane Kim unsuccessfully lobbied for the NFL to reimburse San Francisco for city services in the amount of $ 5 million .
There is evidence of induced copper deficiency in those taking 100–300 mg of zinc daily . A 2007 trial observed that elderly men taking 80 mg daily were hospitalized for urinary complications more often than those taking a placebo . The USDA RDA is 11 and 8 mg Zn/day for men and women , respectively . Levels of 100–300 mg may interfere with the utilization of copper and iron or adversely affect cholesterol . Levels of zinc in excess of 500 ppm in soil interfere with the ability of plants to absorb other essential metals , such as iron and manganese . There is also a condition called the zinc shakes or " zinc chills " that can be induced by the inhalation of freshly formed zinc oxide formed during the welding of galvanized materials . Zinc is a common ingredient of denture cream which may contain between 17 and 38 mg of zinc per gram . There have been claims of disability , and even death , due to excessive use of these products .
In America , nonprofit organizations like Friends of UNFPA ( formerly Americans for UNFPA ) worked to compensate for the loss of United States federal funding by raising private donations .
In accordance with tradition , they sign by placing the title " Cardinal " ( abbreviated Card . ) after their personal name and before their surname as , for instance , " John Card ( inal ) Doe " or , in Latin , " Ioannes Card ( inalis ) Cognomen " . Some writers , such as James-Charles Noonan , hold that , in the case of cardinals , the form used for signatures should be used also when referring to them in English . Official sources such as the Archdiocese of Milwaukee and Catholic News Service say that the correct form for referring to a cardinal in English is normally as " Cardinal [ First name ] [ Surname ] " . This is the rule given also in stylebooks not associated with the Catholic Church . This style is also generally followed on the websites of the Holy See and episcopal conferences . Oriental Patriarchs who are created Cardinals customarily use " Sanctae Ecclesiae Cardinalis " as their full title , probably because they do not belong to the Roman clergy .
Over the next five days , private conferences were held to determine Luther 's fate . The Emperor presented the final draft of the Edict of Worms on 25 May 1521 , declaring Luther an outlaw , banning his literature , and requiring his arrest : " We want him to be apprehended and punished as a notorious heretic . " It also made it a crime for anyone in Germany to give Luther food or shelter . It permitted anyone to kill Luther without legal consequence .
His translation of the Bible into the vernacular ( instead of Latin ) made it more accessible , which had a tremendous impact on the church and German culture . It fostered the development of a standard version of the German language , added several principles to the art of translation , and influenced the writing of an English translation , the Tyndale Bible . His hymns influenced the development of singing in churches . His marriage to Katharina von Bora set a model for the practice of clerical marriage , allowing Protestant clergy to marry .
When not celebrating Mass but still serving a liturgical function , such as the semiannual Urbi et Orbi papal blessing , some Papal Masses and some events at Ecumenical Councils , cardinal deacons can be recognized by the dalmatics they would don with the simple white mitre ( so called mitra simplex ) .
There are eleven Renaissance allegorical statues on public fountains in the Old Town . Nearly all the 16th century fountains , except the Zähringer fountain which was created by Hans Hiltbrand , are the work of the Fribourg master Hans Gieng . One of the more interesting fountains is the Kindlifresserbrunnen ( Bernese German : Child Eater Fountain but often translated Ogre Fountain ) which is claimed to represent a Jew , the Greek god Chronos or a Fastnacht figure that scares disobedient children .
In the early 1970s the Rolling Stones developed their hard rock sound with Exile on Main St. ( 1972 ) . Initially receiving mixed reviews , according to critic Steve Erlewine it is now " generally regarded as the Rolling Stones ' finest album " . They continued to pursue the riff-heavy sound on albums including It 's Only Rock 'n ' Roll ( 1974 ) and Black and Blue ( 1976 ) . Led Zeppelin began to mix elements of world and folk music into their hard rock from Led Zeppelin III ( 1970 ) and Led Zeppelin IV ( 1971 ) . The latter included the track " Stairway to Heaven " , which would become the most played song in the history of album-oriented radio . Deep Purple continued to define hard rock , particularly with their album Machine Head ( 1972 ) , which included the tracks " Highway Star " and " Smoke on the Water " . In 1975 guitarist Ritchie Blackmore left , going on to form Rainbow and after the break-up of the band the next year , vocalist David Coverdale formed Whitesnake . 1970 saw The Who release Live at Leeds , often seen as the archetypal hard rock live album , and the following year they released their highly acclaimed album Who 's Next , which mixed heavy rock with extensive use of synthesizers . Subsequent albums , including Quadrophenia ( 1973 ) , built on this sound before Who Are You ( 1978 ) , their last album before the death of pioneering rock drummer Keith Moon later that year .
The Rose Garden ( Rosengarten ) , from which a scenic panoramic view of the medieval town centre can be enjoyed , is a well-kept Rosarium on a hill , converted into a park from a former cemetery in 1913 .
Cardinal bishops ( cardinals of the episcopal order ) are among the most senior prelates of the Catholic Church . Though in modern times most cardinals are also bishops , the term " cardinal bishop " only refers to the cardinals who are titular bishops of one of the " suburbicarian " sees .
Alan Dershowitz described Sudan as an example of a government that " actually deserve ( s ) " the appellation " apartheid . " Former Canadian Minister of Justice Irwin Cotler echoed the accusation .
In 1507 , he was ordained to the priesthood , and in 1508 , von Staupitz , first dean of the newly founded University of Wittenberg , sent for Luther , to teach theology . He received a bachelor 's degree in Biblical studies on 9 March 1508 , and another bachelor 's degree in the Sentences by Peter Lombard in 1509 .

This was the first Super Bowl to feature a quarterback on both teams who was the # 1 pick in their draft classes . Manning was the # 1 selection of the 1998 NFL draft , while Newton was picked first in 2011 . The matchup also pits the top two picks of the 2011 draft against each other : Newton for Carolina and Von Miller for Denver . Manning and Newton also set the record for the largest age difference between opposing Super Bowl quarterbacks at 13 years and 48 days ( Manning was 39 , Newton was 26 ) .
The Fund raises awareness of and supports efforts to meet these needs in developing countries , advocates close attention to population concerns , and helps developing nations formulate policies and strategies in support of sustainable development . Dr. Osotimehin assumed leadership in January 2011 . The Fund is also represented by UNFPA Goodwill Ambassadors and a Patron .
While BSkyB had been excluded from being a part of the ONdigital consortium , thereby making them a competitor by default , BSkyB was able to join ITV Digital 's free-to-air replacement , Freeview , in which it holds an equal stake with the BBC , ITV , Channel 4 and National Grid Wireless . Prior to October 2005 , three BSkyB channels were available on this platform : Sky News , Sky Three , and Sky Sports News . Initially BSkyB provided Sky Travel to the service . However , this was replaced by Sky Three on 31 October 2005 , which was itself later re-branded as 'Pick TV ' in 2011 .
Despite some concerns , western vegetarians and vegans have not been found to suffer from overt zinc deficiencies any more than meat-eaters . Major plant sources of zinc include cooked dried beans , sea vegetables , fortified cereals , soyfoods , nuts , peas , and seeds . However , phytates in many whole-grains and fiber in many foods may interfere with zinc absorption and marginal zinc intake has poorly understood effects . The zinc chelator phytate , found in seeds and cereal bran , can contribute to zinc malabsorption . There is some evidence to suggest that more than the US RDA ( 15 mg ) of zinc daily may be needed in those whose diet is high in phytates , such as some vegetarians . These considerations must be balanced against the fact that there is a paucity of adequate zinc biomarkers , and the most widely used indicator , plasma zinc , has poor sensitivity and specificity . Diagnosing zinc deficiency is a persistent challenge .
On 17 December 1941 , seven Protestant regional church confederations issued a statement agreeing with the policy of forcing Jews to wear the yellow badge , " since after his bitter experience Luther had already suggested preventive measures against the Jews and their expulsion from German territory . " According to Daniel Goldhagen , Bishop Martin Sasse , a leading Protestant churchman , published a compendium of Luther 's writings shortly after Kristallnacht , for which Diarmaid MacCulloch , Professor of the History of the Church in the University of Oxford argued that Luther 's writing was a " blueprint . " Sasse applauded the burning of the synagogues and the coincidence of the day , writing in the introduction , " On 10 November 1938 , on Luther 's birthday , the synagogues are burning in Germany . " The German people , he urged , ought to heed these words " of the greatest antisemite of his time , the warner of his people against the Jews . "
The game 's media day , which was typically held on the Tuesday afternoon prior to the game , was moved to the Monday evening and re-branded as Super Bowl Opening Night .

Cornerbacks Aqib Talib ( three interceptions ) and Chris Harris , Jr. ( two interceptions ) were the other two Pro Bowl selections from the defense .
Westwood One will carry the game throughout North America , with Kevin Harlan as play-by-play announcer , Boomer Esiason and Dan Fouts as color analysts , and James Lofton and Mark Malone as sideline reporters . Jim Gray will anchor the pre-game and halftime coverage .
In January 1519 , at Altenburg in Saxony , the papal nuncio Karl von Miltitz adopted a more conciliatory approach . Luther made certain concessions to the Saxon , who was a relative of the Elector , and promised to remain silent if his opponents did . The theologian Johann Eck , however , was determined to expose Luther 's doctrine in a public forum . In June and July 1519 , he staged a disputation with Luther 's colleague Andreas Karlstadt at Leipzig and invited Luther to speak . Luther 's boldest assertion in the debate was that Matthew 16:18 does not confer on popes the exclusive right to interpret scripture , and that therefore neither popes nor church councils were infallible . For this , Eck branded Luther a new Jan Hus , referring to the Czech reformer and heretic burned at the stake in 1415 . From that moment , he devoted himself to Luther 's defeat .
In the late 1960s , the term heavy metal was used interchangeably with hard rock , but gradually began to be used to describe music played with even more volume and intensity . While hard rock maintained a bluesy rock and roll identity , including some swing in the back beat and riffs that tended to outline chord progressions in their hooks , heavy metal 's riffs often functioned as stand-alone melodies and had no swing in them . Heavy metal took on " darker " characteristics after Black Sabbath 's breakthrough at the beginning of the 1970s . In the 1980s it developed a number of subgenres , often termed extreme metal , some of which were influenced by hardcore punk , and which further differentiated the two styles . Despite this differentiation , hard rock and heavy metal have existed side by side , with bands frequently standing on the boundary of , or crossing between , the genres .
In 1542 , Luther read a Latin translation of the Qur'an . He went on to produce several critical pamphlets on Islam , which he called " Mohammedanism " or " the Turk " . Though Luther saw the Muslim faith as a tool of the devil , he was indifferent to its practice : " Let the Turk believe and live as he will , just as one lets the papacy and other false Christians live . " He opposed banning the publication of the Qur'an , wanting it exposed to scrutiny .

The bandolim ( Portuguese for " mandolin " ) was a favourite instrument within the Portuguese bourgeoisie of the 19th century , but its rapid spread took it to other places , joining other instruments . Today you can see mandolins as part of the traditional and folk culture of Portuguese singing groups and the majority of the mandolin scene in Portugal is in Madeira Island . Madeira has over 17 active mandolin Orchestras and Tunas . The mandolin virtuoso Fabio Machado is one of Portugal 's most accomplished mandolin players . The Portuguese influence brought the mandolin to Brazil .
He insisted that , since forgiveness was God 's alone to grant , those who claimed that indulgences absolved buyers from all punishments and granted them salvation were in error . Christians , he said , must not slacken in following Christ on account of such false assurances .
The Suez Canal is an artificial sea-level waterway in Egypt considered the most important centre of the maritime transport in the Middle East , connecting the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea . Opened in November 1869 after 10 years of construction work , it allows ship transport between Europe and Asia without navigation around Africa . The northern terminus is Port Said and the southern terminus is Port Tawfiq at the city of Suez . Ismailia lies on its west bank , 3 km ( 1.9 mi ) from the half-way point .
The element was probably named by the alchemist Paracelsus after the German word Zinke ( prong , tooth ) . German chemist Andreas Sigismund Marggraf is credited with discovering pure metallic zinc in 1746 . Work by Luigi Galvani and Alessandro Volta uncovered the electrochemical properties of zinc by 1800 . Corrosion-resistant zinc plating of iron ( hot-dip galvanizing ) is the major application for zinc . Other applications are in batteries , small non-structural castings , and alloys , such as brass . A variety of zinc compounds are commonly used , such as zinc carbonate and zinc gluconate ( as dietary supplements ) , zinc chloride ( in deodorants ) , zinc pyrithione ( anti-dandruff shampoos ) , zinc sulfide ( in luminescent paints ) , and zinc methyl or zinc diethyl in the organic laboratory .
Communism remained an important focus especially during the 1950s and 1960s . Colonialism and racism were important issues that arose . In general , there was a marked trend towards a pragmatic approach to political issues , rather than a philosophical one . Much academic debate regarded one or both of two pragmatic topics : how ( or whether ) to apply utilitarianism to problems of political policy , or how ( or whether ) to apply economic models ( such as rational choice theory ) to political issues . The rise of feminism , LGBT social movements and the end of colonial rule and of the political exclusion of such minorities as African Americans and sexual minorities in the developed world has led to feminist , postcolonial , and multicultural thought becoming significant . This led to a challenge to the social contract by philosophers Charles W. Mills in his book The Racial Contract and Carole Patemen in her book The Sexual Contract that the social contract excluded persons of colour and women respectively .
These styles generally have either two f-shaped soundholes like a violin ( F-5 and A-5 ) , or an oval sound hole ( F-4 and A-4 and lower models ) directly under the strings . Much variation exists between makers working from these archetypes , and other variants have become increasingly common . Generally , in the United States , Gibson F-hole F-5 mandolins and mandolins influenced by that design are strongly associated with bluegrass , while the A-style is associated other types of music , although it too is most often used for and associated with bluegrass . The F-5 's more complicated woodwork also translates into a more expensive instrument .
The plan stated that the following numbers of species of different groups had been recorded from Egypt : algae ( 1483 species ) , animals ( about 15,000 species of which more than 10,000 were insects ) , fungi ( more than 627 species ) , monera ( 319 species ) , plants ( 2426 species ) , protozoans ( 371 species ) . For some major groups , for example lichen-forming fungi and nematode worms , the number was not known . Apart from small and well-studied groups like amphibians , birds , fish , mammals and reptiles , the many of those numbers are likely to increase as further species are recorded from Egypt . For the fungi , including lichen-forming species , for example , subsequent work has shown that over 2200 species have been recorded from Egypt , and the final figure of all fungi actually occurring in the country is expected to be much higher .
In July 2013 , the English High Court of Justice found that Microsoft ’ s use of the term " SkyDrive " infringed on Sky ’ s right to the " Sky " trademark . On 31 July 2013 , BSkyB and Microsoft announced their settlement , in which Microsoft will not appeal the ruling , and will rename its SkyDrive cloud storage service after an unspecified " reasonable period of time to allow for an orderly transition to a new brand , " plus " financial and other terms , the details of which are confidential " . On 27 January 2014 , Microsoft announced " that SkyDrive will soon become OneDrive " and " SkyDrive Pro " becomes " OneDrive for Business " .
The United Nations Population Fund ( UNFPA ) , formerly the United Nations Fund for Population Activities , is a UN organization . The UNFPA says it " is the lead UN agency for delivering a world where every pregnancy is wanted , every childbirth is safe and every young person 's potential is fulfilled . " Their work involves the improvement of reproductive health ; including creation of national strategies and protocols , and providing supplies and services . The organization has recently been known for its worldwide campaign against obstetric fistula and female genital mutilation .
As a non-directive and flexible analytical tool , the concept of boundaries helps both to map and to define the changeability and mutability that are characteristic of people 's experiences of the self in society . While identity is a volatile , flexible and abstract 'thing ' , its manifestations and the ways in which it is exercised are often open to view . Identity is made evident through the use of markers such as language , dress , behaviour and choice of space , whose effect depends on their recognition by other social beings . Markers help to create the boundaries that define similarities or differences between the marker wearer and the marker perceivers , their effectiveness depends on a shared understanding of their meaning . In a social context , misunderstandings can arise due to a misinterpretation of the significance of specific markers . Equally , an individual can use markers of identity to exert influence on other people without necessarily fulfilling all the criteria that an external observer might typically associate with such an abstract identity .
Additionally , there are around 60,000 non-Jewish African immigrants in Israel , some of whom have sought asylum . Most of the migrants are from communities in Sudan and Eritrea , particularly the Niger-Congo-speaking Nuba groups of the southern Nuba Mountains ; some are illegal immigrants .
Following their loss in the divisional round of the previous season 's playoffs , the Denver Broncos underwent numerous coaching changes , including a mutual parting with head coach John Fox ( who had won four divisional championships in his four years as Broncos head coach ) , and the hiring of Gary Kubiak as the new head coach . Under Kubiak , the Broncos planned to install a run-oriented offense with zone blocking to blend in with quarterback Peyton Manning 's shotgun passing skills , but struggled with numerous changes and injuries to the offensive line , as well as Manning having his worst statistical season since his rookie year with the Indianapolis Colts in 1998 , due to a plantar fasciitis injury in his heel that he had suffered since the summer , and the simple fact that Manning was getting old , as he turned 39 in the 2015 off-season . Although the team had a 7–0 start , Manning led the NFL in interceptions . In week 10 , Manning suffered a partial tear of the plantar fasciitis in his left foot . He set the NFL 's all-time record for career passing yards in this game , but was benched after throwing four interceptions in favor of backup quarterback Brock Osweiler , who took over as the starter for most of the remainder of the regular season . Osweiler was injured , however , leading to Manning 's return during the Week 17 regular season finale , where the Broncos were losing 13–7 against the 4–11 San Diego Chargers , resulting in Manning re-claiming the starting quarterback position for the playoffs by leading the team to a key 27–20 win that enabled the team to clinch the number one overall AFC seed . Under defensive coordinator Wade Phillips , the Broncos ' defense ranked number one in total yards allowed , passing yards allowed and sacks , and like the previous three seasons , the team has continued to set numerous individual , league and franchise records . With the defense carrying the team despite the issues with the offense , the Broncos finished the regular season with a 12–4 record and earned home-field advantage throughout the AFC playoffs .
Luther came to understand justification as entirely the work of God . This teaching by Luther was clearly expressed in his 1525 publication On the Bondage of the Will , which was written in response to On Free Will by Desiderius Erasmus ( 1524 ) . Luther based his position on predestination on St. Paul 's epistle to the Ephesians 2:8–10 . Against the teaching of his day that the righteous acts of believers are performed in cooperation with God , Luther wrote that Christians receive such righteousness entirely from outside themselves ; that righteousness not only comes from Christ but actually is the righteousness of Christ , imputed to Christians ( rather than infused into them ) through faith . " That is why faith alone makes someone just and fulfills the law , " he wrote . " Faith is that which brings the Holy Spirit through the merits of Christ . " Faith , for Luther , was a gift from God ; the experience of being justified by faith was " as though I had been born again . " His entry into Paradise , no less , was a discovery about " the righteousness of God " – a discovery that " the just person " of whom the Bible speaks ( as in Romans 1:17 ) lives by faith . He explained his concept of " justification " in the Smalcald Articles :
Some established acts continued to enjoy commercial success , such as Aerosmith , with their number one multi-platinum albums : Get a Grip ( 1993 ) , which produced four Top 40 singles and became the band 's best-selling album worldwide ( going on to sell over 10 million copies ) , and Nine Lives ( 1997 ) . In 1998 , Aerosmith released the number one hit " I Do n't Want to Miss a Thing " , which remains the only single by a hard rock band to debut at number one . AC/DC produced the double platinum Ballbreaker ( 1995 ) . Bon Jovi appealed to their hard rock audience with songs such as " Keep the Faith " ( 1992 ) , but also achieved success in adult contemporary radio , with the Top 10 ballads " Bed of Roses " ( 1993 ) and " Always " ( 1994 ) . Bon Jovi 's 1995 album These Days was a bigger hit in Europe than it was in the United States , spawning four Top 10 singles on the UK Singles Chart . Metallica 's Load ( 1996 ) and ReLoad ( 1997 ) each sold in excess of 4 million copies in the US and saw the band develop a more melodic and blues rock sound . As the initial impetus of grunge bands faltered in the middle years of the decade , post-grunge bands emerged . They emulated the attitudes and music of grunge , particularly thick , distorted guitars , but with a more radio-friendly commercially oriented sound that drew more directly on traditional hard rock . Among the most successful acts were the Foo Fighters , Candlebox , Live , Collective Soul , Australia 's Silverchair and England 's Bush , who all cemented post-grunge as one of the most commercially viable subgenres by the late 1990s . Similarly , some post-Britpop bands that followed in the wake of Oasis , including Feeder and Stereophonics , adopted a hard rock or " pop-metal " sound .
However , according to then-Secretary of State Colin Powell , the UNFPA contributed vehicles and computers to the Chinese to carry out their population control policies . However , both the Washington Post and the Washington Times reported that Powell simply fell in line , signing a brief written by someone else .
In 1353 Bern joined the Swiss Confederacy , becoming one of the eight cantons of the formative period of 1353 to 1481 . Bern invaded and conquered Aargau in 1415 and Vaud in 1536 , as well as other smaller territories ; thereby becoming the largest city-state north of the Alps , by the 18th century comprising most of what is today the canton of Bern and the canton of Vaud .
Isidore of Seville , writing in the 7th century , claimed that the Latin word Maurus was derived from the Greek mauron , μαύρον , which is the Greek word for black . Indeed , by the time Isidore of Seville came to write his Etymologies , the word Maurus or " Moor " had become an adjective in Latin , " for the Greeks call black , mauron " . " In Isidore ’ s day , Moors were black by definition… "
There is disagreement about the origin of the term , but general consensus that " cardinalis " from the word cardo ( meaning 'pivot ' or 'hinge ' ) was first used in late antiquity to designate a bishop or priest who was incorporated into a church for which he had not originally been ordained . In Rome the first persons to be called cardinals were the deacons of the seven regions of the city at the beginning of the 6th century , when the word began to mean “ principal , ” “ eminent , ” or " superior . " The name was also given to the senior priest in each of the " title " churches ( the parish churches ) of Rome and to the bishops of the seven sees surrounding the city . By the 8th century the Roman cardinals constituted a privileged class among the Roman clergy . They took part in the administration of the church of Rome and in the papal liturgy . By decree of a synod of 769 , only a cardinal was eligible to become pope . In 1059 , during the pontificate of Nicholas II , cardinals were given the right to elect the pope under the Papal Bull In nomine Domini . For a time this power was assigned exclusively to the cardinal bishops , but the Third Lateran Council in 1179 gave back the right to the whole body of cardinals . Cardinals were granted the privilege of wearing the red hat by Pope Innocent IV in 1244 .
Established acts benefited from the new commercial climate , with Whitesnake 's self-titled album ( 1987 ) selling over 17 million copies , outperforming anything in Coverdale 's or Deep Purple 's catalogue before or since . It featured the rock anthem " Here I Go Again '87 " as one of 4 UK top 20 singles . The follow-up Slip of the Tongue ( 1989 ) went platinum , but according to critics Steve Erlwine and Greg Prato , " it was a considerable disappointment after the across-the-board success of Whitesnake " . Aerosmith 's comeback album Permanent Vacation ( 1987 ) would begin a decade long revival of their popularity . Crazy Nights ( 1987 ) by Kiss was the band 's highest charting release in the US since 1979 and the highest of their career in the UK . Mötley Crüe with Girls , Girls , Girls ( 1987 ) continued their commercial success and Def Leppard with Hysteria ( 1987 ) hit their commercial peak , the latter producing seven hit singles ( a record for a hard rock act ) . Guns N ' Roses released the best-selling début of all time , Appetite for Destruction ( 1987 ) . With a " grittier " and " rawer " sound than most glam metal , it produced three top 10 hits , including the number one " Sweet Child O ' Mine " . Some of the glam rock bands that formed in the mid-1980s , such as White Lion and Cinderella experienced their biggest success during this period with their respective albums Pride ( 1987 ) and Long Cold Winter ( 1988 ) both going multi-platinum and launching a series of hit singles . In the last years of the decade , the most notable successes were New Jersey ( 1988 ) by Bon Jovi , OU812 ( 1988 ) by Van Halen , Open Up and Say ... Ahh ! ( 1988 ) by Poison , Pump ( 1989 ) by Aerosmith , and Mötley Crüe 's most commercially successful album Dr. Feelgood ( 1989 ) . New Jersey spawned five Top 10 singles , a record for a hard rock act . In 1988 from 25 June to 5 November , the number one spot on the Billboard 200 album chart was held by a hard rock album for 18 out of 20 consecutive weeks ; the albums were OU812 , Hysteria , Appetite for Destruction , and New Jersey . A final wave of glam rock bands arrived in the late 1980s , and experienced success with multi-platinum albums and hit singles from 1989 until the early 1990s , among them Extreme , Warrant Slaughter and FireHouse . Skid Row also released their eponymous début ( 1989 ) , reaching number six on the Billboard 200 , but they were to be one of the last major bands that emerged in the glam rock era .

Alloys of primarily zinc with small amounts of copper , aluminium , and magnesium are useful in die casting as well as spin casting , especially in the automotive , electrical , and hardware industries . These alloys are marketed under the name Zamak . An example of this is zinc aluminium . The low melting point together with the low viscosity of the alloy makes the production of small and intricate shapes possible . The low working temperature leads to rapid cooling of the cast products and therefore fast assembly is possible . Another alloy , marketed under the brand name Prestal , contains 78 % zinc and 22 % aluminium and is reported to be nearly as strong as steel but as malleable as plastic . This superplasticity of the alloy allows it to be molded using die casts made of ceramics and cement .
Zinc deficiency is crop plants ' most common micronutrient deficiency ; it is particularly common in high-pH soils . Zinc-deficient soil is cultivated in the cropland of about half of Turkey and India , a third of China , and most of Western Australia , and substantial responses to zinc fertilization have been reported in these areas . Plants that grow in soils that are zinc-deficient are more susceptible to disease . Zinc is primarily added to the soil through the weathering of rocks , but humans have added zinc through fossil fuel combustion , mine waste , phosphate fertilizers , pesticide ( zinc phosphide ) , limestone , manure , sewage sludge , and particles from galvanized surfaces . Excess zinc is toxic to plants , although zinc toxicity is far less widespread .
In the United Kingdom , BBC Radio 5 Live and 5 Live Sports Extra will carry the contest . The BBC will carry its own British English broadcast , with Greg Brady , Darren Fletcher and Rocky Boiman on commentary .
In 2008 , the High Court in South Africa ruled that Chinese South Africans who were residents during the apartheid era ( and their descendants ) are to be reclassified as " Black people , " solely for the purposes of accessing affirmative action benefits , because they were also " disadvantaged " by racial discrimination . Chinese people who arrived in the country after the end of apartheid do not qualify for such benefits .
In 1988 , the civil rights leader Jesse Jackson urged Americans to use instead the term " African American " because it had a historical cultural base and was a construction similar to terms used by European descendants , such as German American , Italian American , etc . Since then , African American and black have often had parallel status . However , controversy continues over which if any of the two terms is more appropriate . Maulana Karenga argues that the term African-American is more appropriate because it accurately articulates their geographical and historical origin . [ citation needed ] Others have argued that " black " is a better term because " African " suggests foreignness , although Black Americans helped found the United States . Still others believe that the term black is inaccurate because African Americans have a variety of skin tones . Some surveys suggest that the majority of Black Americans have no preference for " African American " or " Black " , although they have a slight preference for " black " in personal settings and " African American " in more formal settings .
In the Middle Ages , Virgil 's reputation was such that it inspired legends associating him with magic and prophecy . From at least the 3rd century , Christian thinkers interpreted Eclogues 4 , which describes the birth of a boy ushering in a golden age , as a prediction of Jesus ' birth . As such , Virgil came to be seen on a similar level as the Hebrew prophets of the Bible as one who had heralded Christianity .
Zinc is a bluish-white , lustrous , diamagnetic metal , though most common commercial grades of the metal have a dull finish . It is somewhat less dense than iron and has a hexagonal crystal structure , with a distorted form of hexagonal close packing , in which each atom has six nearest neighbors ( at 265.9 pm ) in its own plane and six others at a greater distance of 290.6 pm . The metal is hard and brittle at most temperatures but becomes malleable between 100 and 150 °C . Above 210 °C , the metal becomes brittle again and can be pulverized by beating . Zinc is a fair conductor of electricity . For a metal , zinc has relatively low melting ( 419.5 °C ) and boiling points ( 907 °C ) . Its melting point is the lowest of all the transition metals aside from mercury and cadmium .
Carolina suffered a major setback when Thomas Davis , an 11-year veteran who had already overcome three ACL tears in his career , went down with a broken arm in the NFC Championship Game . Despite this , he insisted he would still find a way to play in the Super Bowl . His prediction turned out to be accurate .
In honor of the 50th Super Bowl , the pregame ceremony featured the on-field introduction of 39 of the 43 previous Super Bowl Most Valuable Players . Bart Starr ( MVP of Super Bowls I and II ) and Chuck Howley ( MVP of Super Bowl V ) appeared via video , while Peyton Manning ( MVP of Super Bowl XLI and current Broncos quarterback ) was shown in the locker room preparing for the game . No plans were announced regarding the recognition of Harvey Martin , co-MVP of Super Bowl XII , who died in 2001 .
In the Colonial America of 1619 , John Rolfe used negars in describing the slaves who were captured from West Africa and then shipped to the Virginia colony . Later American English spellings , neger and neggar , prevailed in a northern colony , New York under the Dutch , and in metropolitan Philadelphia 's Moravian and Pennsylvania Dutch communities ; the African Burial Ground in New York City originally was known by the Dutch name " Begraafplaats van de Neger " ( Cemetery of the Negro ) ; an early US occurrence of neger in Rhode Island , dates from 1625 . Thomas Jefferson also used the term " black " in his Notes on the State of Virginia in allusion to the slave populations .
The Fund raises awareness of and supports efforts to meet these needs in developing countries , advocates close attention to population concerns , and helps developing nations formulate policies and strategies in support of sustainable development . Dr. Osotimehin assumed leadership in January 2011 . The Fund is also represented by UNFPA Goodwill Ambassadors and a Patron .
The Panthers beat the Seattle Seahawks in the divisional round , running up a 31–0 halftime lead and then holding off a furious second half comeback attempt to win 31–24 , avenging their elimination from a year earlier . The Panthers then blew out the Arizona Cardinals in the NFC Championship Game , 49–15 , racking up 487 yards and forcing seven turnovers .
One of the most influential works during this burgeoning period was Niccolò Machiavelli 's The Prince , written between 1511–12 and published in 1532 , after Machiavelli 's death . That work , as well as The Discourses , a rigorous analysis of the classical period , did much to influence modern political thought in the West . A minority ( including Jean-Jacques Rousseau ) interpreted The Prince as a satire meant to be given to the Medici after their recapture of Florence and their subsequent expulsion of Machiavelli from Florence . Though the work was written for the di Medici family in order to perhaps influence them to free him from exile , Machiavelli supported the Republic of Florence rather than the oligarchy of the di Medici family . At any rate , Machiavelli presents a pragmatic and somewhat consequentialist view of politics , whereby good and evil are mere means used to bring about an end—i.e. , the secure and powerful state . Thomas Hobbes , well known for his theory of the social contract , goes on to expand this view at the start of the 17th century during the English Renaissance . Although neither Machiavelli nor Hobbes believed in the divine right of kings , they both believed in the inherent selfishness of the individual . It was necessarily this belief that led them to adopt a strong central power as the only means of preventing the disintegration of the social order .
Virgil is traditionally ranked as one of Rome 's greatest poets . His Aeneid has been considered the national epic of ancient Rome from the time of its composition to the present day . Modeled after Homer 's Iliad and Odyssey , the Aeneid follows the Trojan refugee Aeneas as he struggles to fulfill his destiny and arrive on the shores of Italy—in Roman mythology the founding act of Rome . Virgil 's work has had wide and deep influence on Western literature , most notably Dante 's Divine Comedy , in which Virgil appears as Dante 's guide through hell and purgatory .
By the 1900s , nigger had become a pejorative word in the United States . In its stead , the term colored became the mainstream alternative to negro and its derived terms . After the African-American Civil rights movement , the terms colored and negro gave way to " black " . Negro had superseded colored as the most polite word for African Americans at a time when black was considered more offensive . This term was accepted as normal , including by people classified as Negroes , until the later Civil Rights movement in the late 1960s . One well-known example is the identification by Reverend Martin Luther King , Jr. of his own race as " Negro " in his famous speech of 1963 , I Have a Dream . During the American Civil Rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s , some African-American leaders in the United States , notably Malcolm X , objected to the word Negro because they associated it with the long history of slavery , segregation , and discrimination that treated African Americans as second-class citizens , or worse . Malcolm X preferred Black to Negro , but later gradually abandoned that as well for Afro-American after leaving the Nation of Islam .
The Panthers offense , which led the NFL in scoring ( 500 points ) , was loaded with talent , boasting six Pro Bowl selections . Pro Bowl quarterback Cam Newton had one of his best seasons , throwing for 3,837 yards and rushing for 636 , while recording a career-high and league-leading 45 total touchdowns ( 35 passing , 10 rushing ) , a career-low 10 interceptions , and a career-best quarterback rating of 99.4 . Newton 's leading receivers were tight end Greg Olsen , who caught a career-high 77 passes for 1,104 yards and seven touchdowns , and wide receiver Ted Ginn , Jr. , who caught 44 passes for 739 yards and 10 touchdowns ; Ginn also rushed for 60 yards and returned 27 punts for 277 yards . Other key receivers included veteran Jerricho Cotchery ( 39 receptions for 485 yards ) , rookie Devin Funchess ( 31 receptions for 473 yards and five touchdowns ) , and second-year receiver Corey Brown ( 31 receptions for 447 yards ) . The Panthers backfield featured Pro Bowl running back Jonathan Stewart , who led the team with 989 rushing yards and six touchdowns in 13 games , along with Pro Bowl fullback Mike Tolbert , who rushed for 256 yards and caught 18 passes for another 154 yards . Carolina 's offensive line also featured two Pro Bowl selections : center Ryan Kalil and guard Trai Turner .
His translation of the Bible into the vernacular ( instead of Latin ) made it more accessible , which had a tremendous impact on the church and German culture . It fostered the development of a standard version of the German language , added several principles to the art of translation , and influenced the writing of an English translation , the Tyndale Bible . His hymns influenced the development of singing in churches . His marriage to Katharina von Bora set a model for the practice of clerical marriage , allowing Protestant clergy to marry .
The Super Bowl 50 Host Committee has vowed to be " the most giving Super Bowl ever " , and will dedicate 25 percent of all money it raises for philanthropic causes in the Bay Area . The committee created the 50 fund as its philanthropic initiative and focuses on providing grants to aid with youth development , community investment and sustainable environments .
It includes the entire Old Town , which is also a UNESCO World Heritage Site , and many sites within and around it . Some of the most notable in the Old Town include the Cathedral which was started in 1421 and is the tallest cathedral in Switzerland , the Zytglogge and Käfigturm towers , which mark two successive expansions of the Old Town , and the Holy Ghost Church , which is one of the largest Swiss Reformed churches in Switzerland . Within the Old Town , there are eleven 16th century fountains , most attributed to Hans Gieng , that are on the list .
Eastern Catholic cardinals continue to wear the normal dress appropriate to their liturgical tradition , though some may line their cassocks with scarlet and wear scarlet fascias , or in some cases , wear Eastern-style cassocks entirely of scarlet .
Black people is a term used in certain countries , often in socially based systems of racial classification or of ethnicity , to describe persons who are perceived to be dark-skinned compared to other given populations . As such , the meaning of the expression varies widely both between and within societies , and depends significantly on context . For many other individuals , communities and countries , " black " is also perceived as a derogatory , outdated , reductive or otherwise unrepresentative label , and as a result is neither used nor defined .
Early in 1537 , Johannes Agricola ( 1494–1566 ) – serving at the time as pastor in Luther 's birthplace , Eisleben – preached a sermon in which he claimed that God 's gospel , not God 's moral law ( the Ten Commandments ) , revealed God 's wrath to Christians . Based on this sermon and others by Agricola , Luther suspected that Agricola was behind certain anonymous antinomian theses circulating in Wittenberg . These theses asserted that the law is no longer to be taught to Christians but belonged only to city hall . Luther responded to these theses with six series of theses against Agricola and the antinomians , four of which became the basis for disputations between 1538 and 1540 . He also responded to these assertions in other writings , such as his 1539 open letter to C. Güttel Against the Antinomians , and his book On the Councils and the Church from the same year .

Luther was a prolific hymn-writer , authoring hymns such as " Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott " ( " A Mighty Fortress Is Our God " ) , based on Psalm 46 , and " Vom Himmel hoch , da komm ich her " ( " From Heaven Above to Earth I Come " ) , based on Luke 2:11–12 . Luther connected high art and folk music , also all classes , clergy and laity , men , women and children . His tool of choice for this connection was the singing of German hymns in connection with worship , school , home , and the public arena . He often accompanied the sung hymns with a lute , later recreated as the waldzither that became a national instrument of Germany in the 20th century .
Isidore of Seville , writing in the 7th century , claimed that the Latin word Maurus was derived from the Greek mauron , μαύρον , which is the Greek word for black . Indeed , by the time Isidore of Seville came to write his Etymologies , the word Maurus or " Moor " had become an adjective in Latin , " for the Greeks call black , mauron " . " In Isidore ’ s day , Moors were black by definition… "
The Roman Missal and the Roman Rite Liturgy of the Hours naturally includes references to Mary 's immaculate conception in the feast of the Immaculate Conception . An example is the antiphon that begins : " Tota pulchra es , Maria , et macula originalis non est in te " ( You are all beautiful , Mary , and the original stain [ of sin ] is not in you . Your clothing is white as snow , and your face is like the sun . You are all beautiful , Mary , and the original stain [ of sin ] is not in you . You are the glory of Jerusalem , you are the joy of Israel , you give honour to our people . You are all beautiful , Mary . ) On the basis of the original Gregorian chant music , polyphonic settings have been composed by Anton Bruckner , Pablo Casals , Maurice Duruflé , Grzegorz Gerwazy Gorczycki , no : Ola Gjeilo , José Maurício Nunes Garcia , and Nikolaus Schapfl ,
Luther 's disappearance during his return trip back to Wittenberg was planned . Frederick III had him intercepted on his way home in the forest near Wittenberg by masked horsemen who were made to appear as armed highwaymen . They escorted Luther to the security of the Wartburg Castle at Eisenach . During his stay at Wartburg , which he referred to as " my Patmos " , Luther translated the New Testament from Greek into German and poured out doctrinal and polemical writings . These included a renewed attack on Archbishop Albrecht of Mainz , whom he shamed into halting the sale of indulgences in his episcopates , and a " Refutation of the Argument of Latomus , " in which he expounded the principle of justification to Jacobus Latomus , an orthodox theologian from Louvain .
Scholars disagree over the effects of social status on racial classifications in Brazil . It is generally believed that achieving upward mobility and education results in individuals being classified as a category of lighter skin . The popular claim is that in Brazil , poor whites are considered black and wealthy blacks are considered white . Some scholars disagree , arguing that " whitening " of one 's social status may be open to people of mixed race , a large part of the population known as pardo , but a person perceived as preto ( black ) will continue to be classified as black regardless of wealth or social status .
While BSkyB had been excluded from being a part of the ONdigital consortium , thereby making them a competitor by default , BSkyB was able to join ITV Digital 's free-to-air replacement , Freeview , in which it holds an equal stake with the BBC , ITV , Channel 4 and National Grid Wireless . Prior to October 2005 , three BSkyB channels were available on this platform : Sky News , Sky Three , and Sky Sports News . Initially BSkyB provided Sky Travel to the service . However , this was replaced by Sky Three on 31 October 2005 , which was itself later re-branded as 'Pick TV ' in 2011 .
In the United States , macabre-rock pioneer Alice Cooper achieved mainstream success with the top ten album School 's Out ( 1972 ) . In the following year blues rockers ZZ Top released their classic album Tres Hombres and Aerosmith produced their eponymous début , as did Southern rockers Lynyrd Skynyrd and proto-punk outfit New York Dolls , demonstrating the diverse directions being pursued in the genre . Montrose , including the instrumental talent of Ronnie Montrose and vocals of Sammy Hagar and arguably the first all American hard rock band to challenge the British dominance of the genre , released their first album in 1973 . Kiss built on the theatrics of Alice Cooper and the look of the New York Dolls to produce a unique band persona , achieving their commercial breakthrough with the double live album Alive ! in 1975 and helping to take hard rock into the stadium rock era . In the mid-1970s Aerosmith achieved their commercial and artistic breakthrough with Toys in the Attic ( 1975 ) , which reached number 11 in the American album chart , and Rocks ( 1976 ) , which peaked at number three . Blue Öyster Cult , formed in the late 60s , picked up on some of the elements introduced by Black Sabbath with their breakthrough live gold album On Your Feet or on Your Knees ( 1975 ) , followed by their first platinum album , Agents of Fortune ( 1976 ) , containing the hit single " ( Do n't Fear ) The Reaper " , which reached number 12 on the Billboard charts . Journey released their eponymous debut in 1975 and the next year Boston released their highly successful début album . In the same year , hard rock bands featuring women saw commercial success as Heart released Dreamboat Annie and The Runaways débuted with their self-titled album . While Heart had a more folk-oriented hard rock sound , the Runaways leaned more towards a mix of punk-influenced music and hard rock . The Amboy Dukes , having emerged from the Detroit garage rock scene and most famous for their Top 20 psychedelic hit " Journey to the Center of the Mind " ( 1968 ) , were dissolved by their guitarist Ted Nugent , who embarked on a solo career that resulted in four successive multi-platinum albums between Ted Nugent ( 1975 ) and his best selling Double Live Gonzo ( 1978 ) .
When Sky Digital was launched in 1998 the new service used the Astra 2A satellite which was located at the 28.5°E orbital position , unlike the analogue service which was broadcast from 19.2°E . This was subsequently followed by more Astra satellites as well as Eutelsat 's Eurobird 1 ( now Eutelsat 33C ) at 28.5°E ) , enabled the company to launch a new all-digital service , Sky , with the potential to carry hundreds of television and radio channels . The old position was shared with broadcasters from several European countries , while the new position at 28.5°E came to be used almost exclusively for channels that broadcast to the United Kingdom .
On Carolina 's next possession fullback Mike Tolbert lost a fumble while being tackled by safety Darian Stewart , which linebacker Danny Trevathan recovered on the Broncos 40-yard line . However , the Panthers soon took the ball back when defensive end Kony Ealy tipped a Manning pass to himself and then intercepted it , returning the ball 19 yards to the Panthers 39-yard line with 1:55 left on the clock . The Panthers could not gain any yards with their possession and had to punt . After a Denver punt , Carolina drove to the Broncos 45-yard line . But with 11 seconds left , Newton was sacked by DeMarcus Ware as time expired in the half .
These different explorations of 'identity ' demonstrate how difficult a concept it is to pin down . Since identity is a virtual thing , it is impossible to define it empirically . Discussions of identity use the term with different meanings , from fundamental and abiding sameness , to fluidity , contingency , negotiated and so on . Brubaker and Cooper note a tendency in many scholars to confuse identity as a category of practice and as a category of analysis ( Brubaker & Cooper 2000 , p. 5 ) . Indeed , many scholars demonstrate a tendency to follow their own preconceptions of identity , following more or less the frameworks listed above , rather than taking into account the mechanisms by which the concept is crystallised as reality . In this environment , some analysts , such as Brubaker and Cooper , have suggested doing away with the concept completely ( Brubaker & Cooper 2000 , p. 1 ) . Others , by contrast , have sought to introduce alternative concepts in an attempt to capture the dynamic and fluid qualities of human social self-expression . Hall ( 1992 , 1996 ) , for example , suggests treating identity as a process , to take into account the reality of diverse and ever-changing social experience . Some scholars have introduced the idea of identification , whereby identity is perceived as made up of different components that are 'identified ' and interpreted by individuals . The construction of an individual sense of self is achieved by personal choices regarding who and what to associate with . Such approaches are liberating in their recognition of the role of the individual in social interaction and the construction of identity .
The new government drafted and implemented a constitution in 1923 based on a parliamentary system . Saad Zaghlul was popularly elected as Prime Minister of Egypt in 1924 . In 1936 , the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty was concluded . Continued instability due to remaining British influence and increasing political involvement by the king led to the dissolution of the parliament in a military coup d'état known as the 1952 Revolution . The Free Officers Movement forced King Farouk to abdicate in support of his son Fuad . British military presence in Egypt lasted until 1954 .
CBS provided digital streams of the game via CBSSports.com , and the CBS Sports apps on tablets , Windows 10 , Xbox One and other digital media players ( such as Chromecast and Roku ) . Due to Verizon Communications exclusivity , streaming on smartphones was only provided to Verizon Wireless customers via the NFL Mobile service . The ESPN Deportes Spanish broadcast was made available through WatchESPN .
The Panthers seemed primed to score on their opening drive of the second half when Newton completed a 45-yard pass to Ted Ginn Jr. on the Denver 35-yard line on their second offensive play . But the Broncos defense halted the drive on the 26-yard line , and it ended with no points when Graham Gano hit the uprights on a 44-yard field goal attempt . After the miss , Manning completed a pair of passes to Emmanuel Sanders for gains of 25 and 22 yards , setting up McManus ' 33-yard field goal that gave the Broncos a 16–7 lead . Carolina got off to another strong start after the kickoff , with Newton completing a 42-yard pass to Corey Brown . But once again they came up empty , this time as a result of a Newton pass that bounced off the hands of Ginn and was intercepted by safety T. J . Ward . Ward fumbled the ball during the return , but Trevathan recovered it to enable Denver to keep possession .
Noteworthy Irish mandolinists include Andy Irvine ( who , like Johnny Moynihan , almost always tunes the top E down to D , to achieve an open tuning of GDAD ) , Paul Brady , Mick Moloney , Paul Kelly and Claudine Langille . John Sheahan and the late Barney McKenna , respectively fiddle player and tenor banjo player with The Dubliners , are also accomplished Irish mandolin players . The instruments used are either flat-backed , oval hole examples as described above ( made by UK luthier Roger Bucknall of Fylde Guitars ) , or carved-top , oval hole instruments with arched back ( made by Stefan Sobell in Northumberland ) . The Irish guitarist Rory Gallagher often played the mandolin on stage , and he most famously used it in the song " Going To My Hometown . "
The last regular election of the City Parliament was held on 25 November 2012 for the mandate period ( German : Legislatur , French : la législature ) from 2013 to 2016 . Currently the City Parliament consist of 23 members of the Social Democratic Party ( SP/PS ) , 11 Swiss People 's Party ( SVP/UDC ) , 8 Green Alliance of Berne ( GB ) , 8 Grüne Freie Liste ( GFL ) ( Green Free List ) , 7 The Liberals ( FDP/PLR ) , 7 Conservative Democratic Party ( BDP/PBD ) , 7 Green Liberal Party ( GLP/PVL ) , 2 Christian Democratic People 's Party ( CVP/PDC ) , 2 Evangelical People 's Party ( EVP/PEV ) , 1 Junge Alternative ( JA ! ) ( or Young Alternatives ) , 1 Grüne Partei Bern - Demokratische Alternative ( GPB-DA ) ( or Green Party Bern - Democratic Alternative ) , 1 Swiss Party of Labour ( PdA ) , 1 Alternative Linke Bern ( AL ) and finally one independent . The following parties combine their parliamentary power in parliamentary groups ( German : Fraktion ( en ) ) : Independent and AL and GPB-DA and PdA ( 4 ) , SP ( 23 ) , GB and JA ! ( 9 ) , GFL and EVP ( 10 ) , GLP ( 7 ) , BDP and CVP ( 9 ) , FDP ( 7 ) , and SVP ( 11 ) . This gives the left parties an absolute majority of 46 seats .
In his theses and disputations against the antinomians , Luther reviews and reaffirms , on the one hand , what has been called the " second use of the law , " that is , the law as the Holy Spirit 's tool to work sorrow over sin in man 's heart , thus preparing him for Christ 's fulfillment of the law offered in the gospel . Luther states that everything that is used to work sorrow over sin is called the law , even if it is Christ 's life , Christ 's death for sin , or God 's goodness experienced in creation . Simply refusing to preach the Ten Commandments among Christians – thereby , as it were , removing the three letters l-a-w from the church – does not eliminate the accusing law . Claiming that the law – in any form – should not be preached to Christians anymore would be tantamount to asserting that Christians are no longer sinners in themselves and that the church consists only of essentially holy people .
Early in 1537 , Johannes Agricola ( 1494–1566 ) – serving at the time as pastor in Luther 's birthplace , Eisleben – preached a sermon in which he claimed that God 's gospel , not God 's moral law ( the Ten Commandments ) , revealed God 's wrath to Christians .

In 1958 , Egypt and Syria formed a sovereign union known as the United Arab Republic . The union was short-lived , ending in 1961 when Syria seceded , thus ending the union . During most of its existence , the United Arab Republic was also in a loose confederation with North Yemen ( or the Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen ) , known as the United Arab States . In 1959 , the All-Palestine Government of the Gaza Strip , an Egyptian client state , was absorbed into the United Arab Republic under the pretext of Arab union , and was never restored .
The rise of Islam , based on both the Qur'an and Muhammad strongly altered the power balances and perceptions of origin of power in the Mediterranean region . Early Islamic philosophy emphasized an inexorable link between science and religion , and the process of ijtihad to find truth—in effect all philosophy was " political " as it had real implications for governance . This view was challenged by the " rationalist " Mutazilite philosophers , who held a more Hellenic view , reason above revelation , and as such are known to modern scholars as the first speculative theologians of Islam ; they were supported by a secular aristocracy who sought freedom of action independent of the Caliphate . By the late ancient period , however , the " traditionalist " Asharite view of Islam had in general triumphed . According to the Asharites , reason must be subordinate to the Quran and the Sunna .
CBS set the base rate for a 30-second advertisement at $ 5,000,000 , a record high price for a Super Bowl ad . As of January 26 , the advertisements had not yet sold out . CBS mandated that all advertisers purchase a package covering time on both the television and digital broadcasts of the game , meaning that for the first time , digital streams of the game would carry all national advertising in pattern with the television broadcast . This would be the final year in a multi-year contract with Anheuser-Busch InBev that allowed the beer manufacturer to air multiple advertisements during the game at a steep discount . It was also the final year that Doritos , a longtime sponsor of the game , held its " Crash the Super Bowl " contest that allowed viewers to create their own Doritos ads for a chance to have it aired during the game . Nintendo and The Pokémon Company also made their Super Bowl debut , promoting the 20th anniversary of the Pokémon video game and media franchise .
Other scholars argue that , even if his views were merely anti-Judaic—that is , opposed to Judaism and its adherence rather than the Jews as an ethnic group—their violence lent a new element to the standard Christian suspicion of Judaism . Ronald Berger writes that Luther is credited with " Germanizing the Christian critique of Judaism and establishing anti-Semitism as a key element of German culture and national identity . " Paul Rose argues that he caused a " hysterical and demonizing mentality " about Jews to enter German thought and discourse , a mentality that might otherwise have been absent . Christopher J. Probst in his book Demonizing the Jews : Luther and the Protestant Church in Nazi Germany ( 2012 ) , shows that a large number of German Lutheran clergy and theologians during the Nazi Third Reich used Luther 's hostile publications towards the Jews and their Jewish religion to justify at least in part the anti-Semitic policies of the National Socialists .
Phil Skinner played a key role in 20th century development of the mandolin movement in Australia , and was awarded an MBE in 1979 for services to music and the community . He was born Harry Skinner in Sydney in 1903 and started learning music at age 10 when his uncle tutored him on the banjo . Skinner began teaching part-time at age 18 , until the Great Depression forced him to begin teaching full-time and learn a broader range of instruments . Skinner founded the Sydney Mandolin Orchestra , the oldest surviving mandolin orchestra in Australia .
In the first 200 years that black people were in the United States , they primarily identified themselves by their specific ethnic group ( closely allied to language ) and not by skin color . Individuals identified themselves , for example , as Ashanti , Igbo , Bakongo , or Wolof . However , when the first captives were brought to the Americas , they were often combined with other groups from West Africa , and individual ethnic affiliations were not generally acknowledged by English colonists . In areas of the Upper South , different ethnic groups were brought together . This is significant as the captives came from a vast geographic region : the West African coastline stretching from Senegal to Angola and in some cases from the south-east coast such as Mozambique . A new African-American identity and culture was born that incorporated elements of the various ethnic groups and of European cultural heritage , resulting in fusions such as the Black church and Black English . This new identity was based on provenance and slave status rather than membership in any one ethnic group . [ citation needed ] By contrast , slave records from Louisiana show that the French and Spanish colonists recorded more complete identities of the West Africans , including ethnicities and given tribal names .
Manning finished the game 13 of 23 for 141 yards with one interception and zero touchdowns . Sanders was his top receiver with six receptions for 83 yards .

He was also the team 's leading rusher with 45 yards on six carries . Brown caught four passes for 80 yards , while Ginn had four receptions for 74 . Ealy was the top defensive performer for Carolina with four total tackles , three sacks , a forced fumble , a fumble recovery , and an interception . Defensive End Charles Johnson had four total tackles , a sack , and a forced fumble . Linebacker Luke Kuechly had 11 total tackles , while Thomas Davis had seven , despite playing just two weeks after breaking his right arm in the NFC title game .
Popular opinion remained firmly behind the celebration of Mary 's conception . In 1439 , the Council of Basel , which is not reckoned an ecumenical council , stated that belief in the immaculate conception of Mary is in accord with the Catholic faith . By the end of the 15th century the belief was widely professed and taught in many theological faculties , but such was the influence of the Dominicans , and the weight of the arguments of Thomas Aquinas ( who had been canonised in 1323 and declared " Doctor Angelicus " of the Church in 1567 ) that the Council of Trent ( 1545–63 ) —which might have been expected to affirm the doctrine—instead declined to take a position .
On 19 October 1512 , he was awarded his Doctor of Theology and , on 21 October 1512 , was received into the senate of the theological faculty of the University of Wittenberg , having been called to the position of Doctor in Bible . He spent the rest of his career in this position at the University of Wittenberg .
Luther 's writings circulated widely , reaching France , England , and Italy as early as 1519 . Students thronged to Wittenberg to hear Luther speak . He published a short commentary on Galatians and his Work on the Psalms . This early part of Luther 's career was one of his most creative and productive . Three of his best-known works were published in 1520 : To the Christian Nobility of the German Nation , On the Babylonian Captivity of the Church , and On the Freedom of a Christian .
The inclusiveness of Weinreich 's definition ( above ) directs attention to the totality of one 's identity at a given phase in time , and assists in elucidating component aspects of one 's total identity , such as one 's gender identity , ethnic identity , occupational identity and so on . The definition readily applies to the young child , to the adolescent , to the young adult , and to the older adult in various phases of the life cycle . Depending on whether one is a young child or an adult at the height of one 's powers , how one construes oneself as one was in the past will refer to very different salient experiential markers . Likewise , how one construes oneself as one aspires to be in the future will differ considerably according to one 's age and accumulated experiences . ( Weinreich & Saunderson , ( eds ) 2003 , pp 26–34 ) .
While the number of cardinals was small from the times of the Roman Empire to the Renaissance , and frequently smaller than the number of recognized churches entitled to a cardinal priest , in the 16th century the College expanded markedly . In 1587 , Pope Sixtus V sought to arrest this growth by fixing the maximum size of the College at 70 , including 50 cardinal priests , about twice the historical number . This limit was respected until 1958 , and the list of titular churches modified only on rare occasions , generally when a building fell into disrepair . When Pope John XXIII abolished the limit , he began to add new churches to the list , which Popes Paul VI and John Paul II continued to do . Today there are close to 150 titular churches , out of over 300 churches in Rome .
Luther devised the catechism as a method of imparting the basics of Christianity to the congregations . In 1529 , he wrote the Large Catechism , a manual for pastors and teachers , as well as a synopsis , the Small Catechism , to be memorised by the people themselves . The catechisms provided easy-to-understand instructional and devotional material on the Ten Commandments , the Apostles ' Creed , the Lord 's Prayer , baptism , and the Lord 's Supper . Luther incorporated questions and answers in the catechism so that the basics of Christian faith would not just be learned by rote , " the way monkeys do it " , but understood .
In 1983 the historic old town in the centre of Bern became a UNESCO World Heritage Site . Bern is ranked among the world ’ s top ten cities for the best quality of life ( 2010 ) .
The Suez Canal , built in partnership with the French , was completed in 1869 . Its construction led to enormous debt to European banks , and caused popular discontent because of the onerous taxation it required . In 1875 Ismail was forced to sell Egypt 's share in the canal to the British Government . Within three years this led to the imposition of British and French controllers who sat in the Egyptian cabinet , and , " with the financial power of the bondholders behind them , were the real power in the Government . "
Some established acts continued to enjoy commercial success , such as Aerosmith , with their number one multi-platinum albums : Get a Grip ( 1993 ) , which produced four Top 40 singles and became the band 's best-selling album worldwide ( going on to sell over 10 million copies ) , and Nine Lives ( 1997 ) . In 1998 , Aerosmith released the number one hit " I Do n't Want to Miss a Thing " , which remains the only single by a hard rock band to debut at number one . AC/DC produced the double platinum Ballbreaker ( 1995 ) . Bon Jovi appealed to their hard rock audience with songs such as " Keep the Faith " ( 1992 ) , but also achieved success in adult contemporary radio , with the Top 10 ballads " Bed of Roses " ( 1993 ) and " Always " ( 1994 ) . Bon Jovi 's 1995 album These Days was a bigger hit in Europe than it was in the United States , spawning four Top 10 singles on the UK Singles Chart . Metallica 's Load ( 1996 ) and ReLoad ( 1997 ) each sold in excess of 4 million copies in the US and saw the band develop a more melodic and blues rock sound . As the initial impetus of grunge bands faltered in the middle years of the decade , post-grunge bands emerged . They emulated the attitudes and music of grunge , particularly thick , distorted guitars , but with a more radio-friendly commercially oriented sound that drew more directly on traditional hard rock . Among the most successful acts were the Foo Fighters , Candlebox , Live , Collective Soul , Australia 's Silverchair and England 's Bush , who all cemented post-grunge as one of the most commercially viable subgenres by the late 1990s . Similarly , some post-Britpop bands that followed in the wake of Oasis , including Feeder and Stereophonics , adopted a hard rock or " pop-metal " sound .
As of 2015 , Bern 's City Council is made up of two representatives of the SP ( Social Democratic Party , of whom one is also the mayor ) , and one each of CVP ( Christian Democratic Party ) , GB ( Green Alliance of Berne ) , and FDP ( FDP.The Liberals ) , giving the left parties a majority of three out of five seats . The last election was held on 25 November 2012 .
The University of Bern , whose buildings are mainly located in the Länggasse quarter , is located in Bern , as well as the University of Applied Sciences ( Fachhochschule ) and several vocations schools .
Luther and his colleagues introduced the new order of worship during their visitation of the Electorate of Saxony , which began in 1527 . They also assessed the standard of pastoral care and Christian education in the territory . " Merciful God , what misery I have seen , " Luther wrote , " the common people knowing nothing at all of Christian doctrine ... and unfortunately many pastors are well-nigh unskilled and incapable of teaching . "
The city was originally built on a hilly peninsula surrounded by the River Aare , but outgrew natural boundaries by the 19th century . A number of bridges have been built to allow the city to expand beyond the Aare .
Approximately 12 million Africans were shipped to the Americas during the Atlantic slave trade from 1492 to 1888 , with 11.5 million of those shipped to South America and the Caribbean . Brazil was the largest importer in the Americas , with 5.5 million African slaves imported , followed by the British Caribbean with 2.76 million , the Spanish Caribbean and Spanish Mainland with 1.59 million Africans , and the French Caribbean with 1.32 million . Today their descendants number approximately 150 million in South America and the Caribbean . In addition to skin color , other physical characteristics such as facial features and hair texture are often variously used in classifying peoples as black in South America and the Caribbean . In South America and the Caribbean , classification as black is also closely tied to social status and socioeconomic variables , especially in light of social conceptions of " blanqueamiento " ( racial whitening ) and related concepts .
With Rivera having been a linebacker with the Chicago Bears in Super Bowl XX , and Kubiak replacing Elway at the end of the Broncos ' defeats in Super Bowls XXI and XXIV , this will be the first Super Bowl in which both head coaches played in the game themselves .
Some scholars have asserted that Luther taught that faith and reason were antithetical in the sense that questions of faith could not be illuminated by reason . He wrote , " All the articles of our Christian faith , which God has revealed to us in His Word , are in presence of reason sheerly impossible , absurd , and false . " and " [ That ] Reason in no way contributes to faith . [ ... ] For reason is the greatest enemy that faith has ; it never comes to the aid of spiritual things . " However , though seemingly contradictorily , he also wrote in the latter work that human reason " strives not against faith , when enlightened , but rather furthers and advances it " , bringing claims he was a fideist into dispute . Contemporary Lutheran scholarship , however , has found a different reality in Luther . Luther rather seeks to separate faith and reason in order to honor the separate spheres of knowledge that each applies to . Bernhard Lohse , for example , has demonstrated in his classic work " Fides und Ratio " that Luther ultimately sought to put the two together . More recently , Hans-Peter Grosshans has demonstrated that Luther 's work on Biblical Criticism stresses the need for external coherence in the right exegetical method . This means that for Luther it is more important that the Bible is reasonable according to the reality outside of the scriptures than that the Bible makes sense to itself , that it has internal coherence . The right tool for understanding the world outside of the Bible for Luther is none other than reason , which for him is the field of science , philosophy , history and empirical observation . Here a different picture is presented of a Luther who deeply valued both faith and reason , and held them in dialectical partnership . Luther 's concern thus in separating them is honoring their different epistemological spheres .
Zinc is a chemical element with symbol Zn and atomic number 30 . It is the first element of group 12 of the periodic table . In some respects zinc is chemically similar to magnesium : its ion is of similar size and its only common oxidation state is +2 . Zinc is the 24th most abundant element in Earth 's crust and has five stable isotopes . The most common zinc ore is sphalerite ( zinc blende ) , a zinc sulfide mineral . The largest mineable amounts are found in Australia , Asia , and the United States . Zinc production includes froth flotation of the ore , roasting , and final extraction using electricity ( electrowinning ) .
Due to the patriarchal nature of Arab society , Arab men , including during the slave trade in North Africa , enslaved more black women than men . They used more black female slaves in domestic service and agriculture than males . The men interpreted the Qur'an to permit sexual relations between a male master and his female slave outside of marriage ( see Ma malakat aymanukum and sex ) , leading to many mixed-race children . When an enslaved woman became pregnant with her Arab master 's child , she was considered as umm walad or " mother of a child " , a status that granted her privileged rights . The child was given rights of inheritance to the father 's property , so mixed-race children could share in any wealth of the father . Because the society was patrilineal , the children took their fathers ' social status at birth and were born free .
Zinc serves a purely structural role in zinc fingers , twists and clusters . Zinc fingers form parts of some transcription factors , which are proteins that recognize DNA base sequences during the replication and transcription of DNA . Each of the nine or ten Zn2+ ions in a zinc finger helps maintain the finger 's structure by coordinately binding to four amino acids in the transcription factor . The transcription factor wraps around the DNA helix and uses its fingers to accurately bind to the DNA sequence .
Cardinals elevated to the diaconal order are mainly officials of the Roman Curia holding various posts in the church administration . Their number and influence has varied through the years . While historically predominantly Italian the group has become much more internationally diverse in later years . While in 1939 about half were Italian by 1994 the number was reduced to one third . Their influence in the election of the Pope has been considered important , they are better informed and connected than the dislocated cardinals but their level of unity has been varied . Under the 1587 decree of Pope Sixtus V , which fixed the maximum size of the College of Cardinals , there were 14 cardinal deacons . Later the number increased . As late as 1939 almost half of the cardinals were members of the curia . Pius XII reduced this percentage to 24 percent . John XXIII brought it back up to 37 percent but Paul VI brought it down to 27 percent where John Paul II has maintained this ratio .
When Sky Digital was launched in 1998 the new service used the Astra 2A satellite which was located at the 28.5°E orbital position , unlike the analogue service which was broadcast from 19.2°E . This was subsequently followed by more Astra satellites as well as Eutelsat 's Eurobird 1 ( now Eutelsat 33C ) at 28.5°E ) , enabled the company to launch a new all-digital service , Sky , with the potential to carry hundreds of television and radio channels . The old position was shared with broadcasters from several European countries , while the new position at 28.5°E came to be used almost exclusively for channels that broadcast to the United Kingdom .
After a punt from both teams , Carolina got on track with a 9-play , 73-yard scoring drive . Newton completed 4 of 4 passes for 51 yards and rushed twice for 25 yards , while Jonathan Stewart finished the drive with a 1-yard touchdown run , cutting the score to 10–7 with 11:28 left in the second quarter . Later on , Broncos receiver Jordan Norwood received Brad Nortman 's short 28-yard punt surrounded by Panthers players , but none of them attempted to make a tackle , apparently thinking Norwood had called a fair catch . Norwood had not done so , and with no resistance around him , he took off for a Super Bowl record 61-yard return before Mario Addison dragged him down on the Panthers 14-yard line . Despite Denver 's excellent field position , they could not get the ball into the end zone , so McManus kicked a 33-yard field goal that increased their lead to 13–7 .
Manning finished the game 13 of 23 for 141 yards with one interception and zero touchdowns . Sanders was his top receiver with six receptions for 83 yards . Anderson was the game 's leading rusher with 90 yards and a touchdown , along with four receptions for 10 yards . Miller had six total tackles ( five solo ) , 2½ sacks , and two forced fumbles . Ware had five total tackles and two sacks . Ward had seven total tackles , a fumble recovery , and an interception . McManus made all four of his field goals , making him perfect on all 11 attempts during the post-season . Newton completed 18 of 41 passes for 265 yards , with one interception . He was also the team 's leading rusher with 45 yards on six carries . Brown caught four passes for 80 yards , while Ginn had four receptions for 74 . Ealy was the top defensive performer for Carolina with four total tackles , three sacks , a forced fumble , a fumble recovery , and an interception . Defensive End Charles Johnson had four total tackles , a sack , and a forced fumble . Linebacker Luke Kuechly had 11 total tackles , while Thomas Davis had seven , despite playing just two weeks after breaking his right arm in the NFC title game .
Pope Sixtus V limited the number of cardinals to 70 , comprising six cardinal bishops , 50 cardinal priests , and 14 cardinal deacons . Starting in the pontificate of Pope John XXIII , that limit has been exceeded . At the start of 1971 , Pope Paul VI set the number of cardinal electors at a maximum of 120 , but set no limit on the number of cardinals generally . He also established a maximum age of eighty years for electors . His action deprived twenty-five living cardinals , including the three living cardinals elevated by Pope Pius XI , of the right to participate in a conclave . [ citation needed ] Popes can dispense from church laws and have sometimes brought the number of cardinals under the age of 80 to more than 120 . Pope Paul VI also increased the number of cardinal bishops by giving that rank to patriarchs of the Eastern Catholic Churches .
There is disagreement about the origin of the term , but general consensus that " cardinalis " from the word cardo ( meaning 'pivot ' or 'hinge ' ) was first used in late antiquity to designate a bishop or priest who was incorporated into a church for which he had not originally been ordained . In Rome the first persons to be called cardinals were the deacons of the seven regions of the city at the beginning of the 6th century , when the word began to mean “ principal , ” “ eminent , ” or " superior . " The name was also given to the senior priest in each of the " title " churches ( the parish churches ) of Rome and to the bishops of the seven sees surrounding the city . By the 8th century the Roman cardinals constituted a privileged class among the Roman clergy . They took part in the administration of the church of Rome and in the papal liturgy . By decree of a synod of 769 , only a cardinal was eligible to become pope . In 1059 , during the pontificate of Nicholas II , cardinals were given the right to elect the pope under the Papal Bull In nomine Domini . For a time this power was assigned exclusively to the cardinal bishops , but the Third Lateran Council in 1179 gave back the right to the whole body of cardinals . Cardinals were granted the privilege of wearing the red hat by Pope Innocent IV in 1244 .
The Panthers seemed primed to score on their opening drive of the second half when Newton completed a 45-yard pass to Ted Ginn Jr. on the Denver 35-yard line on their second offensive play . But the Broncos defense halted the drive on the 26-yard line , and it ended with no points when Graham Gano hit the uprights on a 44-yard field goal attempt . After the miss , Manning completed a pair of passes to Emmanuel Sanders for gains of 25 and 22 yards , setting up McManus ' 33-yard field goal that gave the Broncos a 16–7 lead . Carolina got off to another strong start after the kickoff , with Newton completing a 42-yard pass to Corey Brown . But once again they came up empty , this time as a result of a Newton pass that bounced off the hands of Ginn and was intercepted by safety T. J . Ward . Ward fumbled the ball during the return , but Trevathan recovered it to enable Denver to keep possession .
Zinc ( I ) compounds are rare , and require bulky ligands to stabilize the low oxidation state . Most zinc ( I ) compounds contain formally the [ Zn2 ] 2+ core , which is analogous to the [ Hg2 ] 2+ dimeric cation present in mercury ( I ) compounds . The diamagnetic nature of the ion confirms its dimeric structure . The first zinc ( I ) compound containing the Zn—Zn bond , ( η5-C5Me5 ) 2Zn2 , is also the first dimetallocene . The [ Zn2 ] 2+ ion rapidly disproportionates into zinc metal and zinc ( II ) , and has only been obtained as a yellow glass formed by cooling a solution of metallic zinc in molten ZnCl2 .
In this work , one of his most emphatic statements on faith , he argued that every good work designed to attract God 's favor is a sin . All humans are sinners by nature , he explained , and God 's grace ( which can not be earned ) alone can make them just . On 1 August 1521 , Luther wrote to Melanchthon on the same theme : " Be a sinner , and let your sins be strong , but let your trust in Christ be stronger , and rejoice in Christ who is the victor over sin , death , and the world . We will commit sins while we are here , for this life is not a place where justice resides . "
The concept of blackness in the United States has been described as the degree to which one associates themselves with mainstream African-American culture , politics , and values . To a certain extent , this concept is not so much about race but more about political orientation , culture and behavior . Blackness can be contrasted with " acting white " , where black Americans are said to behave with assumed characteristics of stereotypical white Americans with regard to fashion , dialect , taste in music , and possibly , from the perspective of a significant number of black youth , academic achievement .
The City Parliament ( de : Stadtrat , fr : Conseil de ville ) holds legislative power . It is made up of 80 members , with elections held every four years . The City Parliament decrees regulations and by-laws that are executed by the City Council and the administration . The delegates are selected by means of a system of proportional representation .
Of the Christian minority in Egypt over 90 % belong to the native Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria , an Oriental Orthodox Christian Church . Other native Egyptian Christians are adherents of the Coptic Catholic Church , the Evangelical Church of Egypt and various other Protestant denominations . Non-native Christian communities are largely found in the urban regions of Cairo and Alexandria , such as the Syro-Lebanese , who belong to Greek Catholic , Greek Orthodox , and Maronite Catholic denominations .
The Dean of the College of Cardinals in addition to such a titular church also receives the titular bishopric of Ostia , the primary suburbicarian see . Cardinals governing a particular Church retain that church .
In his theses and disputations against the antinomians , Luther reviews and reaffirms , on the one hand , what has been called the " second use of the law , " that is , the law as the Holy Spirit 's tool to work sorrow over sin in man 's heart , thus preparing him for Christ 's fulfillment of the law offered in the gospel . Luther states that everything that is used to work sorrow over sin is called the law , even if it is Christ 's life , Christ 's death for sin , or God 's goodness experienced in creation . Simply refusing to preach the Ten Commandments among Christians – thereby , as it were , removing the three letters l-a-w from the church – does not eliminate the accusing law . Claiming that the law – in any form – should not be preached to Christians anymore would be tantamount to asserting that Christians are no longer sinners in themselves and that the church consists only of essentially holy people .
Carolina suffered a major setback when Thomas Davis , an 11-year veteran who had already overcome three ACL tears in his career , went down with a broken arm in the NFC Championship Game . Despite this , he insisted he would still find a way to play in the Super Bowl . His prediction turned out to be accurate .
In 1982 , the US Mint began minting pennies coated in copper but made primarily of zinc . With the new zinc pennies , there is the potential for zinc toxicosis , which can be fatal . One reported case of chronic ingestion of 425 pennies ( over 1 kg of zinc ) resulted in death due to gastrointestinal bacterial and fungal sepsis , whereas another patient , who ingested 12 grams of zinc , only showed lethargy and ataxia ( gross lack of coordination of muscle movements ) . Several other cases have been reported of humans suffering zinc intoxication by the ingestion of zinc coins .
Luther 's Commentary on Genesis contains a passage which concludes that " the soul does not sleep ( anima non sic dormit ) , but wakes ( sed vigilat ) and experiences visions " . Francis Blackburne in 1765 argued that John Jortin misread this and other passages from Luther , while Gottfried Fritschel pointed out in 1867 that it actually refers to the soul of a man " in this life " ( homo enim in hac vita ) tired from his daily labour ( defatigus diurno labore ) who at night enters his bedchamber ( sub noctem intrat in cubiculum suum ) and whose sleep is interrupted by dreams .
In 2004 , SME and Bertelsmann Music Group merged as Sony BMG Music Entertainment . When Sony acquired BMG 's half of the conglomerate in 2008 , Sony BMG reverted to the SME name . The buyout led to the dissolution of BMG , which then relaunched as BMG Rights Management . Out of the " Big Three " record companies , with Universal Music Group being the largest and Warner Music Group , SME is middle-sized .
As of 2010 [ update ] , Bern had an unemployment rate of 3.3 % . As of 2008 [ update ] , there were 259 people employed in the primary economic sector and about 59 businesses involved in this sector . 16,413 people were employed in the secondary sector and there were 950 businesses in this sector . 135,973 people were employed in the tertiary sector , with 7,654 businesses in this sector .
Constitutional changes voted on 19 March 2007 prohibited parties from using religion as a basis for political activity , allowed the drafting of a new anti-terrorism law , authorised broad police powers of arrest and surveillance , and gave the president power to dissolve parliament and end judicial election monitoring . In 2009 , Dr. Ali El Deen Hilal Dessouki , Media Secretary of the National Democratic Party ( NDP ) , described Egypt as a " pharaonic " political system , and democracy as a " long-term goal " . Dessouki also stated that " the real center of power in Egypt is the military " .
Possibly as early as the second century AD , Virgil 's works were seen as having magical properties and were used for divination . In what became known as the Sortes Vergilianae ( Virgilian Lots ) , passages would be selected at random and interpreted to answer questions . In the 12th century , starting around Naples but eventually spreading widely throughout Europe , a tradition developed in which Virgil was regarded as a great magician . Legends about Virgil and his magical powers remained popular for over two hundred years , arguably becoming as prominent as his writings themselves . Virgil 's legacy in medieval Wales was such that the Welsh version of his name , Fferyllt or Pheryllt , became a generic term for magic-worker , and survives in the modern Welsh word for pharmacist , fferyllydd .
Peyton Manning became the first quarterback ever to lead two different teams to multiple Super Bowls . He is also the oldest quarterback ever to play in a Super Bowl at age 39 . The past record was held by John Elway , who led the Broncos to victory in Super Bowl XXXIII at age 38 and is currently Denver 's Executive Vice President of Football Operations and General Manager .
Zinc metal is produced using extractive metallurgy . After grinding the ore , froth flotation , which selectively separates minerals from gangue by taking advantage of differences in their hydrophobicity , is used to get an ore concentrate . This concentrate consists of about 50 % zinc with the rest being sulfur ( 32 % ) , iron ( 13 % ) , and SiO 2 ( 5 % ) . The composition of this is normally zinc sulfide ( 80 % to 85 % ) , iron sulfide ( 7.0 % to 12 % ) , lead sulfide ( 3.0 % to 5.0 % ) silica ( 2.5 % to 3.5 % ) , and cadmium sulfide ( 0.35 % to 0.41 % ) .
From 2002 through 2008 , the Bush Administration denied funding to UNFPA that had already been allocated by the US Congress , partly on the refuted claims that the UNFPA supported Chinese government programs which include forced abortions and coercive sterilizations . In a letter from the Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Nicholas Burns to Congress , the administration said it had determined that UNFPA ’ s support for China ’ s population program “ facilitates ( its ) government ’ s coercive abortion program ” , thus violating the Kemp-Kasten Amendment , which bans the use of United States aid to finance organizations that support or take part in managing a program of coercive abortion of sterilization .
Luther had published his German translation of the New Testament in 1522 , and he and his collaborators completed the translation of the Old Testament in 1534 , when the whole Bible was published . He continued to work on refining the translation until the end of his life . Others had translated the Bible into German , but Luther tailored his translation to his own doctrine . When he was criticised for inserting the word " alone " after " faith " in Romans 3:28 , he replied in part : " [ T ] he text itself and the meaning of St. Paul urgently require and demand it . For in that very passage he is dealing with the main point of Christian doctrine , namely , that we are justified by faith in Christ without any works of the Law . ... But when works are so completely cut away – and that must mean that faith alone justifies – whoever would speak plainly and clearly about this cutting away of works will have to say , 'Faith alone justifies us , and not works ' . "
UNFPA is the world 's largest multilateral source of funding for population and reproductive health programs . The Fund works with governments and non-governmental organizations in over 150 countries with the support of the international community , supporting programs that help women , men and young people :

QuickBooks sponsored a " Small Business Big Game " contest , in which Death Wish Coffee had a 30-second commercial aired free of charge courtesy of QuickBooks . Death Wish Coffee beat out nine other contenders from across the United States for the free advertisement .
The game 's media day , which was typically held on the Tuesday afternoon prior to the game , was moved to the Monday evening and re-branded as Super Bowl Opening Night . The event was held on February 1 , 2016 at SAP Center in San Jose . Alongside the traditional media availabilities , the event featured an opening ceremony with player introductions on a replica of the Golden Gate Bridge .
Manning finished the year with a career-low 67.9 passer rating , throwing for 2,249 yards and nine touchdowns , with 17 interceptions . In contrast , Osweiler threw for 1,967 yards , 10 touchdowns and six interceptions for a rating of 86.4 . Veteran receiver Demaryius Thomas led the team with 105 receptions for 1,304 yards and six touchdowns , while Emmanuel Sanders caught 76 passes for 1,135 yards and six scores , while adding another 106 yards returning punts . Tight end Owen Daniels was also a big element of the passing game with 46 receptions for 517 yards . Running back C. J. Anderson was the team 's leading rusher 863 yards and seven touchdowns , while also catching 25 passes for 183 yards . Running back Ronnie Hillman also made a big impact with 720 yards , five touchdowns , 24 receptions , and a 4.7 yards per carry average . Overall , the offense ranked 19th in scoring with 355 points and did not have any Pro Bowl selections .
A number of congresses of the socialist First and Second Internationals were held in Bern , particularly during World War I when Switzerland was neutral ; see Bern International .
The service started on 1 September 1993 based on the idea from the then chief executive officer , Sam Chisholm and Rupert Murdoch , of converting the company business strategy to an entirely fee-based concept . The new package included four channels formerly available free-to-air , broadcasting on Astra 's satellites , as well as introducing new channels . The service continued until the closure of BSkyB 's analogue service on 27 September 2001 , due to the launch and expansion of the Sky Digital platform . Some of the channels did broadcast either in the clear or soft encrypted ( whereby a Videocrypt decoder was required to decode , without a subscription card ) prior to their addition to the Sky Multichannels package . Within two months of the launch , BSkyB gained 400,000 new subscribers , with the majority taking at least one premium channel as well , which helped BSkyB reach 3.5 million households by mid-1994 . Michael Grade criticized the operations in front of the Select Committee on National Heritage , mainly for the lack of original programming on many of the new channels .
The biographical tradition asserts that Virgil began the hexameter Eclogues ( or Bucolics ) in 42 BC and it is thought that the collection was published around 39–38 BC , although this is controversial . The Eclogues ( from the Greek for " selections " ) are a group of ten poems roughly modeled on the bucolic hexameter poetry ( " pastoral poetry " ) of the Hellenistic poet Theocritus . After his victory in the Battle of Philippi in 42 BC , fought against the army led by the assassins of Julius Caesar , Octavian tried to pay off his veterans with land expropriated from towns in northern Italy , supposedly including , according to the tradition , an estate near Mantua belonging to Virgil . The loss of his family farm and the attempt through poetic petitions to regain his property have traditionally been seen as Virgil 's motives in the composition of the Eclogues . This is now thought to be an unsupported inference from interpretations of the Eclogues . In Eclogues 1 and 9 , Virgil indeed dramatizes the contrasting feelings caused by the brutality of the land expropriations through pastoral idiom , but offers no indisputable evidence of the supposed biographic incident . While some readers have identified the poet himself with various characters and their vicissitudes , whether gratitude by an old rustic to a new god ( Ecl . 1 ) , frustrated love by a rustic singer for a distant boy ( his master 's pet , Ecl . 2 ) , or a master singer 's claim to have composed several eclogues ( Ecl . 5 ) , modern scholars largely reject such efforts to garner biographical details from works of fiction , preferring to interpret an author 's characters and themes as illustrations of contemporary life and thought . The ten Eclogues present traditional pastoral themes with a fresh perspective . Eclogues 1 and 9 address the land confiscations and their effects on the Italian countryside . 2 and 3 are pastoral and erotic , discussing both homosexual love ( Ecl . 2 ) and attraction toward people of any gender ( Ecl . 3 ) . Eclogue 4 , addressed to Asinius Pollio , the so-called " Messianic Eclogue " uses the imagery of the golden age in connection with the birth of a child ( who the child was meant to be has been subject to debate ) . 5 and 8 describe the myth of Daphnis in a song contest , 6 , the cosmic and mythological song of Silenus ; 7 , a heated poetic contest , and 10 the sufferings of the contemporary elegiac poet Cornelius Gallus . Virgil is credited [ by whom ? ] in the Eclogues with establishing Arcadia as a poetic ideal that still resonates in Western literature and visual arts and setting the stage for the development of Latin pastoral by Calpurnius Siculus , Nemesianus , and later writers .
In 1965 , Pope Paul VI decreed in his motu proprio Ad Purpuratorum Patrum that patriarchs of the Eastern Catholic Churches who were named cardinals ( i.e. , patriarch cardinals ) would also be part of the episcopal order , ranking after the six cardinal bishops of the suburbicarian sees ( who had been relieved of direct responsibilities for those sees by Pope John XXIII three years earlier ) . Patriarch cardinals do not receive title of a suburbicarian see , and as such they can not elect the dean or become dean . There are currently three Eastern Patriarchs who are cardinal bishops :
In cities other than Rome , the name cardinal began to be applied to certain church men as a mark of honour . The earliest example of this occurs in a letter sent by Pope Zacharias in 747 to Pippin III ( the Short ) , ruler of the Franks , in which Zacharias applied the title to the priests of Paris to distinguish them from country clergy . This meaning of the word spread rapidly , and from the 9th century various episcopal cities had a special class among the clergy known as cardinals . The use of the title was reserved for the cardinals of Rome in 1567 by Pius V .
The Panthers offense , which led the NFL in scoring ( 500 points ) , was loaded with talent , boasting six Pro Bowl selections . Pro Bowl quarterback Cam Newton had one of his best seasons , throwing for 3,837 yards and rushing for 636 , while recording a career-high and league-leading 45 total touchdowns ( 35 passing , 10 rushing ) , a career-low 10 interceptions , and a career-best quarterback rating of 99.4 . Newton 's leading receivers were tight end Greg Olsen , who caught a career-high 77 passes for 1,104 yards and seven touchdowns , and wide receiver Ted Ginn , Jr. , who caught 44 passes for 739 yards and 10 touchdowns ; Ginn also rushed for 60 yards and returned 27 punts for 277 yards . Other key receivers included veteran Jerricho Cotchery ( 39 receptions for 485 yards ) , rookie Devin Funchess ( 31 receptions for 473 yards and five touchdowns ) , and second-year receiver Corey Brown ( 31 receptions for 447 yards ) . The Panthers backfield featured Pro Bowl running back Jonathan Stewart , who led the team with 989 rushing yards and six touchdowns in 13 games , along with Pro Bowl fullback Mike Tolbert , who rushed for 256 yards and caught 18 passes for another 154 yards . Carolina 's offensive line also featured two Pro Bowl selections : center Ryan Kalil and guard Trai Turner .
Indigenous Australians have been referred to as " black people " in Australia since the early days of European settlement . While originally related to skin colour , the term is used to today to indicate Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander ancestry in general and can refer to people of any skin pigmentation .
Gender identity forms an important part of identity in psychology , as it dictates to a significant degree how one views oneself both as a person and in relation to other people , ideas and nature . Other aspects of identity , such as racial , religious , ethnic , occupational… etc . may also be more or less significant – or significant in some situations but not in others ( Weinreich & Saunderson 2003 pp26–34 ) . In cognitive psychology , the term " identity " refers to the capacity for self-reflection and the awareness of self . ( Leary & Tangney 2003 , p. 3 )
On 31 October 1517 , Luther wrote to his bishop , Albert of Mainz , protesting the sale of indulgences . He enclosed in his letter a copy of his " Disputation of Martin Luther on the Power and Efficacy of Indulgences " , which came to be known as The Ninety-Five Theses . Hans Hillerbrand writes that Luther had no intention of confronting the church , but saw his disputation as a scholarly objection to church practices , and the tone of the writing is accordingly " searching , rather than doctrinaire . " Hillerbrand writes that there is nevertheless an undercurrent of challenge in several of the theses , particularly in Thesis 86 , which asks : " Why does the pope , whose wealth today is greater than the wealth of the richest Crassus , build the basilica of St. Peter with the money of poor believers rather than with his own money ? "
Bern was a candidate to host the 2010 Winter Olympics , but withdrew its bid in September 2002 after a referendum was passed that showed that the bid was not supported by locals . Those games were eventually awarded to Vancouver , Canada .
The structure known as " Virgil 's tomb " is found at the entrance of an ancient Roman tunnel ( also known as " grotta vecchia " ) in Piedigrotta , a district two miles from the centre of Naples , near the Mergellina harbor , on the road heading north along the coast to Pozzuoli . While Virgil was already the object of literary admiration and veneration before his death , in the Middle Ages his name became associated with miraculous powers , and for a couple of centuries his tomb was the destination of pilgrimages and veneration .
Roughly one quarter of all zinc output in the United States ( 2009 ) , is consumed in the form of zinc compounds ; a variety of which are used industrially . Zinc oxide is widely used as a white pigment in paints , and as a catalyst in the manufacture of rubber . It is also used as a heat disperser for the rubber and acts to protect its polymers from ultraviolet radiation ( the same UV protection is conferred to plastics containing zinc oxide ) . The semiconductor properties of zinc oxide make it useful in varistors and photocopying products . The zinc zinc-oxide cycle is a two step thermochemical process based on zinc and zinc oxide for hydrogen production .
Critics note that people of color have limited media visibility . The Brazilian media has been accused of hiding or overlooking the nation 's Black , Indigenous , Multiracial and East Asian populations . For example , the telenovelas or soaps are criticized for featuring actors who resemble northern Europeans rather than actors of the more prevalent Southern European features ) and light-skinned mulatto and mestizo appearance . ( Pardos may achieve " white " status if they have attained the middle-class or higher social status ) .
Mary 's complete sinlessness and concomitant exemption from any taint from the first moment of her existence was a doctrine familiar to Greek theologians of Byzantium . Beginning with St. Gregory Nazianzen , his explanation of the " purification " of Jesus and Mary at the circumcision ( Luke 2:22 ) prompted him to consider the primary meaning of " purification " in Christology ( and by extension in Mariology ) to refer to a perfectly sinless nature that manifested itself in glory in a moment of grace ( e.g. , Jesus at his Baptism ) . St. Gregory Nazianzen designated Mary as " prokathartheisa ( prepurified ) . " Gregory likely attempted to solve the riddle of the Purification of Jesus and Mary in the Temple through considering the human natures of Jesus and Mary as equally holy and therefore both purified in this manner of grace and glory . Gregory 's doctrines surrounding Mary 's purification were likely related to the burgeoning commemoration of the Mother of God in and around Constantinople very close to the date of Christmas . Nazianzen 's title of Mary at the Annunciation as " prepurified " was subsequently adopted by all theologians interested in his Mariology to justify the Byzantine equivalent of the Immaculate Conception . This is especially apparent in the Fathers St. Sophronios of Jerusalem and St. John Damascene , who will be treated below in this article at the section on Church Fathers . About the time of Damascene , the public celebration of the " Conception of St. Ann [ i.e. , of the Theotokos in her womb ] " was becoming popular . After this period , the " purification " of the perfect natures of Jesus and Mary would not only mean moments of grace and glory at the Incarnation and Baptism and other public Byzantine liturgical feasts , but purification was eventually associated with the feast of Mary 's very conception ( along with her Presentation in the Temple as a toddler ) by Orthodox authors of the 2nd millennium ( e.g. , St. Nicholas Cabasilas and Joseph Bryennius ) .
Although the doctrine of Mary 's Immaculate Conception appears only later among Latin ( and particularly Frankish ) theologians , it became ever more manifest among Byzantine theologians reliant on Gregory Nazianzen 's Mariology in the Medieval or Byzantine East . Although hymnographers and scholars , like the Emperor Justinian I , were accustomed to call Mary " prepurified " in their poetic and credal statements , the first point of departure for more fully commenting on Nazianzen 's meaning occurs in Sophronius of Jerusalem . In other places Sophronius explains that the Theotokos was already immaculate , when she was " purified " at the Annunciation and goes so far as to note that John the Baptist is literally " holier than all 'Men ' born of woman " since Mary 's surpassing holiness signifies that she was holier than even John after his sanctification in utero . Sophronius ' teaching is augmented and incorporated by St. John Damascene ( d. 749/750 ) . John , besides many passages wherein he extolls the Theotokos for her purification at the Annunciation , grants her the unique honor of " purifying the waters of baptism by touching them . " This honor was most famously and firstly attributed to Christ , especially in the legacy of Nazianzen . As such , Nazianzen 's assertion of parallel holiness between the prepurified Mary and purified Jesus of the New Testament is made even more explicit in Damascene in his discourse on Mary 's holiness to also imitate Christ 's baptism at the Jordan . The Damascene 's hymnongraphy and De fide Orthodoxa explicitly use Mary 's " pre purification " as a key to understanding her absolute holiness and unsullied human nature . In fact , Damascene ( along with Nazianzen ) serves as the source for nearly all subsequent promotion of Mary 's complete holiness from her Conception by the " all pure seed " of Joachim and the womb " wider than heaven " of St. Ann .
Hard rock is a form of loud , aggressive rock music . The electric guitar is often emphasised , used with distortion and other effects , both as a rhythm instrument using repetitive riffs with a varying degree of complexity , and as a solo lead instrument . Drumming characteristically focuses on driving rhythms , strong bass drum and a backbeat on snare , sometimes using cymbals for emphasis . The bass guitar works in conjunction with the drums , occasionally playing riffs , but usually providing a backing for the rhythm and lead guitars . Vocals are often growling , raspy , or involve screaming or wailing , sometimes in a high range , or even falsetto voice .
Each cardinal takes on a titular church , either a church in the city of Rome or one of the suburbicarian sees . The only exception is for patriarchs of Eastern Catholic Churches . Nevertheless , cardinals possess no power of governance nor are they to intervene in any way in matters which pertain to the administration of goods , discipline , or the service of their titular churches . They are allowed to celebrate Mass and hear confessions and lead visits and pilgrimages to their titular churches , in coordination with the staff of the church . They often support their churches monetarily , and many Cardinals do keep in contact with the pastoral staffs of their titular churches .
Zinc is a chemical element with symbol Zn and atomic number 30 . It is the first element of group 12 of the periodic table . In some respects zinc is chemically similar to magnesium : its ion is of similar size and its only common oxidation state is +2 . Zinc is the 24th most abundant element in Earth 's crust and has five stable isotopes . The most common zinc ore is sphalerite ( zinc blende ) , a zinc sulfide mineral . The largest mineable amounts are found in Australia , Asia , and the United States . Zinc production includes froth flotation of the ore , roasting , and final extraction using electricity ( electrowinning ) .
Manning finished the year with a career-low 67.9 passer rating , throwing for 2,249 yards and nine touchdowns , with 17 interceptions . In contrast , Osweiler threw for 1,967 yards , 10 touchdowns and six interceptions for a rating of 86.4 . Veteran receiver Demaryius Thomas led the team with 105 receptions for 1,304 yards and six touchdowns , while Emmanuel Sanders caught 76 passes for 1,135 yards and six scores , while adding another 106 yards returning punts . Tight end Owen Daniels was also a big element of the passing game with 46 receptions for 517 yards . Running back C. J. Anderson was the team 's leading rusher 863 yards and seven touchdowns , while also catching 25 passes for 183 yards . Running back Ronnie Hillman also made a big impact with 720 yards , five touchdowns , 24 receptions , and a 4.7 yards per carry average . Overall , the offense ranked 19th in scoring with 355 points and did not have any Pro Bowl selections .
While BSkyB had been excluded from being a part of the ONdigital consortium , thereby making them a competitor by default , BSkyB was able to join ITV Digital 's free-to-air replacement , Freeview , in which it holds an equal stake with the BBC , ITV , Channel 4 and National Grid Wireless . Prior to October 2005 , three BSkyB channels were available on this platform : Sky News , Sky Three , and Sky Sports News . Initially BSkyB provided Sky Travel to the service . However , this was replaced by Sky Three on 31 October 2005 , which was itself later re-branded as 'Pick TV ' in 2011 .
ARC was acquired in 1938 by the Columbia Broadcasting System ( CBS , which , in turn , had been formed by the Columbia Phonograph Company , but then sold off ) . ARC was renamed Columbia Recording Corporation . The Columbia Phonograph Company had international subsidiaries and affiliates such as the Columbia Graphophone Company in the United Kingdom , but they were sold off prior to CBS acquiring American Columbia . RCA Victor Records executive Ted Wallerstein convinced CBS head William S. Paley to buy ARC and Paley made Wallerstein head of the newly acquired record company . The renamed company made Columbia its flagship label with Okeh its subsidiary label while deemphasizing ARC 's other labels . This allowed ARC 's leased labels Brunswick Records and Vocalion Records to revert to former owner Warner Bros. which sold the labels to Decca Records . Columbia kept the Brunswick catalogue recorded from December 1931 onward which was reissued on the Columbia label as well as the Vocalion label material from the same time period which was reissued on the Okeh label . Wallerstein , who was promoted at the end of 1947 from president to chairman of the record company , restored Columbia 's status as a leading record company and spearheaded the successful introduction of the long playing ( LP ) record before he retired as Columbia 's chairman in 1951 . James Conkling then became head of Columbia Records . Also in 1951 , Columbia severed its ties with the EMI-owned record label of the same name and began a UK distribution deal with Philips Records , whereas Okeh Records continued to be distributed by EMI on the Columbia label .
The plan stated that the following numbers of species of different groups had been recorded from Egypt : algae ( 1483 species ) , animals ( about 15,000 species of which more than 10,000 were insects ) , fungi ( more than 627 species ) , monera ( 319 species ) , plants ( 2426 species ) , protozoans ( 371 species ) . For some major groups , for example lichen-forming fungi and nematode worms , the number was not known . Apart from small and well-studied groups like amphibians , birds , fish , mammals and reptiles , the many of those numbers are likely to increase as further species are recorded from Egypt . For the fungi , including lichen-forming species , for example , subsequent work has shown that over 2200 species have been recorded from Egypt , and the final figure of all fungi actually occurring in the country is expected to be much higher .
The legend of Virgil in his Basket arose in the Middle Ages , and is often seen in art and mentioned in literature as part of the Power of Women literary topos , demonstrating the disruptive force of female attractiveness on men . In this story Virgil became enamoured of a beautiful woman , sometimes described as the emperor 's daughter or mistress and called Lucretia . She played him along and agreed to an assignation at her house , which he was to sneak into at night by climbing into a large basket let down from a window . When he did so he was only hoisted halfway up the wall and then left him trapped there into the next day , exposed to public ridicule . The story paralleled that of Phyllis riding Aristotle . Among other artists depicting the scene , Lucas van Leyden made a woodcut and later an engraving .
The term cardinal at one time applied to any priest permanently assigned or incardinated to a church , or specifically to the senior priest of an important church , based on the Latin cardo ( hinge ) , meaning " principal " or " chief " . The term was applied in this sense as early as the ninth century to the priests of the tituli ( parishes ) of the diocese of Rome . The Church of England retains an instance of this origin of the title , which is held by the two senior members of the College of Minor Canons of St Paul 's Cathedral .
While the incumbents of some sees are regularly made cardinals , and some countries are entitled to at least one cardinal by concordate ( usually earning its primate the cardinal 's hat ) , no see carries an actual right to the cardinalate , not even if its bishop is a Patriarch .
Luther 's writings circulated widely , reaching France , England , and Italy as early as 1519 . Students thronged to Wittenberg to hear Luther speak . He published a short commentary on Galatians and his Work on the Psalms . This early part of Luther 's career was one of his most creative and productive . Three of his best-known works were published in 1520 : To the Christian Nobility of the German Nation , On the Babylonian Captivity of the Church , and On the Freedom of a Christian .
The canal is 193.30 km ( 120.11 mi ) long , 24 m ( 79 ft ) deep and 205 metres ( 673 ft ) wide as of 2010 . It consists of the northern access channel of 22 km ( 14 mi ) , the canal itself of 162.25 km ( 100.82 mi ) and the southern access channel of 9 km ( 5.6 mi ) . The canal is a single lane with passing places in the " Ballah By-Pass " and the Great Bitter Lake . It contains no locks ; seawater flows freely through the canal . In general , the canal north of the Bitter Lakes flows north in winter and south in summer . The current south of the lakes changes with the tide at Suez .
No archaeological evidence that indicates a settlement on the site of today′s city centre prior to the 12th century has been found so far . In antiquity , a Celtic oppidum stood on the Engehalbinsel ( peninsula ) north of Bern , fortified since the 2nd century BC ( late La Tène period ) , thought to be one of the twelve oppida of the Helvetii mentioned by Caesar . During the Roman era , there was a Gallo-Roman vicus on the same site . The Bern zinc tablet has the name Brenodor ( " dwelling of Breno " ) . In the Early Middle Ages , there was a settlement in Bümpliz , now a city district of Bern , some 4 km ( 2 mi ) from the medieval city .
Westwood One will carry the game throughout North America , with Kevin Harlan as play-by-play announcer , Boomer Esiason and Dan Fouts as color analysts , and James Lofton and Mark Malone as sideline reporters . Jim Gray will anchor the pre-game and halftime coverage .
The enforcement of the ban on the 95 Theses fell to the secular authorities . On 18 April 1521 , Luther appeared as ordered before the Diet of Worms . This was a general assembly of the estates of the Holy Roman Empire that took place in Worms , a town on the Rhine . It was conducted from 28 January to 25 May 1521 , with Emperor Charles V presiding . Prince Frederick III , Elector of Saxony , obtained a safe conduct for Luther to and from the meeting .
On 28 February 1476 , Pope Sixtus IV , authorized those dioceses that wished to introduce the feast to do so , and introduced it to his own diocese of Rome in 1477 , with a specially composed Mass and Office of the feast . With his bull Cum praeexcelsa of 28 February 1477 , in which he referred to the feast as that of the Conception of Mary , without using the word " Immaculate " , he granted indulgences to those who would participate in the specially composed Mass or Office on the feast itself or during its octave , and he used the word " immaculate " of Mary , but applied instead the adjective " miraculous " to her conception . On 4 September 1483 , referring to the feast as that of " the Conception of Immaculate Mary ever Virgin " , he condemned both those who called it mortally sinful and heretical to hold that the " glorious and immaculate mother of God was conceived without the stain of original sin " and those who called it mortally sinful and heretical to hold that " the glorious Virgin Mary was conceived with original sin " , since , he said , " up to this time there has been no decision made by the Roman Church and the Apostolic See . " This decree was reaffirmed by the Council of Trent .
The Panthers defense gave up just 308 points , ranking sixth in the league , while also leading the NFL in interceptions with 24 and boasting four Pro Bowl selections . Pro Bowl defensive tackle Kawann Short led the team in sacks with 11 , while also forcing three fumbles and recovering two . Fellow lineman Mario Addison added 6½ sacks . The Panthers line also featured veteran defensive end Jared Allen , a 5-time pro bowler who was the NFL 's active career sack leader with 136 , along with defensive end Kony Ealy , who had 5 sacks in just 9 starts . Behind them , two of the Panthers three starting linebackers were also selected to play in the Pro Bowl : Thomas Davis and Luke Kuechly . Davis compiled 5½ sacks , four forced fumbles , and four interceptions , while Kuechly led the team in tackles ( 118 ) forced two fumbles , and intercepted four passes of his own . Carolina 's secondary featured Pro Bowl safety Kurt Coleman , who led the team with a career high seven interceptions , while also racking up 88 tackles and Pro Bowl cornerback Josh Norman , who developed into a shutdown corner during the season and had four interceptions , two of which were returned for touchdowns .

Following their loss in the divisional round of the previous season 's playoffs , the Denver Broncos underwent numerous coaching changes , including a mutual parting with head coach John Fox ( who had won four divisional championships in his four years as Broncos head coach ) , and the hiring of Gary Kubiak as the new head coach . Under Kubiak , the Broncos planned to install a run-oriented offense with zone blocking to blend in with quarterback Peyton Manning 's shotgun passing skills , but struggled with numerous changes and injuries to the offensive line , as well as Manning having his worst statistical season since his rookie year with the Indianapolis Colts in 1998 , due to a plantar fasciitis injury in his heel that he had suffered since the summer , and the simple fact that Manning was getting old , as he turned 39 in the 2015 off-season . Although the team had a 7–0 start , Manning led the NFL in interceptions . In week 10 , Manning suffered a partial tear of the plantar fasciitis in his left foot . He set the NFL 's all-time record for career passing yards in this game , but was benched after throwing four interceptions in favor of backup quarterback Brock Osweiler , who took over as the starter for most of the remainder of the regular season . Osweiler was injured , however , leading to Manning 's return during the Week 17 regular season finale , where the Broncos were losing 13–7 against the 4–11 San Diego Chargers , resulting in Manning re-claiming the starting quarterback position for the playoffs by leading the team to a key 27–20 win that enabled the team to clinch the number one overall AFC seed . Under defensive coordinator Wade Phillips , the Broncos ' defense ranked number one in total yards allowed , passing yards allowed and sacks , and like the previous three seasons , the team has continued to set numerous individual , league and franchise records . With the defense carrying the team despite the issues with the offense , the Broncos finished the regular season with a 12–4 record and earned home-field advantage throughout the AFC playoffs .
Luther 's other major works on the Jews were his 60,000-word treatise Von den Juden und Ihren Lügen ( On the Jews and Their Lies ) , and Vom Schem Hamphoras und vom Geschlecht Christi ( On the Holy Name and the Lineage of Christ ) , both published in 1543 , three years before his death . Luther argued that the Jews were no longer the chosen people but " the devil 's people " , and referred to them with violent , vile language . Citing Deuteronomy 13 , wherein Moses commands the killing of idolaters and the burning of their cities and property as an offering to God , Luther called for a " scharfe Barmherzigkeit " ( " sharp mercy " ) against the Jews " to see whether we might save at least a few from the glowing flames . " Luther advocated setting synagogues on fire , destroying Jewish prayerbooks , forbidding rabbis from preaching , seizing Jews ' property and money , and smashing up their homes , so that these " envenomed worms " would be forced into labour or expelled " for all time " . In Robert Michael 's view , Luther 's words " We are at fault in not slaying them " amounted to a sanction for murder . " God 's anger with them is so intense , " Luther concluded , " that gentle mercy will only tend to make them worse , while sharp mercy will reform them but little . Therefore , in any case , away with them ! "
There would be no more scoring in the third quarter , but early in the fourth , the Broncos drove to the Panthers 41-yard line . On the next play , Ealy knocked the ball out of Manning 's hand as he was winding up for a pass , and then recovered it for Carolina on the 50-yard line . A 16-yard reception by Devin Funchess and a 12-yard run by Stewart then set up Gano 's 39-yard field goal , cutting the Panthers deficit to one score at 16–10 . The next three drives of the game would end in punts .
In 1501 , at the age of 19 , he entered the University of Erfurt , which he later described as a beerhouse and whorehouse . He was made to wake at four every morning for what has been described as " a day of rote learning and often wearying spiritual exercises . " He received his master 's degree in 1505 .
BSkyB 's digital service was officially launched on 1 October 1998 under the name Sky Digital , although small-scale tests were carried out before then . At this time the use of the Sky Digital brand made an important distinction between the new service and Sky 's analogue services . Key selling points were the improvement in picture and sound quality , increased number of channels and an interactive service branded Open ... . now called Sky Active , BSkyB competed with the ONdigital ( later ITV Digital ) terrestrial offering and cable services . Within 30 days , over 100,000 digiboxes had been sold , which help bolstered BSkyB 's decision to give away free digiboxes and minidishes from May 1999 .
As a result of modernisation efforts over the years , Egypt 's healthcare system has made great strides forward . Access to healthcare in both urban and rural areas greatly improved and immunisation programs are now able to cover 98 % of the population . Life expectancy increased from 44.8 years during the 1960s to 72.12 years in 2009 . There was a noticeable decline of the infant mortality rate ( during the 1970s to the 1980s the infant mortality rate was 101-132/1000 live births , in 2000 the rate was 50-60/1000 , and in 2008 it was 28-30/1000 ) .
Egypt 's most prominent multinational companies are the Orascom Group and Raya Contact Center . The information technology ( IT ) sector has expanded rapidly in the past few years , with many start-ups selling outsourcing services to North America and Europe , operating with companies such as Microsoft , Oracle and other major corporations , as well as many small and medium size enterprises . Some of these companies are the Xceed Contact Center , Raya , E Group Connections and C3 . The IT sector has been stimulated by new Egyptian entrepreneurs with government encouragement .

With 4:51 left in regulation , Carolina got the ball on their own 24-yard line with a chance to mount a game-winning drive , and soon faced 3rd-and-9 . On the next play , Miller stripped the ball away from Newton , and after several players dove for it , it took a long bounce backwards and was recovered by Ward , who returned it five yards to the Panthers 4-yard line . Although several players dove into the pile to attempt to recover it , Newton did not and his lack of aggression later earned him heavy criticism . Meanwhile , Denver 's offense was kept out of the end zone for three plays , but a holding penalty on cornerback Josh Norman gave the Broncos a new set of downs . Then Anderson scored on a 2-yard touchdown run and Manning completed a pass to Bennie Fowler for a 2-point conversion , giving Denver a 24–10 lead with 3:08 left and essentially putting the game away . Carolina had two more drives , but failed to get a first down on each one .
In the US , African Americans , who include multiracial people , earn 75 % of what white people earn . In Brazil , people of color earn less than 50 % of what whites earn . Some have posited that the facts of lower socioeconomic status for people of color suggest that Brazil practices a kind of one-drop rule , or discrimination against people who are not visibly European in ancestry . The gap in income between blacks and other non-whites is relatively small compared to the large gap between whites and all people of color . Other social factors , such as illiteracy and education levels , show the same patterns of disadvantage for people of color . Some commentators observe that the United States practice of segregation and white supremacy in the South , and discrimination in many areas outside that region , forced many African Americans to unite in the civil rights struggle . They suggest that the fluid nature of race in Brazil has divided individuals of African descent , between those with more or less ancestry . As a result , they have not united for a stronger civil rights movement . [ citation needed ]
UNFPA is the world 's largest multilateral source of funding for population and reproductive health programs . The Fund works with governments and non-governmental organizations in over 150 countries with the support of the international community , supporting programs that help women , men and young people :
In addition , there are $ 2 million worth of other ancillary events , including a week-long event at the Santa Clara Convention Center , a beer , wine and food festival at Bellomy Field at Santa Clara University , and a pep rally . A professional fundraiser will aid in finding business sponsors and individual donors , but still may need the city council to help fund the event . Additional funding will be provided by the city council , which has announced plans to set aside seed funding for the event .
The Georgics ' tone wavers between optimism and pessimism , sparking critical debate on the poet 's intentions , but the work lays the foundations for later didactic poetry . Virgil and Maecenas are said to have taken turns reading the Georgics to Octavian upon his return from defeating Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC .
Other major bluegrass mandolinists who emerged in the early 1950s and are still active include Jesse McReynolds ( of Jim and Jesse ) who invented a syncopated banjo-roll-like style called crosspicking—and Bobby Osborne of the Osborne Brothers , who is a master of clarity and sparkling single-note runs . Highly respected and influential modern bluegrass players include Herschel Sizemore , Doyle Lawson , and the multi-genre Sam Bush , who is equally at home with old-time fiddle tunes , rock , reggae , and jazz . Ronnie McCoury of the Del McCoury Band has won numerous awards for his Monroe-influenced playing . The late John Duffey of the original Country Gentlemen and later the Seldom Scene did much to popularize the bluegrass mandolin among folk and urban audiences , especially on the east coast and in the Washington , D.C. area .
Archbishop Albrecht of Mainz and Magdeburg did not reply to Luther 's letter containing the 95 Theses . He had the theses checked for heresy and in December 1517 forwarded them to Rome . He needed the revenue from the indulgences to pay off a papal dispensation for his tenure of more than one bishopric . As Luther later noted , " the pope had a finger in the pie as well , because one half was to go to the building of St Peter 's Church in Rome " .
With Rivera having been a linebacker with the Chicago Bears in Super Bowl XX , and Kubiak replacing Elway at the end of the Broncos ' defeats in Super Bowls XXI and XXIV , this will be the first Super Bowl in which both head coaches played in the game themselves .
The concept of race in Brazil is complex . A Brazilian child was never automatically identified with the racial type of one or both of his or her parents , nor were there only two categories to choose from . Between an individual of unmixed West African descent and a very light mulatto individual , more than a dozen racial categories were acknowledged , based on various combinations of hair color , hair texture , eye color , and skin color . These types grade into each other like the colors of the spectrum , and no one category stands significantly isolated from the rest . In Brazil , people are classified by appearance , not heredity .
Several dozen radioisotopes have been characterized . 65Zn , which has a half-life of 243.66 days , is the most long-lived radioisotope , followed by 72Zn with a half-life of 46.5 hours . Zinc has 10 nuclear isomers . 69mZn has the longest half-life , 13.76 h. The superscript m indicates a metastable isotope . The nucleus of a metastable isotope is in an excited state and will return to the ground state by emitting a photon in the form of a gamma ray . 61Zn has three excited states and 73Zn has two . The isotopes 65Zn , 71Zn , 77Zn and 78Zn each have only one excited state .
His last sermon was delivered at Eisleben , his place of birth , on 15 February 1546 , three days before his death . It was " entirely devoted to the obdurate Jews , whom it was a matter of great urgency to expel from all German territory , " according to Léon Poliakov . James Mackinnon writes that it concluded with a " fiery summons to drive the Jews bag and baggage from their midst , unless they desisted from their calumny and their usury and became Christians . " Luther said , " we want to practice Christian love toward them and pray that they convert , " but also that they are " our public enemies ... and if they could kill us all , they would gladly do so . And so often they do . "
Noteworthy Irish mandolinists include Andy Irvine ( who , like Johnny Moynihan , almost always tunes the top E down to D , to achieve an open tuning of GDAD ) , Paul Brady , Mick Moloney , Paul Kelly and Claudine Langille . John Sheahan and the late Barney McKenna , respectively fiddle player and tenor banjo player with The Dubliners , are also accomplished Irish mandolin players . The instruments used are either flat-backed , oval hole examples as described above ( made by UK luthier Roger Bucknall of Fylde Guitars ) , or carved-top , oval hole instruments with arched back ( made by Stefan Sobell in Northumberland ) . The Irish guitarist Rory Gallagher often played the mandolin on stage , and he most famously used it in the song " Going To My Hometown . "
Super Bowl 50 featured numerous records from individuals and teams . Denver won despite being massively outgained in total yards ( 315 to 194 ) and first downs ( 21 to 11 ) . Their 194 yards and 11 first downs were both the lowest totals ever by a Super Bowl winning team . The previous record was 244 yards by the Baltimore Ravens in Super Bowl XXXV . Only seven other teams had ever gained less than 200 yards in a Super Bowl , and all of them had lost . The Broncos ' seven sacks tied a Super Bowl record set by the Chicago Bears in Super Bowl XX . Kony Ealy tied a Super Bowl record with three sacks . Jordan Norwood 's 61-yard punt return set a new record , surpassing the old record of 45 yards set by John Taylor in Super Bowl XXIII . Denver was just 1-of-14 on third down , while Carolina was barely better at 3-of-15 . The two teams ' combined third down conversion percentage of 13.8 was a Super Bowl low . Manning and Newton had quarterback passer ratings of 56.6 and 55.4 , respectively , and their added total of 112 is a record lowest aggregate passer rating for a Super Bowl . Manning became the oldest quarterback ever to win a Super Bowl at age 39 , and the first quarterback ever to win a Super Bowl with two different teams , while Gary Kubiak became the first head coach to win a Super Bowl with the same franchise he went to the Super Bowl with as a player .
UNFPA is the world 's largest multilateral source of funding for population and reproductive health programs . The Fund works with governments and non-governmental organizations in over 150 countries with the support of the international community , supporting programs that help women , men and young people :
The Ptolemaic Kingdom was a powerful Hellenistic state , extending from southern Syria in the east , to Cyrene to the west , and south to the frontier with Nubia . Alexandria became the capital city and a centre of Greek culture and trade . To gain recognition by the native Egyptian populace , they named themselves as the successors to the Pharaohs . The later Ptolemies took on Egyptian traditions , had themselves portrayed on public monuments in Egyptian style and dress , and participated in Egyptian religious life .
Most of Egypt 's rain falls in the winter months . South of Cairo , rainfall averages only around 2 to 5 mm ( 0.1 to 0.2 in ) per year and at intervals of many years . On a very thin strip of the northern coast the rainfall can be as high as 410 mm ( 16.1 in ) , mostly between October and March . Snow falls on Sinai 's mountains and some of the north coastal cities such as Damietta , Baltim , Sidi Barrany , etc . and rarely in Alexandria . A very small amount of snow fell on Cairo on 13 December 2013 , the first time Cairo received snowfall in many decades . Frost is also known in mid-Sinai and mid-Egypt . Egypt is the driest and the sunniest country in the world , and most of its land surface is desert .
The early Christian philosophy of Augustine of Hippo was heavily influenced by Plato . A key change brought about by Christian thought was the moderatation of the Stoicism and theory of justice of the Roman world , as well emphasis on the role of the state in applying mercy as a moral example . Augustine also preached that one was not a member of his or her city , but was either a citizen of the City of God ( Civitas Dei ) or the City of Man ( Civitas Terrena ) . Augustine 's City of God is an influential work of this period that attacked the thesis , held by many Christian Romans , that the Christian view could be realized on Earth .
Peyton Manning became the first quarterback ever to lead two different teams to multiple Super Bowls . He is also the oldest quarterback ever to play in a Super Bowl at age 39 . The past record was held by John Elway , who led the Broncos to victory in Super Bowl XXXIII at age 38 and is currently Denver 's Executive Vice President of Football Operations and General Manager .
But Amnesty International found no evidence that UNFPA had supported the coercion . A 2001 study conducted by the pro-life Population Research Institute ( PRI ) falsely claimed that the UNFPA shared an office with the Chinese family planning officials who were carrying out forced abortions . " We located the family planning offices , and in that family planning office , we located the UNFPA office , and we confirmed from family planning officials there that there is no distinction between what the UNFPA does and what the Chinese Family Planning Office does , " said Scott Weinberg , a spokesman for PRI . However , United Nations Members disagreed and approved UNFPA ’ s new country program me in January 2006 . The more than 130 members of the “ Group of 77 ” developing countries in the United Nations expressed support for the UNFPA programmes . In addition , speaking for European democracies -- Norway , Denmark , Sweden , Finland , the Netherlands , France , Belgium , Switzerland and Germany -- the United Kingdom stated , ” UNFPA ’ s activities in China , as in the rest of the world , are in strict conformity with the unanimously adopted Programme of Action of the ICPD , and play a key role in supporting our common endeavor , the promotion and protection of all human rights and fundamental freedoms . ”
In July 2013 , Sony Music withdrew from the Greek market due to an economic crisis . Albums released by Sony Music in Greece from domestic and foreign artists are carried by Feelgood Records .
The city grew out towards the west of the boundaries of the peninsula formed by the River Aare . The Zytglogge tower marked the western boundary of the city from 1191 until 1256 , when the Käfigturm took over this role until 1345 . It was , in turn , succeeded by the Christoffelturm ( formerly located close to the site of the modern-day railway station ) until 1622 . During the time of the Thirty Years ' War , two new fortifications – the so-called big and small Schanze ( entrenchment ) – were built to protect the whole area of the peninsula .
Rep. Christopher H. Smith ( R-NJ ) , criticized the State Department investigation , saying the investigators were shown " Potemkin Villages " where residents had been intimidated into lying about the family-planning program . Dr. Nafis Sadik , former director of UNFPA said her agency had been pivotal in reversing China 's coercive population control methods , but a 2005 report by Amnesty International and a separate report by the United States State Department found that coercive techniques were still regularly employed by the Chinese , casting doubt upon Sadik 's statements .
The Panthers used the San Jose State practice facility and stayed at the San Jose Marriott . The Broncos practiced at Stanford University and stayed at the Santa Clara Marriott .
In early modern times , cardinals often had important roles in secular affairs . In some cases , they took on powerful positions in government . In Henry VIII 's England , his chief minister was Cardinal Wolsey . Cardinal Richelieu 's power was so great that he was for many years effectively the ruler of France . Richelieu successor was also a cardinal , Jules Mazarin . Guillaume Dubois and André-Hercule de Fleury complete the list of the " four great " cardinals to have ruled France . [ citation needed ] In Portugal , due to a succession crisis , one cardinal , Henry , King of Portugal , was crowned king , the only example of a cardinal-king .
The city 's population rose from about 5,000 in the 15th century to about 12,000 by 1800 and to above 60,000 by 1900 , passing the 100,000 mark during the 1920s . Population peaked during the 1960s at 165,000 , and has since decreased slightly , to below 130,000 by 2000 . As of October 2015 , the resident population stood at 140,634 , of which 100,634 were Swiss citizens and 40,000 ( 30 % ) resident foreigners . A further estimated 350,000 people live in the immediate urban agglomeration .
There are many important organozinc compounds . Organozinc chemistry is the science of organozinc compounds describing their physical properties , synthesis and reactions . Among important applications is the Frankland-Duppa Reaction in which an oxalate ester ( ROCOCOOR ) reacts with an alkyl halide R'X , zinc and hydrochloric acid to the α-hydroxycarboxylic esters RR'COHCOOR , the Reformatskii reaction which converts α-halo-esters and aldehydes to β-hydroxy-esters , the Simmons–Smith reaction in which the carbenoid ( iodomethyl ) zinc iodide reacts with alkene ( or alkyne ) and converts them to cyclopropane , the Addition reaction of organozinc compounds to carbonyl compounds . The Barbier reaction ( 1899 ) is the zinc equivalent of the magnesium Grignard reaction and is better of the two . In presence of just about any water the formation of the organomagnesium halide will fail , whereas the Barbier reaction can even take place in water . On the downside organozincs are much less nucleophilic than Grignards , are expensive and difficult to handle . Commercially available diorganozinc compounds are dimethylzinc , diethylzinc and diphenylzinc . In one study the active organozinc compound is obtained from much cheaper organobromine precursors :
Zinc is an essential mineral perceived by the public today as being of " exceptional biologic and public health importance " , especially regarding prenatal and postnatal development . Zinc deficiency affects about two billion people in the developing world and is associated with many diseases . In children it causes growth retardation , delayed sexual maturation , infection susceptibility , and diarrhea . Enzymes with a zinc atom in the reactive center are widespread in biochemistry , such as alcohol dehydrogenase in humans . Consumption of excess zinc can cause ataxia , lethargy and copper deficiency .
As the designated home team in the annual rotation between AFC and NFC teams , the Broncos elected to wear their road white jerseys with matching white pants . Elway stated , " We 've had Super Bowl success in our white uniforms . " The Broncos last wore matching white jerseys and pants in the Super Bowl in Super Bowl XXXIII , Elway 's last game as Denver QB , when they defeated the Atlanta Falcons 34–19 . In their only other Super Bowl win in Super Bowl XXXII , Denver wore blue jerseys , which was their primary color at the time . They also lost Super Bowl XXI when they wore white jerseys , but they are 0-4 in Super Bowls when wearing orange jerseys , losing in Super Bowl XII , XXII , XXIV , and XLVIII . The only other AFC champion team to have worn white as the designated home team in the Super Bowl was the Pittsburgh Steelers ; they defeated the Seattle Seahawks 21–10 in Super Bowl XL 10 seasons prior . The Broncos ' decision to wear white meant the Panthers would wear their standard home uniform : black jerseys with silver pants .
In addition to the Vince Lombardi Trophy that all Super Bowl champions receive , the winner of Super Bowl 50 will also receive a large , 18-karat gold-plated " 50 " . Each digit will weigh 33 lb ( 15 kg ) for a total of 66 lb ( 30 kg ) . Like the Lombardi Trophy , the " 50 " will be designed by Tiffany & Co .
Pope Leo X was used to reformers and heretics , and he responded slowly , " with great care as is proper . " Over the next three years he deployed a series of papal theologians and envoys against Luther , which served only to harden the reformer 's anti-papal theology . First , the Dominican theologian Sylvester Mazzolini drafted a heresy case against Luther , whom Leo then summoned to Rome . The Elector Frederick persuaded the pope to have Luther examined at Augsburg , where the Imperial Diet was held . There , in October 1518 , under questioning by papal legate Cardinal Cajetan Luther stated that he did not consider the papacy part of the biblical Church because historistical interpretation of Bible prophecy concluded that the papacy was the Antichrist . The prophecies concerning the Antichrist soon became the center of controversy . The hearings degenerated into a shouting match . More than his writing the 95 Theses , Luther 's confrontation with the church cast him as an enemy of the pope . Cajetan 's original instructions had been to arrest Luther if he failed to recant , but the legate desisted from doing so . Luther slipped out of the city at night , unbeknownst to Cajetan .
In 1523 , Luther wrote that Jesus Christ was born a Jew which discouraged mistreatment of the Jews and advocated their conversion by proving that the Old Testament could be shown to speak of Jesus Christ . However , as the Reformation continued , Luther began to lose hope in large-scale Jewish conversion to Christianity . In his later years , Luther grew more hostile toward the Jews , writing against them with the kind of venom he had already unleashed on the Anabaptists , Zwinglianism , and the papacy . His 1543 treatise Von den Juden und ihren Lügen ( On the Jews and Their Lies ) took its place among other anti-Jewish literature of the times , although historians acknowledge that this treatise was particularly extreme , even by the standards of sixteenth century Europe . In it , he takes a hardline against Judaism , writing that synagogues and Jewish homes should be destroyed , their money confiscated , and liberty curtailed . These statements and their influence on antisemitism have contributed to his controversial status .
The Rose Garden ( Rosengarten ) , from which a scenic panoramic view of the medieval town centre can be enjoyed , is a well-kept Rosarium on a hill , converted into a park from a former cemetery in 1913 .
From December 1539 , Luther became implicated in the bigamy of Philip I , Landgrave of Hesse , who wanted to marry one of his wife 's ladies-in-waiting . Philip solicited the approval of Luther , Melanchthon , and Bucer , citing as a precedent the polygamy of the patriarchs . The theologians were not prepared to make a general ruling , and they reluctantly advised the landgrave that if he was determined , he should marry secretly and keep quiet about the matter . As a result , on 4 March 1540 , Philip married a second wife , Margarethe von der Saale , with Melanchthon and Bucer among the witnesses . However , Philip was unable to keep the marriage secret , and he threatened to make Luther 's advice public . Luther told him to " tell a good , strong lie " and deny the marriage completely , which Philip did during the subsequent public controversy . In the view of Luther 's biographer Martin Brecht , " giving confessional advice for Philip of Hesse was one of the worst mistakes Luther made , and , next to the landgrave himself , who was directly responsible for it , history chiefly holds Luther accountable " . Brecht argues that Luther 's mistake was not that he gave private pastoral advice , but that he miscalculated the political implications . The affair caused lasting damage to Luther 's reputation .
His last sermon was delivered at Eisleben , his place of birth , on 15 February 1546 , three days before his death . It was " entirely devoted to the obdurate Jews , whom it was a matter of great urgency to expel from all German territory , " according to Léon Poliakov . James Mackinnon writes that it concluded with a " fiery summons to drive the Jews bag and baggage from their midst , unless they desisted from their calumny and their usury and became Christians . " Luther said , " we want to practice Christian love toward them and pray that they convert , " but also that they are " our public enemies ... and if they could kill us all , they would gladly do so . And so often they do . "
Johann Eck , speaking on behalf of the Empire as assistant of the Archbishop of Trier , presented Luther with copies of his writings laid out on a table and asked him if the books were his , and whether he stood by their contents . Luther confirmed he was their author , but requested time to think about the answer to the second question . He prayed , consulted friends , and gave his response the next day :
It includes the entire Old Town , which is also a UNESCO World Heritage Site , and many sites within and around it . Some of the most notable in the Old Town include the Cathedral which was started in 1421 and is the tallest cathedral in Switzerland , the Zytglogge and Käfigturm towers , which mark two successive expansions of the Old Town , and the Holy Ghost Church , which is one of the largest Swiss Reformed churches in Switzerland . Within the Old Town , there are eleven 16th century fountains , most attributed to Hans Gieng , that are on the list .
From 1510 to 1520 , Luther lectured on the Psalms , the books of Hebrews , Romans , and Galatians . As he studied these portions of the Bible , he came to view the use of terms such as penance and righteousness by the Catholic Church in new ways . He became convinced that the church was corrupt in its ways and had lost sight of what he saw as several of the central truths of Christianity . The most important for Luther was the doctrine of justification – God 's act of declaring a sinner righteous – by faith alone through God 's grace . He began to teach that salvation or redemption is a gift of God 's grace , attainable only through faith in Jesus as the Messiah . " This one and firm rock , which we call the doctrine of justification , " he wrote , " is the chief article of the whole Christian doctrine , which comprehends the understanding of all godliness . "
Blues rock acts that pioneered the sound included Cream , The Jimi Hendrix Experience , and The Jeff Beck Group . Cream , in songs like " I Feel Free " ( 1966 ) combined blues rock with pop and psychedelia , particularly in the riffs and guitar solos of Eric Clapton . Jimi Hendrix produced a form of blues-influenced psychedelic rock , which combined elements of jazz , blues and rock and roll . From 1967 Jeff Beck brought lead guitar to new heights of technical virtuosity and moved blues rock in the direction of heavy rock with his band , The Jeff Beck Group . Dave Davies of The Kinks , Keith Richards of The Rolling Stones , Pete Townshend of The Who , Hendrix , Clapton and Beck all pioneered the use of new guitar effects like phasing , feedback and distortion . The Beatles began producing songs in the new hard rock style beginning with the White Album in 1968 and , with the track " Helter Skelter " , attempted to create a greater level of noise than the Who . Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic has described the " proto-metal roar " of " Helter Skelter , " while Ian MacDonald argued that " their attempts at emulating the heavy style were without exception embarrassing . "
Beside the introduction of the lute to Spain ( Andalusia ) by the Moors , another important point of transfer of the lute from Arabian to European culture was Sicily , where it was brought either by Byzantine or later by Muslim musicians . There were singer-lutenists at the court in Palermo following the Norman conquest of the island from the Muslims , and the lute is depicted extensively in the ceiling paintings in the Palermo ’ s royal Cappella Palatina , dedicated by the Norman King Roger II of Sicily in 1140 . His Hohenstaufen grandson Frederick II , Holy Roman Emperor ( 1194 - 1250 ) continued integrating Muslims into his court , including Moorish musicians . By the 14th century , lutes had disseminated throughout Italy and , probably because of the cultural influence of the Hohenstaufen kings and emperor , based in Palermo , the lute had also made significant inroads into the German-speaking lands .
The Panthers defense gave up just 308 points , ranking sixth in the league , while also leading the NFL in interceptions with 24 and boasting four Pro Bowl selections . Pro Bowl defensive tackle Kawann Short led the team in sacks with 11 , while also forcing three fumbles and recovering two . Fellow lineman Mario Addison added 6½ sacks . The Panthers line also featured veteran defensive end Jared Allen , a 5-time pro bowler who was the NFL 's active career sack leader with 136 , along with defensive end Kony Ealy , who had 5 sacks in just 9 starts . Behind them , two of the Panthers three starting linebackers were also selected to play in the Pro Bowl : Thomas Davis and Luke Kuechly . Davis compiled 5½ sacks , four forced fumbles , and four interceptions , while Kuechly led the team in tackles ( 118 ) forced two fumbles , and intercepted four passes of his own . Carolina 's secondary featured Pro Bowl safety Kurt Coleman , who led the team with a career high seven interceptions , while also racking up 88 tackles and Pro Bowl cornerback Josh Norman , who developed into a shutdown corner during the season and had four interceptions , two of which were returned for touchdowns .

The production for sulfidic zinc ores produces large amounts of sulfur dioxide and cadmium vapor . Smelter slag and other residues of process also contain significant amounts of heavy metals . About 1.1 million tonnes of metallic zinc and 130 thousand tonnes of lead were mined and smelted in the Belgian towns of La Calamine and Plombières between 1806 and 1882 . The dumps of the past mining operations leach significant amounts of zinc and cadmium , and , as a result , the sediments of the Geul River contain significant amounts of heavy metals . About two thousand years ago emissions of zinc from mining and smelting totaled 10 thousand tonnes a year . After increasing 10-fold from 1850 , zinc emissions peaked at 3.4 million tonnes per year in the 1980s and declined to 2.7 million tonnes in the 1990s , although a 2005 study of the Arctic troposphere found that the concentrations there did not reflect the decline . Anthropogenic and natural emissions occur at a ratio of 20 to 1 .
Published at a time of rising demand for German-language publications , Luther 's version quickly became a popular and influential Bible translation . As such , it made a significant contribution to the evolution of the German language and literature . Furnished with notes and prefaces by Luther , and with woodcuts by Lucas Cranach that contained anti-papal imagery , it played a major role in the spread of Luther 's doctrine throughout Germany . The Luther Bible influenced other vernacular translations , such as William Tyndale 's English Bible ( 1525 forward ) , a precursor of the King James Bible .
Luther wrote " Ach Gott , vom Himmel sieh darein " ( " Oh God , look down from heaven " ) . " Nun komm , der Heiden Heiland " ( Now come , Savior of the gentiles ) , based on Veni redemptor gentium , became the main hymn ( Hauptlied ) for Advent . He transformed A solus ortus cardine to " Christum wir sollen loben schon " ( " We should now praise Christ " ) and Veni Creator Spiritus to " Komm , Gott Schöpfer , Heiliger Geist " ( " Come , Holy Spirit , Lord God " ) . He wrote two hymns on the Ten Commandments , " Dies sind die heilgen Zehn Gebot " and " Mensch , willst du leben seliglich " . His " Gelobet seist du , Jesu Christ " ( " Praise be to You , Jesus Christ " ) became the main hymn for Christmas . He wrote for Pentecost " Nun bitten wir den Heiligen Geist " , and adopted for Easter " Christ ist erstanden " ( Christ is risen ) , based on Victimae paschali laudes . " Mit Fried und Freud ich fahr dahin " , a paraphrase of Nunc dimittis , was intended for Purification , but became also a funeral hymn . He paraphrased the Te Deum as " Herr Gott , dich loben wir " with a simplified form of the melody . It became known as the German Te Deum .
Sandra Laing is a South African woman who was classified as Coloured by authorities during the apartheid era , due to her skin colour and hair texture , although her parents could prove at least three generations of European ancestors . At age 10 , she was expelled from her all-white school . The officials ' decisions based on her anomalous appearance disrupted her family and adult life . She was the subject of the 2008 biographical dramatic film Skin , which won numerous awards .
In 1983 the historic old town in the centre of Bern became a UNESCO World Heritage Site . Bern is ranked among the world ’ s top ten cities for the best quality of life ( 2010 ) .
The defined dogma of the Immaculate Conception regards original sin only , saying that Mary was preserved from any stain ( in Latin , macula or labes , the second of these two synonymous words being the one used in the formal definition ) . The proclaimed Roman Catholic dogma states " that the most Blessed Virgin Mary , in the first instance of her conception , by a singular grace and privilege granted by Almighty God , in view of the merits of Jesus Christ , the Saviour of the human race , was preserved free from all stain of original sin . " Therefore , being always free from original sin , the doctrine teaches that from her conception Mary received the sanctifying grace that would normally come with baptism after birth .
Book 7 ( beginning the Iliadic half ) opens with an address to the muse and recounts Aeneas ' arrival in Italy and betrothal to Lavinia , daughter of King Latinus . Lavinia had already been promised to Turnus , the king of the Rutulians , who is roused to war by the Fury Allecto , and Amata Lavinia 's mother . In Book 8 , Aeneas allies with King Evander , who occupies the future site of Rome , and is given new armor and a shield depicting Roman history . Book 9 records an assault by Nisus and Euryalus on the Rutulians , Book 10 , the death of Evander 's young son Pallas , and 11 the death of the Volscian warrior princess Camilla and the decision to settle the war with a duel between Aeneas and Turnus . The Aeneid ends in Book 12 with the taking of Latinus ' city , the death of Amata , and Aeneas ' defeat and killing of Turnus , whose pleas for mercy are spurned . The final book ends with the image of Turnus ' soul lamenting as it flees to the underworld .
Various gold-themed promotions and initiatives were held throughout the 2015 NFL season to tie into the " Golden Super Bowl " ; gold-tinted logos were implemented across the NFL 's properties and painted on fields , the numbering of the 50-yard line on fields was colored gold , and beginning on week 7 , all sideline jackets and hats featured gold-trimmed logos . Gold footballs were given to each high school that has had a player or coach appear in the Super Bowl , and " homecoming " events were also held by Super Bowl-winning teams at games .
Islamic political philosophy , was , indeed , rooted in the very sources of Islam—i.e. , the Qur'an and the Sunnah , the words and practices of Muhammad—thus making it essentially theocratic . However , in the Western thought , it is generally supposed that it was a specific area peculiar merely to the great philosophers of Islam : al-Kindi ( Alkindus ) , al-Farabi ( Abunaser ) , İbn Sina ( Avicenna ) , Ibn Bajjah ( Avempace ) , Ibn Rushd ( Averroes ) , and Ibn Khaldun . The political conceptions of Islam such as kudrah ( power ) , sultan , ummah , cemaa ( obligation ) -and even the " core " terms of the Qur'an—i.e. , ibadah ( worship ) , din ( religion ) , rab ( master ) and ilah ( deity ) —is taken as the basis of an analysis . Hence , not only the ideas of the Muslim political philosophers but also many other jurists and ulama posed political ideas and theories . For example , the ideas of the Khawarij in the very early years of Islamic history on Khilafa and Ummah , or that of Shia Islam on the concept of Imamah are considered proofs of political thought . The clashes between the Ehl-i Sunna and Shia in the 7th and 8th centuries had a genuine political character .
In 1970 , President Nasser died and was succeeded by Anwar Sadat . Sadat switched Egypt 's Cold War allegiance from the Soviet Union to the United States , expelling Soviet advisors in 1972 . He launched the Infitah economic reform policy , while clamping down on religious and secular opposition . In 1973 , Egypt , along with Syria , launched the October War , a surprise attack to regain part of the Sinai territory Israel had captured 6 years earlier . it presented Sadat with a victory that allowed him to regain the Sinai later in return for peace with Israel .
In 1516 , Johann Tetzel , a Dominican friar and papal commissioner for indulgences , was sent to Germany by the Roman Catholic Church to sell indulgences to raise money to rebuild St. Peter 's Basilica in Rome . Roman Catholic theology stated that faith alone , whether fiduciary or dogmatic , can not justify man ; justification rather depends only on such faith as is active in charity and good works ( fides caritate formata ) . The benefits of good works could be obtained by donating money to the church .
From 2002 through 2008 , the Bush Administration denied funding to UNFPA that had already been allocated by the US Congress , partly on the refuted claims that the UNFPA supported Chinese government programs which include forced abortions and coercive sterilizations . In a letter from the Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Nicholas Burns to Congress , the administration said it had determined that UNFPA ’ s support for China ’ s population program “ facilitates ( its ) government ’ s coercive abortion program ” , thus violating the Kemp-Kasten Amendment , which bans the use of United States aid to finance organizations that support or take part in managing a program of coercive abortion of sterilization .
Boundaries can be inclusive or exclusive depending on how they are perceived by other people . An exclusive boundary arises , for example , when a person adopts a marker that imposes restrictions on the behaviour of others . An inclusive boundary is created , by contrast , by the use of a marker with which other people are ready and able to associate . At the same time , however , an inclusive boundary will also impose restrictions on the people it has included by limiting their inclusion within other boundaries . An example of this is the use of a particular language by a newcomer in a room full of people speaking various languages . Some people may understand the language used by this person while others may not . Those who do not understand it might take the newcomer 's use of this particular language merely as a neutral sign of identity . But they might also perceive it as imposing an exclusive boundary that is meant to mark them off from her . On the other hand , those who do understand the newcomer 's language could take it as an inclusive boundary , through which the newcomer associates herself with them to the exclusion of the other people present . Equally , however , it is possible that people who do understand the newcomer but who also speak another language may not want to speak the newcomer 's language and so see her marker as an imposition and a negative boundary . It is possible that the newcomer is either aware or unaware of this , depending on whether she herself knows other languages or is conscious of the plurilingual quality of the people there and is respectful of it or not .
These theorists were driven by two basic questions : one , by what right or need do people form states ; and two , what the best form for a state could be . These fundamental questions involved a conceptual distinction between the concepts of " state " and " government . " It was decided that " state " would refer to a set of enduring institutions through which power would be distributed and its use justified . The term " government " would refer to a specific group of people who occupied the institutions of the state , and create the laws and ordinances by which the people , themselves included , would be bound . This conceptual distinction continues to operate in political science , although some political scientists , philosophers , historians and cultural anthropologists have argued that most political action in any given society occurs outside of its state , and that there are societies that are not organized into states that nevertheless must be considered in political terms . As long as the concept of natural order was not introduced , the social sciences could not evolve independently of theistic thinking . Since the cultural revolution of the 17th century in England , which spread to France and the rest of Europe , society has been considered subject to natural laws akin to the physical world .
From the years 1500 to 1850 , an estimated 3.5 million captives were forcibly shipped from West/Central Africa to Brazil ; the territory received the highest number of slaves of any country in the Americas . Scholars estimate that more than half of the Brazilian population is at least in part descended from these individuals . Brazil has the largest population of Afro-descendants outside of Africa . In contrast to the US , during the slavery period and after , the Portuguese colonial government and later Brazilian government did not pass formal anti-miscegenation or segregation laws . As in other Latin countries , intermarriage was prevalent during the colonial period and continued afterward . In addition , people of mixed race ( pardo ) often tended to marry white , and their descendants became accepted as white . As a result , some of the European descended population also has West African or Amerindian blood . According to the last census of the 20th century , in which Brazilians could choose from five color/ethnic categories with which they identified , 54 % of individuals identified as white , 6.2 % identified as black , and 39.5 % identified as pardo ( brown ) — a broad multi-racial category , including tri-racial persons .
From the 2000 census [ update ] , 60,455 or 47.0 % belonged to the Swiss Reformed Church , while 31,510 or 24.5 % were Roman Catholic . Of the rest of the population , there were 1,874 members of an Orthodox church ( or about 1.46 % of the population ) , there were 229 persons ( or about 0.18 % of the population ) who belonged to the Christian Catholic Church , and there were 5,531 persons ( or about 4.30 % of the population ) who belonged to another Christian church . There were 324 persons ( or about 0.25 % of the population ) who were Jewish , and 4,907 ( or about 3.81 % of the population ) who were Muslim . There were 629 persons who were Buddhist , 1,430 persons who were Hindu and 177 persons who belonged to another church . 16,363 ( or about 12.72 % of the population ) belonged to no church , are agnostic or atheist , and 7,855 persons ( or about 6.11 % of the population ) did not answer the question . On 14 December 2014 the Haus der Religionen was inaugurated .
After each team punted , Panthers quarterback Cam Newton appeared to complete a 24-yard pass Jerricho Cotchery , but the call was ruled an incompletion and upheld after a replay challenge . CBS analyst and retired referee Mike Carey stated he disagreed with the call and felt the review clearly showed the pass was complete . A few plays later , on 3rd-and-10 from the 15-yard line , linebacker Von Miller knocked the ball out of Newton 's hands while sacking him , and Malik Jackson recovered it in the end zone for a Broncos touchdown , giving the team a 10–0 lead . This was the first fumble return touchdown in a Super Bowl since Super Bowl XXVIII at the end of the 1993 season .
The official language of Bern is ( the Swiss variety of Standard ) German , but the main spoken language is the Alemannic Swiss German dialect called Bernese German .
Rep. Christopher H. Smith ( R-NJ ) , criticized the State Department investigation , saying the investigators were shown " Potemkin Villages " where residents had been intimidated into lying about the family-planning program . Dr. Nafis Sadik , former director of UNFPA said her agency had been pivotal in reversing China 's coercive population control methods , but a 2005 report by Amnesty International and a separate report by the United States State Department found that coercive techniques were still regularly employed by the Chinese , casting doubt upon Sadik 's statements .
Binary compounds of zinc are known for most of the metalloids and all the nonmetals except the noble gases . The oxide ZnO is a white powder that is nearly insoluble in neutral aqueous solutions , but is amphoteric , dissolving in both strong basic and acidic solutions . The other chalcogenides ( ZnS , ZnSe , and ZnTe ) have varied applications in electronics and optics . Pnictogenides ( Zn 3N 2 , Zn 3P 2 , Zn 3As 2 and Zn 3Sb 2 ) , the peroxide ( ZnO 2 ) , the hydride ( ZnH 2 ) , and the carbide ( ZnC 2 ) are also known . Of the four halides , ZnF 2 has the most ionic character , whereas the others ( ZnCl 2 , ZnBr 2 , and ZnI 2 ) have relatively low melting points and are considered to have more covalent character .
Despite the disagreements on the Eucharist , the Marburg Colloquy paved the way for the signing in 1530 of the Augsburg Confession , and for the formation of the Schmalkaldic League the following year by leading Protestant nobles such as John of Saxony , Philip of Hesse , and George , Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach . The Swiss cities , however , did not sign these agreements .
The Dean of the College of Cardinals , or Cardinal-dean , is the primus inter pares of the College of Cardinals , elected by the cardinal bishops holding suburbicarian sees from among their own number , an election , however , that must be approved by the Pope . Formerly the position of dean belonged by right to the longest-serving of the cardinal bishops .
In accordance with tradition , they sign by placing the title " Cardinal " ( abbreviated Card . ) after their personal name and before their surname as , for instance , " John Card ( inal ) Doe " or , in Latin , " Ioannes Card ( inalis ) Cognomen " . Some writers , such as James-Charles Noonan , hold that , in the case of cardinals , the form used for signatures should be used also when referring to them in English . Official sources such as the Archdiocese of Milwaukee and Catholic News Service say that the correct form for referring to a cardinal in English is normally as " Cardinal [ First name ] [ Surname ] " . This is the rule given also in stylebooks not associated with the Catholic Church . This style is also generally followed on the websites of the Holy See and episcopal conferences . Oriental Patriarchs who are created Cardinals customarily use " Sanctae Ecclesiae Cardinalis " as their full title , probably because they do not belong to the Roman clergy .
Mandolin has also been used in blues music , most notably by Ry Cooder , who performed outstanding covers on his very first recordings , Yank Rachell , Johnny " Man " Young , Carl Martin , and Gerry Hundt . Howard Armstrong , who is famous for blues violin , got his start with his father 's mandolin and played in string bands similar to the other Tennessee string bands he came into contact with , with band makeup including " mandolins and fiddles and guitars and banjos . And once in a while they would ease a little ukulele in there and a bass fiddle . " Other blues players from the era 's string bands include Willie Black ( Whistler And His Jug Band ) , Dink Brister , Jim Hill , Charles Johnson , Coley Jones ( Dallas String Band ) , Bobby Leecan ( Need More Band ) , Alfred Martin , Charlie McCoy ( 1909-1950 ) , Al Miller , Matthew Prater , and Herb Quinn .
Luther 's hymns were frequently evoked by particular events in his life and the unfolding Reformation . This behavior started with his learning of the execution of Johann Esch and Heinrich Voes , the first individuals to be martyred by the Roman Catholic Church for Lutheran views , prompting Luther to write the hymn " Ein neues Lied wir heben an " ( " A new song we raise " ) , which is generally known in English by John C. Messenger 's translation by the title and first line " Flung to the Heedless Winds " and sung to the tune Ibstone composed in 1875 by Maria C. Tiddeman .
Historians estimate that between the advent of Islam in 650CE and the abolition of slavery in the Arabian Peninsula in the mid-20th century , 10 to 18 million sub-Saharan Black Africans were enslaved by Arab slave traders and transported to the Arabian Peninsula and neighboring countries . This number far exceeded the number of slaves who were taken to the Americas . Several factors affected the visibility of descendants of this diaspora in 21st-century Arab societies : The traders shipped more female slaves than males , as there was a demand for them to serve as concubines in harems in the Arabian Peninsula and neighboring countries . Male slaves were castrated in order to serve as harem guards . The death toll of Black African slaves from forced labor was high . The mixed-race children of female slaves and Arab owners were assimilated into the Arab owners ' families under the patrilineal kinship system . As a result , few distinctive Afro-Arab black communities have survived in the Arabian Peninsula and neighboring countries .
UNFPA began operations in 1969 as the United Nations Fund for Population Activities ( the name was changed in 1987 ) under the administration of the United Nations Development Fund . In 1971 it was placed under the authority of the United Nations General Assembly .
These styles generally have either two f-shaped soundholes like a violin ( F-5 and A-5 ) , or an oval sound hole ( F-4 and A-4 and lower models ) directly under the strings . Much variation exists between makers working from these archetypes , and other variants have become increasingly common . Generally , in the United States , Gibson F-hole F-5 mandolins and mandolins influenced by that design are strongly associated with bluegrass , while the A-style is associated other types of music , although it too is most often used for and associated with bluegrass . The F-5 's more complicated woodwork also translates into a more expensive instrument .
Luther had been suffering from ill health for years , including Ménière 's disease , vertigo , fainting , tinnitus , and a cataract in one eye . From 1531 to 1546 , his health deteriorated further . The years of struggle with Rome , the antagonisms with and among his fellow reformers , and the scandal which ensued from the bigamy of the Philip of Hesse incident , in which Luther had played a leading role , all may have contributed . In 1536 , he began to suffer from kidney and bladder stones , and arthritis , and an ear infection ruptured an ear drum . In December 1544 , he began to feel the effects of angina .
After the First World War , however , it became apparent that the number of mixed-race people was growing at a faster rate than the white population , and by 1930 fear of the " half-caste menace " undermining the White Australia ideal from within was being taken as a serious concern . Dr. Cecil Cook , the Northern Territory Protector of Natives , noted that :
Concerns were raised over whether Levi 's Stadium 's field was of a high enough quality to host a Super Bowl ; during the inaugural season , the field had to be re-sodded multiple times due to various issues , and during a week 6 game earlier in the 2015 season , a portion of the turf collapsed under Baltimore Ravens kicker Justin Tucker , causing him to slip and miss a field goal , although the field has not had any major issues since . As is customary for Super Bowl games played at natural grass stadiums , the NFL re-sodded the field with a new playing surface ; a hybrid Bermuda 419 turf . NFL and Atlanta Braves field director Ed Mangan stated that the field was in " great shape " for gameday . However , the turf showed problem throughout the game , with a number of players needing to change their cleats during the game and player slipping during plays all throughout the game .
Because of the acceptance of miscegenation , Brazil has avoided the binary polarization of society into black and white . In addition , it abolished slavery without a civil war . The bitter and sometimes violent racial tensions that have divided the US are notably absent in Brazil . According to the 2010 census , 6.7 % of Brazilians said they were black , compared with 6.2 % in 2000 , and 43.1 % said they were racially mixed , up from 38.5 % . In 2010 , Elio Ferreira de Araujo , Brazil 's minister for racial equality , attributed the increases to growing pride among his country 's black and indigenous communities .
In 1983 the historic old town in the centre of Bern became a UNESCO World Heritage Site . Bern is ranked among the world ’ s top ten cities for the best quality of life ( 2010 ) .
The UNFPA supports programs in more than 150 countries , territories and areas spread across four geographic regions : Arab States and Europe , Asia and the Pacific , Latin America and the Caribbean , and sub-Saharan Africa . Around three quarters of the staff work in the field . It is a member of the United Nations Development Group and part of its Executive Committee .
The service started on 1 September 1993 based on the idea from the then chief executive officer , Sam Chisholm and Rupert Murdoch , of converting the company business strategy to an entirely fee-based concept . The new package included four channels formerly available free-to-air , broadcasting on Astra 's satellites , as well as introducing new channels . The service continued until the closure of BSkyB 's analogue service on 27 September 2001 , due to the launch and expansion of the Sky Digital platform . Some of the channels did broadcast either in the clear or soft encrypted ( whereby a Videocrypt decoder was required to decode , without a subscription card ) prior to their addition to the Sky Multichannels package . Within two months of the launch , BSkyB gained 400,000 new subscribers , with the majority taking at least one premium channel as well , which helped BSkyB reach 3.5 million households by mid-1994 . Michael Grade criticized the operations in front of the Select Committee on National Heritage , mainly for the lack of original programming on many of the new channels .
Egypt also hosts an unknown number of refugees and asylum seekers , estimated to be between 500,000 and 3 million . There are some 70,000 Palestinian refugees , and about 150,000 recently arrived Iraqi refugees , but the number of the largest group , the Sudanese , is contested . [ nb 1 ] The once-vibrant and ancient Greek and Jewish communities in Egypt have almost disappeared , with only a small number remaining in the country , but many Egyptian Jews visit on religious or other occasions and tourism . Several important Jewish archaeological and historical sites are found in Cairo , Alexandria and other cities .
Foreign direct investment ( FDI ) in Egypt increased considerably before the removal of Hosni Mubarak , exceeding $ 6 billion in 2006 , due to economic liberalisation and privatisation measures taken by minister of investment Mahmoud Mohieddin . [ citation needed ] Since the fall of Hosni Mubarak in 2011 , Egypt has experienced a drastic fall in both foreign investment and tourism revenues , followed by a 60 % drop in foreign exchange reserves , a 3 % drop in growth , and a rapid devaluation of the Egyptian pound .
Hard rock is a form of loud , aggressive rock music . The electric guitar is often emphasised , used with distortion and other effects , both as a rhythm instrument using repetitive riffs with a varying degree of complexity , and as a solo lead instrument . Drumming characteristically focuses on driving rhythms , strong bass drum and a backbeat on snare , sometimes using cymbals for emphasis . The bass guitar works in conjunction with the drums , occasionally playing riffs , but usually providing a backing for the rhythm and lead guitars . Vocals are often growling , raspy , or involve screaming or wailing , sometimes in a high range , or even falsetto voice .
The Broncos defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers in the divisional round , 23–16 , by scoring 11 points in the final three minutes of the game . They then beat the defending Super Bowl XLIX champion New England Patriots in the AFC Championship Game , 20–18 , by intercepting a pass on New England 's 2-point conversion attempt with 17 seconds left on the clock . Despite Manning 's problems with interceptions during the season , he did n't throw any in their two playoff games .
Luther wrote about the Jews throughout his career , though only a few of his works dealt with them directly . Luther rarely encountered Jews during his life , but his attitudes reflected a theological and cultural tradition which saw Jews as a rejected people guilty of the murder of Christ , and he lived within a local community that had expelled Jews some ninety years earlier . He considered the Jews blasphemers and liars because they rejected the divinity of Jesus , whereas Christians believed Jesus was the Messiah . But Luther believed that all human beings who set themselves against God were equally guilty . As early as 1516 , he wrote that many people " are proud with marvelous stupidity when they call the Jews dogs , evildoers , or whatever they like , while they too , and equally , do not realize who or what they are in the sight of God " . In 1523 , Luther advised kindness toward the Jews in That Jesus Christ was Born a Jew and also aimed to convert them to Christianity . When his efforts at conversion failed , he grew increasingly bitter toward them . In his 2010 book Bonhoeffer : Pastor , Martyr , Prophet , Spy , Christian author Eric Metaxas claimed that Luther 's attitude towards Jews " unraveled along with his health . "
The enforcement of the ban on the 95 Theses fell to the secular authorities . On 18 April 1521 , Luther appeared as ordered before the Diet of Worms . This was a general assembly of the estates of the Holy Roman Empire that took place in Worms , a town on the Rhine . It was conducted from 28 January to 25 May 1521 , with Emperor Charles V presiding . Prince Frederick III , Elector of Saxony , obtained a safe conduct for Luther to and from the meeting .
The game 's media day , which was typically held on the Tuesday afternoon prior to the game , was moved to the Monday evening and re-branded as Super Bowl Opening Night . The event was held on February 1 , 2016 at SAP Center in San Jose . Alongside the traditional media availabilities , the event featured an opening ceremony with player introductions on a replica of the Golden Gate Bridge .

Different societies apply differing criteria regarding who is classified as " black " , and these social constructs have also changed over time . In a number of countries , societal variables affect classification as much as skin color , and the social criteria for " blackness " vary . For example , in North America the term black people is not necessarily an indicator of skin color or majority ethnic ancestry , but it is instead a socially based racial classification related to being African American , with a family history associated with institutionalized slavery . In South Africa and Latin America , for instance , mixed-race people are generally not classified as " black . " In South Pacific regions such as Australia and Melanesia , European colonists applied the term " black " or it was used by populations with different histories and ethnic origin .

By that time , the majority of black people in the United States were native-born , so the use of the term " African " became problematic . Though initially a source of pride , many blacks feared that the use of African as an identity would be a hindrance to their fight for full citizenship in the US . They also felt that it would give ammunition to those who were advocating repatriating black people back to Africa . In 1835 , black leaders called upon Black Americans to remove the title of " African " from their institutions and replace it with " Negro " or " Colored American " . A few institutions chose to keep their historic names , such as the African Methodist Episcopal Church . African Americans popularly used the terms " Negro " or " colored " for themselves until the late 1960s .
Brass , which is an alloy of copper and zinc , has been used since at least the 10th century BC in Judea and by the 7th century BC in Ancient Greece . Zinc metal was not produced on a large scale until the 12th century in India and was unknown to Europe until the end of the 16th century . The mines of Rajasthan have given definite evidence of zinc production going back to the 6th century BC . To date , the oldest evidence of pure zinc comes from Zawar , in Rajasthan , as early as the 9th century AD when a distillation process was employed to make pure zinc . Alchemists burned zinc in air to form what they called " philosopher 's wool " or " white snow " .
The chemistry of zinc is dominated by the +2 oxidation state . When compounds in this oxidation state are formed the outer shell s electrons are lost , which yields a bare zinc ion with the electronic configuration [ Ar ] 3d10 . In aqueous solution an octahedral complex , [ Zn ( H 2O ) 6 ] 2+ is the predominant species . The volatilization of zinc in combination with zinc chloride at temperatures above 285 °C indicates the formation of Zn 2Cl 2 , a zinc compound with a +1 oxidation state . No compounds of zinc in oxidation states other than +1 or +2 are known . Calculations indicate that a zinc compound with the oxidation state of +4 is unlikely to exist .
By the 2000 census , demographic changes including the end to slavery , immigration from Europe and Asia , assimilation of multiracial persons , and other factors resulted in a population in which 6.2 % of the population identified as black , 40 % as pardo , and 55 % as white . Essentially most of the black population was absorbed into the multi-racial category by intermixing . A 2007 genetic study found that at least 29 % of the middle-class , white Brazilian population had some recent ( since 1822 and the end of the colonial period ) African ancestry .
World War I was a watershed event in human history , changing views of governments and politics . The Russian Revolution of 1917 ( and similar , albeit less successful , revolutions in many other European countries ) brought communism - and in particular the political theory of Leninism , but also on a smaller level Luxemburgism ( gradually ) - on the world stage . At the same time , social democratic parties won elections and formed governments for the first time , often as a result of the introduction of universal suffrage . However , a group of central European economists led by Austrian School economists Ludwig von Mises and Friedrich Hayek identified the collectivist underpinnings to the various new socialist and fascist doctrines of government power as being different brands of political totalitarianism .

The flagship stations of each station in the markets of each team will carry their local play-by-play calls . In Denver , KOA ( 850 AM ) and KRFX ( 103.5 FM ) will carry the game , with Dave Logan on play-by-play and Ed McCaffrey on color commentary . In North Carolina , WBT ( 1110 AM ) will carry the game , with Mick Mixon on play-by-play and Eugene Robinson and Jim Szoke on color commentary . WBT will also simulcast the game on its sister station WBT-FM ( 99.3 FM ) , which is based in Chester , South Carolina . As KOA and WBT are both clear-channel stations , the local broadcasts will be audible over much of the western United States after sunset ( for Denver ) and the eastern United States throughout the game ( for Carolina ) . In accordance with contractual rules , the rest of the stations in the Broncos and Panthers radio networks will either carry the Westwood One feed or not carry the game at all .
In 1630 , Pope Urban VIII decreed their title to be Eminence ( previously , it had been " illustrissimo " and " reverendissimo " ) and decreed that their secular rank would equate to Prince , making them secondary only to the Pope and crowned monarchs .
Weinreich 's identity variant similarly includes the categories of identity diffusion , foreclosure and crisis , but with a somewhat different emphasis . Here , with respect to identity diffusion for example , an optimal level is interpreted as the norm , as it is unrealistic to expect an individual to resolve all their conflicted identifications with others ; therefore we should be alert to individuals with levels which are much higher or lower than the norm – highly diffused individuals are classified as diffused , and those with low levels as foreclosed or defensive . ( Weinreich & Saunderson , 2003 , pp 65–67 ; 105-106 ) . Weinreich applies the identity variant in a framework which also allows for the transition from one to another by way of biographical experiences and resolution of conflicted identifications situated in various contexts – for example , an adolescent going through family break-up may be in one state , whereas later in a stable marriage with a secure professional role may be in another . Hence , though there is continuity , there is also development and change . ( Weinreich & Saunderson , 2003 , pp 22–23 ) .
Approximately 12 million Africans were shipped to the Americas during the Atlantic slave trade from 1492 to 1888 , with 11.5 million of those shipped to South America and the Caribbean . Brazil was the largest importer in the Americas , with 5.5 million African slaves imported , followed by the British Caribbean with 2.76 million , the Spanish Caribbean and Spanish Mainland with 1.59 million Africans , and the French Caribbean with 1.32 million . Today their descendants number approximately 150 million in South America and the Caribbean . In addition to skin color , other physical characteristics such as facial features and hair texture are often variously used in classifying peoples as black in South America and the Caribbean . In South America and the Caribbean , classification as black is also closely tied to social status and socioeconomic variables , especially in light of social conceptions of " blanqueamiento " ( racial whitening ) and related concepts .
Western political philosophy originates in the philosophy of ancient Greece , where political philosophy dates back to at least Plato . Ancient Greece was dominated by city-states , which experimented with various forms of political organization , grouped by Plato into four categories : timocracy , tyranny , democracy and oligarchy . One of the first , extremely important classical works of political philosophy is Plato 's Republic , which was followed by Aristotle 's Nichomachean Ethics and Politics . Roman political philosophy was influenced by the Stoics , including the Roman statesman Cicero .
On 17 December 1941 , seven Protestant regional church confederations issued a statement agreeing with the policy of forcing Jews to wear the yellow badge , " since after his bitter experience Luther had already suggested preventive measures against the Jews and their expulsion from German territory . " According to Daniel Goldhagen , Bishop Martin Sasse , a leading Protestant churchman , published a compendium of Luther 's writings shortly after Kristallnacht , for which Diarmaid MacCulloch , Professor of the History of the Church in the University of Oxford argued that Luther 's writing was a " blueprint . " Sasse applauded the burning of the synagogues and the coincidence of the day , writing in the introduction , " On 10 November 1938 , on Luther 's birthday , the synagogues are burning in Germany . " The German people , he urged , ought to heed these words " of the greatest antisemite of his time , the warner of his people against the Jews . "
Denver took the opening kickoff and started out strong with Peyton Manning completing an 18-yard pass to tight end Owen Daniels and a 22-yard throw to receiver Andre Caldwell . A pair of carries by C. J. Anderson moved the ball up 20 yards to the Panthers 14-yard line , but Carolina 's defense dug in over the next three plays . First , linebacker Shaq Thompson tackled Ronnie Hillman for a 3-yard loss . Then after an incompletion , Thomas Davis tackled Anderson for a 1-yard gain on third down , forcing Denver to settle for a 3–0 lead on a Brandon McManus 34-yard field goal . The score marked the first time in the entire postseason that Carolina was facing a deficit .
A person may display either relative weakness or relative strength in terms of both exploration and commitments . When assigned categories , four possible permutations result : identity diffusion , identity foreclosure , identity moratorium , and identity achievement . Diffusion is when a person lacks both exploration in life and interest in committing even to those unchosen roles that he or she occupies . Foreclosure is when a person has not chosen extensively in the past , but seems willing to commit to some relevant values , goals , or roles in the future . Moratorium is when a person displays a kind of flightiness , ready to make choices but unable to commit to them . Finally , achievement is when a person makes identity choices and commits to them .
Prior to the Golden Age of Mandolins , France had a history with the mandolin , with mandolinists playing in Paris until the Napoleonic Wars . The players , teachers and composers included Giovanni Fouchetti , Eduardo Mezzacapo , Gabriele Leon , and Gervasio . During the Golden age itself ( 1880s-1920s ) , the mandolin had a strong presence in France . Prominent mandolin players or composers included Jules Cottin and his sister Madeleine Cottin , Jean Pietrapertosa , and Edgar Bara . Paris had dozens of " estudiantina " mandolin orchestras in the early 1900s . Mandolin magazines included L'Estudiantina , Le Plectre , École de la mandolie .
Sony renamed the record company Sony Music Entertainment ( SME ) on January 1 , 1991 , fulfilling the terms set under the 1988 buyout , which granted only a transitional license to the CBS trademark . The CBS Associated label was renamed Epic Associated . Also on January 1 , 1991 , to replace the CBS label , Sony reintroduced the Columbia label worldwide , which it previously held in the United States and Canada only , after it acquired the international rights to the trademark from EMI in 1990 . Japan is the only country where Sony does not have rights to the Columbia name as it is controlled by Nippon Columbia , an unrelated company . Thus , until this day , Sony Music Entertainment Japan does not use the Columbia trademark for Columbia label recordings from outside Japan which are issued in Japan . The Columbia Records trademark 's rightsholder in Spain was Bertelsmann Music Group , Germany , which Sony Music subsequently subsumed via a 2004 merger , followed by a 2008 buyout .

Several dozen radioisotopes have been characterized . 65Zn , which has a half-life of 243.66 days , is the most long-lived radioisotope , followed by 72Zn with a half-life of 46.5 hours . Zinc has 10 nuclear isomers . 69mZn has the longest half-life , 13.76 h. The superscript m indicates a metastable isotope . The nucleus of a metastable isotope is in an excited state and will return to the ground state by emitting a photon in the form of a gamma ray . 61Zn has three excited states and 73Zn has two . The isotopes 65Zn , 71Zn , 77Zn and 78Zn each have only one excited state .
The papal bull defining the dogma , Ineffabilis Deus , mentioned in particular the patrististic interpretation of Genesis 3:15 as referring to a woman , Mary , who would be eternally at enmity with the evil serpent and completely triumphing over him . It said the Fathers saw foreshadowings of Mary 's " wondrous abundance of divine gifts and original innocence " " in that ark of Noah , which was built by divine command and escaped entirely safe and sound from the common shipwreck of the whole world ; in the ladder which Jacob saw reaching from the earth to heaven , by whose rungs the angels of God ascended and descended , and on whose top the Lord himself leaned ; in that bush which Moses saw in the holy place burning on all sides , which was not consumed or injured in any way but grew green and blossomed beautifully ; in that impregnable tower before the enemy , from which hung a thousand bucklers and all the armor of the strong ; in that garden enclosed on all sides , which can not be violated or corrupted by any deceitful plots ; in that resplendent city of God , which has its foundations on the holy mountains ; in that most august temple of God , which , radiant with divine splendours , is full of the glory of God ; and in very many other biblical types of this kind . "
The theologians , including Zwingli , Melanchthon , Martin Bucer , and Johannes Oecolampadius , differed on the significance of the words spoken by Jesus at the Last Supper : " This is my body which is for you " and " This cup is the new covenant in my blood " ( 1 Corinthians 11:23–26 ) . Luther insisted on the Real Presence of the body and blood of Christ in the consecrated bread and wine , which he called the sacramental union , while his opponents believed God to be only spiritually or symbolically present . Zwingli , for example , denied Jesus ' ability to be in more than one place at a time but Luther stressed the omnipresence of his human nature . According to transcripts , the debate sometimes became confrontational . Citing Jesus ' words " The flesh profiteth nothing " ( John 6.63 ) , Zwingli said , " This passage breaks your neck " . " Do n't be too proud , " Luther retorted , " German necks do n't break that easily . This is Hesse , not Switzerland . " On his table Luther wrote the words " Hoc est corpus meum " ( " This is my body " ) in chalk , to continually indicate his firm stance .
In mid May 1967 , the Soviet Union issued warnings to Nasser of an impending Israeli attack on Syria . Although the chief of staff Mohamed Fawzi verified them as " baseless " , Nasser took three successive steps that made the war virtually inevitable : On 14 May he deployed his troops in Sinai near the border with Israel , on 19 May he expelled the UN peacekeepers stationed in the Sinai Peninsula border with Israel , and on 23 May he closed the Straits of Tiran to Israeli shipping . On 26 May Nasser declared , " The battle will be a general one and our basic objective will be to destroy Israel " .
The game 's media day , which was typically held on the Tuesday afternoon prior to the game , was moved to the Monday evening and re-branded as Super Bowl Opening Night . The event was held on February 1 , 2016 at SAP Center in San Jose . Alongside the traditional media availabilities , the event featured an opening ceremony with player introductions on a replica of the Golden Gate Bridge .
By the 1900s , nigger had become a pejorative word in the United States . In its stead , the term colored became the mainstream alternative to negro and its derived terms . After the African-American Civil rights movement , the terms colored and negro gave way to " black " . Negro had superseded colored as the most polite word for African Americans at a time when black was considered more offensive . This term was accepted as normal , including by people classified as Negroes , until the later Civil Rights movement in the late 1960s . One well-known example is the identification by Reverend Martin Luther King , Jr. of his own race as " Negro " in his famous speech of 1963 , I Have a Dream . During the American Civil Rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s , some African-American leaders in the United States , notably Malcolm X , objected to the word Negro because they associated it with the long history of slavery , segregation , and discrimination that treated African Americans as second-class citizens , or worse . Malcolm X preferred Black to Negro , but later gradually abandoned that as well for Afro-American after leaving the Nation of Islam .
Black people is a term used in certain countries , often in socially based systems of racial classification or of ethnicity , to describe persons who are perceived to be dark-skinned compared to other given populations . As such , the meaning of the expression varies widely both between and within societies , and depends significantly on context . For many other individuals , communities and countries , " black " is also perceived as a derogatory , outdated , reductive or otherwise unrepresentative label , and as a result is neither used nor defined .
Hard rock is a form of loud , aggressive rock music . The electric guitar is often emphasised , used with distortion and other effects , both as a rhythm instrument using repetitive riffs with a varying degree of complexity , and as a solo lead instrument . Drumming characteristically focuses on driving rhythms , strong bass drum and a backbeat on snare , sometimes using cymbals for emphasis . The bass guitar works in conjunction with the drums , occasionally playing riffs , but usually providing a backing for the rhythm and lead guitars . Vocals are often growling , raspy , or involve screaming or wailing , sometimes in a high range , or even falsetto voice .
Sony Music Entertainment Inc. ( sometimes known as Sony Music or by the initials , SME ) is an American music corporation managed and operated by Sony Corporation of America ( SCA ) , a subsidiary of Japanese conglomerate Sony Corporation . In 1929 , the enterprise was first founded as American Record Corporation ( ARC ) and , in 1938 , was renamed Columbia Recording Corporation , following ARC 's acquisition by CBS . In 1966 , the company was reorganized to become CBS Records . In 1987 , Sony Corporation of Japan bought the company , and in 1991 , renamed it SME . It is the world 's second largest recorded music company , after Universal Music Group .
Luther 's writings circulated widely , reaching France , England , and Italy as early as 1519 . Students thronged to Wittenberg to hear Luther speak . He published a short commentary on Galatians and his Work on the Psalms . This early part of Luther 's career was one of his most creative and productive . Three of his best-known works were published in 1520 : To the Christian Nobility of the German Nation , On the Babylonian Captivity of the Church , and On the Freedom of a Christian .
In 1975 , Sadat shifted Nasser 's economic policies and sought to use his popularity to reduce government regulations and encourage foreign investment through his program of Infitah . Through this policy , incentives such as reduced taxes and import tariffs attracted some investors , but investments were mainly directed at low risk and profitable ventures like tourism and construction , abandoning Egypt 's infant industries . Even though Sadat 's policy was intended to modernise Egypt and assist the middle class , it mainly benefited the higher class , and , because of the elimination of subsidies on basic foodstuffs , led to the 1977 Egyptian Bread Riots .
The Charaka Samhita , thought to have been written between 300 and 500 AD , mentions a metal which , when oxidized , produces pushpanjan , thought to be zinc oxide . Zinc mines at Zawar , near Udaipur in India , have been active since the Mauryan period . The smelting of metallic zinc here , however , appears to have begun around the 12th century AD . One estimate is that this location produced an estimated million tonnes of metallic zinc and zinc oxide from the 12th to 16th centuries . Another estimate gives a total production of 60,000 tonnes of metallic zinc over this period . The Rasaratna Samuccaya , written in approximately the 13th century AD , mentions two types of zinc-containing ores : one used for metal extraction and another used for medicinal purposes .
The celebrated John Duns Scotus ( d. 1308 ) , a Friar Minor like Saint Bonaventure , argued , on the contrary , that from a rational point of view it was certainly as little derogatory to the merits of Christ to assert that Mary was by him preserved from all taint of sin , as to say that she first contracted it and then was delivered . Proposing a solution to the theological problem of reconciling the doctrine with that of universal redemption in Christ , he argued that Mary 's immaculate conception did not remove her from redemption by Christ ; rather it was the result of a more perfect redemption granted her because of her special role in salvation history .
In 1521 Luther dealt largely with prophecy , in which he broadened the foundations of the Reformation placing them on prophetic faith . His main interest was centered on the prophecy of the Little Horn in Daniel 8:9–12 , 23–25 . The antichrist of 2 Thessalonians 2 was identified as the power of the Papacy . So too was the Little Horn of Daniel 7 , coming up among the divisions of Rome , explicitly applied .
Luther 's other major works on the Jews were his 60,000-word treatise Von den Juden und Ihren Lügen ( On the Jews and Their Lies ) , and Vom Schem Hamphoras und vom Geschlecht Christi ( On the Holy Name and the Lineage of Christ ) , both published in 1543 , three years before his death . Luther argued that the Jews were no longer the chosen people but " the devil 's people " , and referred to them with violent , vile language . Citing Deuteronomy 13 , wherein Moses commands the killing of idolaters and the burning of their cities and property as an offering to God , Luther called for a " scharfe Barmherzigkeit " ( " sharp mercy " ) against the Jews " to see whether we might save at least a few from the glowing flames . " Luther advocated setting synagogues on fire , destroying Jewish prayerbooks , forbidding rabbis from preaching , seizing Jews ' property and money , and smashing up their homes , so that these " envenomed worms " would be forced into labour or expelled " for all time " . In Robert Michael 's view , Luther 's words " We are at fault in not slaying them " amounted to a sanction for murder . " God 's anger with them is so intense , " Luther concluded , " that gentle mercy will only tend to make them worse , while sharp mercy will reform them but little . Therefore , in any case , away with them ! "
Football is the most popular national sport of Egypt . The Cairo Derby is one of the fiercest derbies in Africa , and the BBC picked it as one of the 7 toughest derbies in the world . Al Ahly is the most successful club of the 20th century in the African continent according to CAF , closely followed by their rivals Zamalek SC . Al Ahly was named in 2000 by the Confederation of African Football as the " African Club of the Century " . With twenty titles , Al Ahly is currently the world 's most successful club in terms of international trophies , surpassing Italy 's A.C. Milan and Argentina 's Boca Juniors , both having eighteen .
After a punt from both teams , Carolina got on track with a 9-play , 73-yard scoring drive . Newton completed 4 of 4 passes for 51 yards and rushed twice for 25 yards , while Jonathan Stewart finished the drive with a 1-yard touchdown run , cutting the score to 10–7 with 11:28 left in the second quarter . Later on , Broncos receiver Jordan Norwood received Brad Nortman 's short 28-yard punt surrounded by Panthers players , but none of them attempted to make a tackle , apparently thinking Norwood had called a fair catch . Norwood had not done so , and with no resistance around him , he took off for a Super Bowl record 61-yard return before Mario Addison dragged him down on the Panthers 14-yard line . Despite Denver 's excellent field position , they could not get the ball into the end zone , so McManus kicked a 33-yard field goal that increased their lead to 13–7 .
Cairo University is ranked as 401-500 according to the Academic Ranking of World Universities ( Shanghai Ranking ) and 551-600 according to QS World University Rankings . American University in Cairo is ranked as 360 according to QS World University Rankings and Al-Azhar University , Alexandria University and Ain Shams University fall in the 701+ range . Egypt is currently opening new research institutes for the aim of modernising research in the nation , the most recent example of which is Zewail City of Science and Technology .
With over 90 million inhabitants , Egypt is the most populous country in North Africa and the Arab World , the third-most populous in Africa ( after Nigeria and Ethiopia ) , and the fifteenth-most populous in the world . The great majority of its people live near the banks of the Nile River , an area of about 40,000 square kilometres ( 15,000 sq mi ) , where the only arable land is found . The large regions of the Sahara desert , which constitute most of Egypt 's territory , are sparsely inhabited . About half of Egypt 's residents live in urban areas , with most spread across the densely populated centres of greater Cairo , Alexandria and other major cities in the Nile Delta .
This was the first Super Bowl to feature a quarterback on both teams who was the # 1 pick in their draft classes . Manning was the # 1 selection of the 1998 NFL draft , while Newton was picked first in 2011 . The matchup also pits the top two picks of the 2011 draft against each other : Newton for Carolina and Von Miller for Denver . Manning and Newton also set the record for the largest age difference between opposing Super Bowl quarterbacks at 13 years and 48 days ( Manning was 39 , Newton was 26 ) .
Genetic studies have found significant African female-mediated gene flow in Arab communities in the Arabian Peninsula and neighboring countries , with an average of 38 % of maternal lineages in Yemen are of direct African descent , 16 % in Oman-Qatar , and 10 % in Saudi Arabia-United Arab Emirates .
Columbia founded Epic Records in 1953 . In 1956 , Conkling left Columbia , he would help establish the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences before eventually becoming the first president of the newly launched Warner Bros. Records , and Goddard Lieberson began the first of two stints as head of the record company . In 1958 , Columbia founded another label , Date Records , which initially issued rockabilly music .
The mandolin has been used extensively in the traditional music of England and Scotland for generations . Simon Mayor is a prominent British player who has produced six solo albums , instructional books and DVDs , as well as recordings with his mandolin quartet the Mandolinquents . The instrument has also found its way into British rock music . The mandolin was played by Mike Oldfield ( and introduced by Vivian Stanshall ) on Oldfield 's album Tubular Bells , as well as on a number of his subsequent albums ( particularly prominently on Hergest Ridge ( 1974 ) and Ommadawn ( 1975 ) ) . It was used extensively by the British folk-rock band Lindisfarne , who featured two members on the instrument , Ray Jackson and Simon Cowe , and whose " Fog on the Tyne " was the biggest selling UK album of 1971-1972 . The instrument was also used extensively in the UK folk revival of the 1960s and 1970s with bands such as Fairport Convention and Steeleye Span taking it on as the lead instrument in many of their songs . Maggie May by Rod Stewart , which hit No . 1 on both the British charts and the Billboard Hot 100 , also featured Jackson 's playing . It has also been used by other British rock musicians . Led Zeppelin 's bassist John Paul Jones is an accomplished mandolin player and has recorded numerous songs on mandolin including Going to California and That 's the Way ; the mandolin part on The Battle of Evermore is played by Jimmy Page , who composed the song . Other Led Zeppelin songs featuring mandolin are Hey Hey What Can I Do , and Black Country Woman . Pete Townshend of The Who played mandolin on the track Mike Post Theme , along with many other tracks on Endless Wire . McGuinness Flint , for whom Graham Lyle played the mandolin on their most successful single , When I 'm Dead And Gone , is another example . Lyle was also briefly a member of Ronnie Lane 's Slim Chance , and played mandolin on their hit How Come . One of the more prominent early mandolin players in popular music was Robin Williamson in The Incredible String Band . Ian Anderson of Jethro Tull is a highly accomplished mandolin player ( beautiful track Pussy Willow ) , as is his guitarist Martin Barre . The popular song Please Please Please Let Me Get What I Want by The Smiths featured a mandolin solo played by Johnny Marr . More recently , the Glasgow-based band Sons and Daughters featured the mandolin , played by Ailidh Lennon , on tracks such as Fight , Start to End , and Medicine . British folk-punk icons the Levellers also regularly use the mandolin in their songs . Current bands are also beginning to use the Mandolin and its unique sound - such as South London 's Indigo Moss who use it throughout their recordings and live gigs . The mandolin has also featured in the playing of Matthew Bellamy in the rock band Muse . It also forms the basis of Paul McCartney 's 2007 hit " Dance Tonight . " That was not the first time a Beatle played a mandolin , however ; that distinction goes to George Harrison on Gone Troppo , the title cut from the 1982 album of the same name . The mandolin is taught in Lanarkshire by the Lanarkshire Guitar and Mandolin Association to over 100 people . Also more recently hard rock supergroup Them Crooked Vultures have been playing a song based primarily using a mandolin . This song was left off their debut album , and features former Led Zeppelin bassist John Paul Jones . [ citation needed ]
Martin Luther was born to Hans Luder ( or Ludher , later Luther ) and his wife Margarethe ( née Lindemann ) on 10 November 1483 in Eisleben , Saxony , then part of the Holy Roman Empire . He was baptized as a Catholic the next morning on the feast day of St. Martin of Tours . His family moved to Mansfeld in 1484 , where his father was a leaseholder of copper mines and smelters and served as one of four citizen representatives on the local council . The religious scholar Martin Marty describes Luther 's mother as a hard-working woman of " trading-class stock and middling means " and notes that Luther 's enemies later wrongly described her as a whore and bath attendant . He had several brothers and sisters , and is known to have been close to one of them , Jacob . Hans Luther was ambitious for himself and his family , and he was determined to see Martin , his eldest son , become a lawyer . He sent Martin to Latin schools in Mansfeld , then Magdeburg in 1497 , where he attended a school operated by a lay group called the Brethren of the Common Life , and Eisenach in 1498 . The three schools focused on the so-called " trivium " : grammar , rhetoric , and logic . Luther later compared his education there to purgatory and hell .
According to UNFPA these elements promote the right of " reproductive health " , that is physical , mental , and social health in matters related to reproduction and the reproductive system .
The production for sulfidic zinc ores produces large amounts of sulfur dioxide and cadmium vapor . Smelter slag and other residues of process also contain significant amounts of heavy metals . About 1.1 million tonnes of metallic zinc and 130 thousand tonnes of lead were mined and smelted in the Belgian towns of La Calamine and Plombières between 1806 and 1882 . The dumps of the past mining operations leach significant amounts of zinc and cadmium , and , as a result , the sediments of the Geul River contain significant amounts of heavy metals . About two thousand years ago emissions of zinc from mining and smelting totaled 10 thousand tonnes a year . After increasing 10-fold from 1850 , zinc emissions peaked at 3.4 million tonnes per year in the 1980s and declined to 2.7 million tonnes in the 1990s , although a 2005 study of the Arctic troposphere found that the concentrations there did not reflect the decline . Anthropogenic and natural emissions occur at a ratio of 20 to 1 .
At the time of the fall of the Egyptian monarchy in the early 1950s , less than half a million Egyptians were considered upper class and rich , four million middle class and 17 million lower class and poor . Fewer than half of all primary-school-age children attended school , most of them being boys . Nasser 's policies changed this . Land reform and distribution , the dramatic growth in university education , and government support to national industries greatly improved social mobility and flattened the social curve . From academic year 1953-54 through 1965-66 , overall public school enrolments more than doubled . Millions of previously poor Egyptians , through education and jobs in the public sector , joined the middle class . Doctors , engineers , teachers , lawyers , journalists , constituted the bulk of the swelling middle class in Egypt under Nasser . During the 1960s , the Egyptian economy went from sluggish to the verge of collapse , the society became less free , and Nasser 's appeal waned considerably .
According to scholars Walter Krämer , Götz Trenkler , Gerhard Ritter , and Gerhard Prause , the story of the posting on the door , even though it has settled as one of the pillars of history , has little foundation in truth . The story is based on comments made by Philipp Melanchthon , though it is thought that he was not in Wittenberg at the time .
The Panthers used the San Jose State practice facility and stayed at the San Jose Marriott . The Broncos practiced at Stanford University and stayed at the Santa Clara Marriott .
Pope Sixtus V limited the number of cardinals to 70 , comprising six cardinal bishops , 50 cardinal priests , and 14 cardinal deacons . Starting in the pontificate of Pope John XXIII , that limit has been exceeded . At the start of 1971 , Pope Paul VI set the number of cardinal electors at a maximum of 120 , but set no limit on the number of cardinals generally . He also established a maximum age of eighty years for electors . His action deprived twenty-five living cardinals , including the three living cardinals elevated by Pope Pius XI , of the right to participate in a conclave . [ citation needed ] Popes can dispense from church laws and have sometimes brought the number of cardinals under the age of 80 to more than 120 . Pope Paul VI also increased the number of cardinal bishops by giving that rank to patriarchs of the Eastern Catholic Churches .
Zinc is an essential mineral perceived by the public today as being of " exceptional biologic and public health importance " , especially regarding prenatal and postnatal development . Zinc deficiency affects about two billion people in the developing world and is associated with many diseases . In children it causes growth retardation , delayed sexual maturation , infection susceptibility , and diarrhea . Enzymes with a zinc atom in the reactive center are widespread in biochemistry , such as alcohol dehydrogenase in humans . Consumption of excess zinc can cause ataxia , lethargy and copper deficiency .
Although Foo Fighters continued to be one of the most successful rock acts , with albums like In Your Honor ( 2005 ) reaching number two in the US and UK , many of the first wave of post-grunge bands began to fade in popularity . Acts like Creed , Staind , Puddle of Mudd and Nickelback took the genre into the 2000s with considerable commercial success , abandoning most of the angst and anger of the original movement for more conventional anthems , narratives and romantic songs . They were followed in this vein by new acts including Shinedown and Seether . Acts with more conventional hard rock sounds included Andrew W.K. , Beautiful Creatures and Buckcherry , whose breakthrough album 15 ( 2006 ) went platinum and spawned the single " Sorry " ( 2007 ) , which made the Top 10 of the Billboard 100 . These were joined by bands with hard rock leanings that emerged in the mid-2000s from the garage rock or post punk revival , including Black Rebel Motorcycle Club and Kings of Leon , and Queens of the Stone Age from the US , Three Days Grace from Canada , Jet from Australia and The Datsuns from New Zealand . In 2009 Them Crooked Vultures , a supergroup that brought together Foo Fighters ' Dave Grohl , Queens of the Stone Age 's Josh Homme and Led Zeppelin bass player John Paul Jones attracted attention as a live act and released a self-titled debut album that reached the top 20 in the US and UK and the top ten in several other countries .
Of the Christian minority in Egypt over 90 % belong to the native Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria , an Oriental Orthodox Christian Church . Other native Egyptian Christians are adherents of the Coptic Catholic Church , the Evangelical Church of Egypt and various other Protestant denominations . Non-native Christian communities are largely found in the urban regions of Cairo and Alexandria , such as the Syro-Lebanese , who belong to Greek Catholic , Greek Orthodox , and Maronite Catholic denominations .

As a non-directive and flexible analytical tool , the concept of boundaries helps both to map and to define the changeability and mutability that are characteristic of people 's experiences of the self in society . While identity is a volatile , flexible and abstract 'thing ' , its manifestations and the ways in which it is exercised are often open to view . Identity is made evident through the use of markers such as language , dress , behaviour and choice of space , whose effect depends on their recognition by other social beings . Markers help to create the boundaries that define similarities or differences between the marker wearer and the marker perceivers , their effectiveness depends on a shared understanding of their meaning . In a social context , misunderstandings can arise due to a misinterpretation of the significance of specific markers . Equally , an individual can use markers of identity to exert influence on other people without necessarily fulfilling all the criteria that an external observer might typically associate with such an abstract identity .
In addition to the Vince Lombardi Trophy that all Super Bowl champions receive , the winner of Super Bowl 50 will also receive a large , 18-karat gold-plated " 50 " . Each digit will weigh 33 lb ( 15 kg ) for a total of 66 lb ( 30 kg ) . Like the Lombardi Trophy , the " 50 " will be designed by Tiffany & Co .
According to the commentators , Virgil received his first education when he was five years old and he later went to Cremona , Milan , and finally Rome to study rhetoric , medicine , and astronomy , which he soon abandoned for philosophy . From Virgil 's admiring references to the neoteric writers Pollio and Cinna , it has been inferred that he was , for a time , associated with Catullus ' neoteric circle . However schoolmates considered Virgil extremely shy and reserved , according to Servius , and he was nicknamed " Parthenias " or " maiden " because of his social aloofness . Virgil seems to have suffered bad health throughout his life and in some ways lived the life of an invalid . According to the Catalepton , while in the Epicurean school of Siro the Epicurean at Naples , he began to write poetry . A group of small works attributed to the youthful Virgil by the commentators survive collected under the title Appendix Vergiliana , but are largely considered spurious by scholars . One , the Catalepton , consists of fourteen short poems , some of which may be Virgil 's , and another , a short narrative poem titled the Culex ( " The Gnat " ) , was attributed to Virgil as early as the 1st century AD .
The flagship stations of each station in the markets of each team will carry their local play-by-play calls . In Denver , KOA ( 850 AM ) and KRFX ( 103.5 FM ) will carry the game , with Dave Logan on play-by-play and Ed McCaffrey on color commentary . In North Carolina , WBT ( 1110 AM ) will carry the game , with Mick Mixon on play-by-play and Eugene Robinson and Jim Szoke on color commentary . WBT will also simulcast the game on its sister station WBT-FM ( 99.3 FM ) , which is based in Chester , South Carolina . As KOA and WBT are both clear-channel stations , the local broadcasts will be audible over much of the western United States after sunset ( for Denver ) and the eastern United States throughout the game ( for Carolina ) . In accordance with contractual rules , the rest of the stations in the Broncos and Panthers radio networks will either carry the Westwood One feed or not carry the game at all .
Peyton Manning became the first quarterback ever to lead two different teams to multiple Super Bowls . He is also the oldest quarterback ever to play in a Super Bowl at age 39 . The past record was held by John Elway , who led the Broncos to victory in Super Bowl XXXIII at age 38 and is currently Denver 's Executive Vice President of Football Operations and General Manager .
On June 4 , 2014 , the NFL announced that the practice of branding Super Bowl games with Roman numerals , a practice established at Super Bowl V , would be temporarily suspended , and that the game would be named using Arabic numerals as Super Bowl 50 as opposed to Super Bowl L. The use of Roman numerals will be reinstated for Super Bowl LI . Jaime Weston , the league 's vice president of brand and creative , explained that a primary reason for the change was the difficulty of designing an aesthetically pleasing logo with the letter " L " using the standardized logo template introduced at Super Bowl XLV . The logo also deviates from the template by featuring large numerals , colored in gold , behind the Vince Lombardi Trophy , instead of underneath and in silver as in the standard logo .
The structure known as " Virgil 's tomb " is found at the entrance of an ancient Roman tunnel ( also known as " grotta vecchia " ) in Piedigrotta , a district two miles from the centre of Naples , near the Mergellina harbor , on the road heading north along the coast to Pozzuoli . While Virgil was already the object of literary admiration and veneration before his death , in the Middle Ages his name became associated with miraculous powers , and for a couple of centuries his tomb was the destination of pilgrimages and veneration .
The implications are multiple as various research traditions are now [ when ? ] heavily utilizing the lens of identity to examine phenomena . [ citation needed ] One implication of identity and of identity construction can be seen in occupational settings . This becomes increasing challenging in stigmatized jobs or " dirty work " ( Hughes , 1951 ) . Tracy and Trethewey ( 2005 ) state that " individuals gravitate toward and turn away from particular jobs depending in part , on the extent to which they validate a " preferred organizational self " ( Tracy & Tretheway 2005 , p. 169 ) . Some jobs carry different stigmas or acclaims . In her analysis Tracy uses the example of correctional officers trying to shake the stigma of " glorified maids " ( Tracy & Tretheway 2005 ) . " The process by which people arrive at justifications of and values for various occupational choices . " Among these are workplace satisfaction and overall quality of life ( Tracy & Scott 2006 , p. 33 ) . People in these types of jobs are forced to find ways in order to create an identity they can live with . " Crafting a positive sense of self at work is more challenging when one 's work is considered " dirty " by societal standards " ( Tracy & Scott 2006 , p. 7 ) . " In other words , doing taint management is not just about allowing the employee to feel good in that job . " If employees must navigate discourses that question the viability of their work , and/ or experience obstacles in managing taint through transforming dirty work into a badge of honor , it is likely they will find blaming the client to be an efficacious route in affirming their identity " ( Tracy & Scott 2006 , p. 33 ) .

With over 90 million inhabitants , Egypt is the most populous country in North Africa and the Arab World , the third-most populous in Africa ( after Nigeria and Ethiopia ) , and the fifteenth-most populous in the world . The great majority of its people live near the banks of the Nile River , an area of about 40,000 square kilometres ( 15,000 sq mi ) , where the only arable land is found . The large regions of the Sahara desert , which constitute most of Egypt 's territory , are sparsely inhabited . About half of Egypt 's residents live in urban areas , with most spread across the densely populated centres of greater Cairo , Alexandria and other major cities in the Nile Delta .
From the years 1500 to 1850 , an estimated 3.5 million captives were forcibly shipped from West/Central Africa to Brazil ; the territory received the highest number of slaves of any country in the Americas . Scholars estimate that more than half of the Brazilian population is at least in part descended from these individuals . Brazil has the largest population of Afro-descendants outside of Africa . In contrast to the US , during the slavery period and after , the Portuguese colonial government and later Brazilian government did not pass formal anti-miscegenation or segregation laws . As in other Latin countries , intermarriage was prevalent during the colonial period and continued afterward . In addition , people of mixed race ( pardo ) often tended to marry white , and their descendants became accepted as white . As a result , some of the European descended population also has West African or Amerindian blood . According to the last census of the 20th century , in which Brazilians could choose from five color/ethnic categories with which they identified , 54 % of individuals identified as white , 6.2 % identified as black , and 39.5 % identified as pardo ( brown ) — a broad multi-racial category , including tri-racial persons .
The Sustainable Development Goals are ambitious , and they will require enormous efforts across countries , continents , industries and disciplines - but they are achievable . UNFPA is working with governments , partners and other UN agencies to directly tackle many of these goals - in particular Goal 3 on health , Goal 4 on education and Goal 5 on gender equality - and contributes in a variety of ways to achieving many of the rest .
In the US , African Americans , who include multiracial people , earn 75 % of what white people earn . In Brazil , people of color earn less than 50 % of what whites earn . Some have posited that the facts of lower socioeconomic status for people of color suggest that Brazil practices a kind of one-drop rule , or discrimination against people who are not visibly European in ancestry . The gap in income between blacks and other non-whites is relatively small compared to the large gap between whites and all people of color . Other social factors , such as illiteracy and education levels , show the same patterns of disadvantage for people of color . Some commentators observe that the United States practice of segregation and white supremacy in the South , and discrimination in many areas outside that region , forced many African Americans to unite in the civil rights struggle . They suggest that the fluid nature of race in Brazil has divided individuals of African descent , between those with more or less ancestry . As a result , they have not united for a stronger civil rights movement . [ citation needed ]
The UNFPA supports programs in more than 150 countries , territories and areas spread across four geographic regions : Arab States and Europe , Asia and the Pacific , Latin America and the Caribbean , and sub-Saharan Africa . Around three quarters of the staff work in the field . It is a member of the United Nations Development Group and part of its Executive Committee .
In 1630 , Pope Urban VIII decreed their title to be Eminence ( previously , it had been " illustrissimo " and " reverendissimo " ) and decreed that their secular rank would equate to Prince , making them secondary only to the Pope and crowned monarchs .
From the late 19th century , the South used a colloquial term , the one-drop rule , to classify as black a person of any known African ancestry . This practice of hypodescent was not put into law until the early 20th century . Legally the definition varied from state to state . Racial definition was more flexible in the 18th and 19th centuries before the American Civil War . For instance , President Thomas Jefferson held persons who were legally white ( less than 25 % black ) according to Virginia law at the time , but , because they were born to slave mothers , they were born into slavery , according to the principle of partus sequitur ventrem , which Virginia adopted into law in 1662 .
The popularity of this particular representation of The Immaculate Conception spread across the rest of Europe , and has since remained the best known artistic depiction of the concept : in a heavenly realm , moments after her creation , the spirit of Mary ( in the form of a young woman ) looks up in awe at ( or bows her head to ) God . The moon is under her feet and a halo of twelve stars surround her head , possibly a reference to " a woman clothed with the sun " from Revelation 12:1-2 . Additional imagery may include clouds , a golden light , and cherubs . In some paintings the cherubim are holding lilies and roses , flowers often associated with Mary .
The Ptolemaic Kingdom was a powerful Hellenistic state , extending from southern Syria in the east , to Cyrene to the west , and south to the frontier with Nubia . Alexandria became the capital city and a centre of Greek culture and trade . To gain recognition by the native Egyptian populace , they named themselves as the successors to the Pharaohs . The later Ptolemies took on Egyptian traditions , had themselves portrayed on public monuments in Egyptian style and dress , and participated in Egyptian religious life .
BSkyB initially charged additional subscription fees for using a Sky+ PVR with their service ; waiving the charge for subscribers whose package included two or more premium channels . This changed as from 1 July 2007 , and now customers that have Sky+ and subscribe to any BSkyB subscription package get Sky+ included at no extra charge . Customers that do not subscribe to BSkyB 's channels can still pay a monthly fee to enable Sky+ functions . In January 2010 BSkyB discontinued the Sky+ Box , limited the standard Sky Box to Multiroom upgrade only and started to issue the Sky+HD Box as standard , thus giving all new subscribers the functions of Sky+ . In February 2011 BSkyB discontinued the non-HD variant of its Multiroom box , offering a smaller version of the SkyHD box without Sky+ functionality . In September 2007 , Sky launched a new TV advertising campaign targeting Sky+ at women . As of 31 March 2008 , Sky had 3,393,000 Sky+ users .
Due to the Ottoman slave trade that had flourished in the Balkans , the coastal town of Ulcinj in Montenegro had its own black community . As a consequence of the slave trade and privateer activity , it is told how until 1878 in Ulcinj 100 black people lived . The Ottoman Army also deployed an estimated 30,000 Black African troops and cavalrymen to its expedition in Hungary during the Austro-Turkish War of 1716–18 .
Although the self is distinct from identity , the literature of self-psychology can offer some insight into how identity is maintained ( Cote & Levin 2002 , p. 24 ) . From the vantage point of self-psychology , there are two areas of interest : the processes by which a self is formed ( the " I " ) , and the actual content of the schemata which compose the self-concept ( the " Me " ) . In the latter field , theorists have shown interest in relating the self-concept to self-esteem , the differences between complex and simple ways of organizing self-knowledge , and the links between those organizing principles and the processing of information ( Cote & Levin 2002 ) .
The Charaka Samhita , thought to have been written between 300 and 500 AD , mentions a metal which , when oxidized , produces pushpanjan , thought to be zinc oxide . Zinc mines at Zawar , near Udaipur in India , have been active since the Mauryan period . The smelting of metallic zinc here , however , appears to have begun around the 12th century AD . One estimate is that this location produced an estimated million tonnes of metallic zinc and zinc oxide from the 12th to 16th centuries . Another estimate gives a total production of 60,000 tonnes of metallic zinc over this period . The Rasaratna Samuccaya , written in approximately the 13th century AD , mentions two types of zinc-containing ores : one used for metal extraction and another used for medicinal purposes .
The Panthers offense , which led the NFL in scoring ( 500 points ) , was loaded with talent , boasting six Pro Bowl selections . Pro Bowl quarterback Cam Newton had one of his best seasons , throwing for 3,837 yards and rushing for 636 , while recording a career-high and league-leading 45 total touchdowns ( 35 passing , 10 rushing ) , a career-low 10 interceptions , and a career-best quarterback rating of 99.4 . Newton 's leading receivers were tight end Greg Olsen , who caught a career-high 77 passes for 1,104 yards and seven touchdowns , and wide receiver Ted Ginn , Jr. , who caught 44 passes for 739 yards and 10 touchdowns ; Ginn also rushed for 60 yards and returned 27 punts for 277 yards . Other key receivers included veteran Jerricho Cotchery ( 39 receptions for 485 yards ) , rookie Devin Funchess ( 31 receptions for 473 yards and five touchdowns ) , and second-year receiver Corey Brown ( 31 receptions for 447 yards ) . The Panthers backfield featured Pro Bowl running back Jonathan Stewart , who led the team with 989 rushing yards and six touchdowns in 13 games , along with Pro Bowl fullback Mike Tolbert , who rushed for 256 yards and caught 18 passes for another 154 yards . Carolina 's offensive line also featured two Pro Bowl selections : center Ryan Kalil and guard Trai Turner .
The opening years of the 1980s saw a number of changes in personnel and direction of established hard rock acts , including the deaths of Bon Scott , the lead singer of AC/DC , and John Bonham , drummer with Led Zeppelin . Whereas Zeppelin broke up almost immediately afterwards , AC/DC pressed on , recording the album Back in Black ( 1980 ) with their new lead singer , Brian Johnson . It became the fifth-highest-selling album of all time in the US and the second-highest-selling album in the world . Black Sabbath had split with original singer Ozzy Osbourne in 1979 and replaced him with Ronnie James Dio , formerly of Rainbow , giving the band a new sound and a period of creativity and popularity beginning with Heaven and Hell ( 1980 ) . Osbourne embarked on a solo career with Blizzard of Ozz ( 1980 ) , featuring American guitarist Randy Rhoads . Some bands , such as Queen , moved away from their hard rock roots and more towards pop rock , while others , including Rush with Moving Pictures ( 1981 ) , began to return to a hard rock sound . The creation of thrash metal , which mixed heavy metal with elements of hardcore punk from about 1982 , particularly by Metallica , Anthrax , Megadeth and Slayer , helped to create extreme metal and further remove the style from hard rock , although a number of these bands or their members would continue to record some songs closer to a hard rock sound . Kiss moved away from their hard rock roots toward pop metal : firstly removing their makeup in 1983 for their Lick It Up album , and then adopting the visual and sound of glam metal for their 1984 release , Animalize , both of which marked a return to commercial success . Pat Benatar was one of the first women to achieve commercial success in hard rock , with three successive Top 5 albums between 1980 and 1982 .
There are many important organozinc compounds . Organozinc chemistry is the science of organozinc compounds describing their physical properties , synthesis and reactions . Among important applications is the Frankland-Duppa Reaction in which an oxalate ester ( ROCOCOOR ) reacts with an alkyl halide R'X , zinc and hydrochloric acid to the α-hydroxycarboxylic esters RR'COHCOOR , the Reformatskii reaction which converts α-halo-esters and aldehydes to β-hydroxy-esters , the Simmons–Smith reaction in which the carbenoid ( iodomethyl ) zinc iodide reacts with alkene ( or alkyne ) and converts them to cyclopropane , the Addition reaction of organozinc compounds to carbonyl compounds . The Barbier reaction ( 1899 ) is the zinc equivalent of the magnesium Grignard reaction and is better of the two . In presence of just about any water the formation of the organomagnesium halide will fail , whereas the Barbier reaction can even take place in water . On the downside organozincs are much less nucleophilic than Grignards , are expensive and difficult to handle . Commercially available diorganozinc compounds are dimethylzinc , diethylzinc and diphenylzinc . In one study the active organozinc compound is obtained from much cheaper organobromine precursors :
In the first 200 years that black people were in the United States , they primarily identified themselves by their specific ethnic group ( closely allied to language ) and not by skin color . Individuals identified themselves , for example , as Ashanti , Igbo , Bakongo , or Wolof . However , when the first captives were brought to the Americas , they were often combined with other groups from West Africa , and individual ethnic affiliations were not generally acknowledged by English colonists . In areas of the Upper South , different ethnic groups were brought together . This is significant as the captives came from a vast geographic region : the West African coastline stretching from Senegal to Angola and in some cases from the south-east coast such as Mozambique . A new African-American identity and culture was born that incorporated elements of the various ethnic groups and of European cultural heritage , resulting in fusions such as the Black church and Black English . This new identity was based on provenance and slave status rather than membership in any one ethnic group . [ citation needed ] By contrast , slave records from Louisiana show that the French and Spanish colonists recorded more complete identities of the West Africans , including ethnicities and given tribal names .
In his 1805 mandolin method , Anweisung die Mandoline von selbst zu erlernen nebst einigen Uebungsstucken von Bortolazzi , Bartolomeo Bortolazzi popularised the Cremonese mandolin , which had four single-strings and a fixed bridge , to which the strings were attached . Bortolazzi said in this book that the new wire strung mandolins were uncomfortable to play , when compared with the gut-string instruments . Also , he felt they had a " less pleasing ... hard , zither-like tone " as compared to the gut string 's " softer , full-singing tone . " He favored the four single strings of the Cremonese instrument , which were tuned the same as the Neapolitan .
Other scholars argue that , even if his views were merely anti-Judaic—that is , opposed to Judaism and its adherence rather than the Jews as an ethnic group—their violence lent a new element to the standard Christian suspicion of Judaism . Ronald Berger writes that Luther is credited with " Germanizing the Christian critique of Judaism and establishing anti-Semitism as a key element of German culture and national identity . " Paul Rose argues that he caused a " hysterical and demonizing mentality " about Jews to enter German thought and discourse , a mentality that might otherwise have been absent . Christopher J. Probst in his book Demonizing the Jews : Luther and the Protestant Church in Nazi Germany ( 2012 ) , shows that a large number of German Lutheran clergy and theologians during the Nazi Third Reich used Luther 's hostile publications towards the Jews and their Jewish religion to justify at least in part the anti-Semitic policies of the National Socialists .
On 31 October 1517 , Luther wrote to his bishop , Albert of Mainz , protesting the sale of indulgences . He enclosed in his letter a copy of his " Disputation of Martin Luther on the Power and Efficacy of Indulgences " , which came to be known as The Ninety-Five Theses . Hans Hillerbrand writes that Luther had no intention of confronting the church , but saw his disputation as a scholarly objection to church practices , and the tone of the writing is accordingly " searching , rather than doctrinaire . " Hillerbrand writes that there is nevertheless an undercurrent of challenge in several of the theses , particularly in Thesis 86 , which asks : " Why does the pope , whose wealth today is greater than the wealth of the richest Crassus , build the basilica of St. Peter with the money of poor believers rather than with his own money ? "
In 2008 , the High Court in South Africa ruled that Chinese South Africans who were residents during the apartheid era ( and their descendants ) are to be reclassified as " Black people , " solely for the purposes of accessing affirmative action benefits , because they were also " disadvantaged " by racial discrimination . Chinese people who arrived in the country after the end of apartheid do not qualify for such benefits .
Egypt actively practices capital punishment . Egypt 's authorities do not release figures on death sentences and executions , despite repeated requests over the years by human rights organisations . The United Nations human rights office and various NGOs expressed " deep alarm " after an Egyptian Minya Criminal Court sentenced 529 people to death in a single hearing on 25 March 2014 . Sentenced supporters of former President Mohamed Morsi will be executed for their alleged role in violence following his ousting in July 2013 . The judgment was condemned as a violation of international law . By May 2014 , approximately 16,000 people ( and as high as more than 40,000 by one independent count ) , mostly Brotherhood members or supporters , have been imprisoned after the coup after the Muslim Brotherhood was labelled as terrorist organisation by the post-coup interim Egyptian government .
The earlier influence of temporal rulers , notably the French kings , reasserted itself through the influence of cardinals of certain nationalities or politically significant movements . Traditions even developed entitling certain monarchs , including those of Austria , Spain , and Portugal , to nominate one of their trusted clerical subjects to be created cardinal , a so-called crown-cardinal .

In the 1530s and 1540s , printed images of Luther that emphasized his monumental size were crucial to the spread of Protestantism . In contrast to images of frail Catholic saints , Luther was presented as a stout man with a " double chin , strong mouth , piercing deep-set eyes , fleshy face , and squat neck . " He was shown to be physically imposing , an equal in stature to the secular German princes with whom he would join forces to spread Lutheranism . His large body also let the viewer know that he did not shun earthly pleasures like drinking—behavior that was a stark contrast to the ascetic life of the medieval religious orders . Famous images from this period include the woodcuts by Hans Brosamer ( 1530 ) and Lucas Cranach the Elder and Lucas Cranach the Younger ( 1546 ) .
By the 1900s , nigger had become a pejorative word in the United States . In its stead , the term colored became the mainstream alternative to negro and its derived terms . After the African-American Civil rights movement , the terms colored and negro gave way to " black " . Negro had superseded colored as the most polite word for African Americans at a time when black was considered more offensive . This term was accepted as normal , including by people classified as Negroes , until the later Civil Rights movement in the late 1960s . One well-known example is the identification by Reverend Martin Luther King , Jr. of his own race as " Negro " in his famous speech of 1963 , I Have a Dream . During the American Civil Rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s , some African-American leaders in the United States , notably Malcolm X , objected to the word Negro because they associated it with the long history of slavery , segregation , and discrimination that treated African Americans as second-class citizens , or worse . Malcolm X preferred Black to Negro , but later gradually abandoned that as well for Afro-American after leaving the Nation of Islam .
In 1966 , CBS reorganized its corporate structure with Leiberson promoted to head the new " CBS-Columbia Group " which made the now renamed CBS Records company a separate unit of this new group run by Clive Davis .
Zinc is more reactive than iron or steel and thus will attract almost all local oxidation until it completely corrodes away . A protective surface layer of oxide and carbonate ( Zn 5 ( OH ) 6 ( CO 3 ) 2 ) forms as the zinc corrodes . This protection lasts even after the zinc layer is scratched but degrades through time as the zinc corrodes away . The zinc is applied electrochemically or as molten zinc by hot-dip galvanizing or spraying . Galvanization is used on chain-link fencing , guard rails , suspension bridges , lightposts , metal roofs , heat exchangers , and car bodies .
Roughly one quarter of all zinc output in the United States ( 2009 ) , is consumed in the form of zinc compounds ; a variety of which are used industrially . Zinc oxide is widely used as a white pigment in paints , and as a catalyst in the manufacture of rubber . It is also used as a heat disperser for the rubber and acts to protect its polymers from ultraviolet radiation ( the same UV protection is conferred to plastics containing zinc oxide ) . The semiconductor properties of zinc oxide make it useful in varistors and photocopying products . The zinc zinc-oxide cycle is a two step thermochemical process based on zinc and zinc oxide for hydrogen production .
The transition from the mandolino to the mandolin began around 1744 with the designing of the metal-string mandolin by the Vinaccia family , 3 brass strings and one of gut , using friction tuning pegs on a fingerboard that sat " flush " with the sound table . The mandolin grew in popularity over the next 60 years , in the streets where it was used by young men courting and by street musicians , and in the concert hall . After the Napoleonic Wars of 1815 , however , its popularity began to fall . The 19th century produced some prominent players , including Bartolomeo Bortolazzi of Venice and Pietro Vimercati . However , professional virtuosity was in decline , and the mandolin music changed as the mandolin became a folk instrument ; " the large repertoire of notated instrumental music for the mandolino and the mandoline was completely forgotten " . The export market for mandolins from Italy dried up around 1815 , and when Carmine de Laurentiis wrote a mandolin method in 1874 , the Music World magazine wrote that the mandolin was " out of date . " Salvador Léonardi mentioned this decline in his 1921 book , Méthode pour Banjoline ou Mandoline-Banjo , saying that the mandolin had been declining in popularity from previous times .
In the United States , the game was televised by CBS , as part of a cycle between the three main broadcast television partners of the NFL . The network 's lead broadcast team of Jim Nantz and Phil Simms called the contest , with Tracy Wolfson and Evan Washburn on the sidelines . CBS introduced new features during the telecast , including pylon cameras and microphones along with EyeVision 360—an array of 36 cameras along the upper deck that can be used to provide a 360-degree view of plays and " bullet time " effects . ( An earlier version of EyeVision was last used in Super Bowl XXXV ; for Super Bowl 50 , the cameras were upgraded to 5K resolution . )
The name of the metal was probably first documented by Paracelsus , a Swiss-born German alchemist , who referred to the metal as " zincum " or " zinken " in his book Liber Mineralium II , in the 16th century . The word is probably derived from the German zinke , and supposedly meant " tooth-like , pointed or jagged " ( metallic zinc crystals have a needle-like appearance ) . Zink could also imply " tin-like " because of its relation to German zinn meaning tin . Yet another possibility is that the word is derived from the Persian word سنگ seng meaning stone . The metal was also called Indian tin , tutanego , calamine , and spinter .
To fill this gap in the literature , mandolin orchestras have traditionally played many arrangements of music written for regular orchestras or other ensembles . Some players have sought out contemporary composers to solicit new works . Traditional mandolin orchestras remain especially popular in Japan and Germany , but also exist throughout the United States , Europe and the rest of the world . They perform works composed for mandolin family instruments , or re-orchestrations of traditional pieces . The structure of a contemporary traditional mandolin orchestra consists of : first and second mandolins , mandolas ( either octave mandolas , tuned an octave below the mandolin , or tenor mandolas , tuned like the viola ) , mandocellos ( tuned like the cello ) , and bass instruments ( conventional string bass or , rarely , mandobasses ) . Smaller ensembles , such as quartets composed of two mandolins , mandola , and mandocello , may also be found .
In early 1991 , non-Arabs of the Zaghawa tribe of Sudan attested that they were victims of an intensifying Arab apartheid campaign , segregating Arabs and non-Arabs ( specifically people of sub-Saharan African descent ) . Sudanese Arabs , who controlled the government , were widely referred to as practicing apartheid against Sudan 's non-Arab citizens . The government was accused of " deftly manipulat ( ing ) Arab solidarity " to carry out policies of apartheid and ethnic cleansing .
Other sources include fortified food and dietary supplements , which come in various forms . A 1998 review concluded that zinc oxide , one of the most common supplements in the United States , and zinc carbonate are nearly insoluble and poorly absorbed in the body . This review cited studies which found low plasma zinc concentrations after zinc oxide and zinc carbonate were consumed compared with those seen after consumption of zinc acetate and sulfate salts . However , harmful excessive supplementation is a problem among the relatively affluent , and should probably not exceed 20 mg/day in healthy people , although the U.S. National Research Council set a Tolerable Upper Intake of 40 mg/day .
Another family of bowlback mandolins came from Milan and Lombardy . These mandolins are closer to the mandolino or mandore than other modern mandolins . They are shorter and wider than the standard Neapolitan mandolin , with a shallow back . The instruments have 6 strings , 3 wire treble-strings and 3 gut or wire-wrapped-silk bass-strings . The strings ran between the tuning pegs and a bridge that was glued to the soundboard , as a guitar 's . The Lombardic mandolins were tuned g b e ' a ' d " g " . A developer of the Milanese stye was Antonio Monzino ( Milan ) and his family who made them for 6 generations .
The Byzantines were able to regain control of the country after a brief Sasanian Persian invasion early in the 7th century amidst the Byzantine–Sasanian War of 602–628 during which they established a new short-lived province for ten years known as Sasanian Egypt , until 639–42 , when Egypt was invaded and conquered by the Islamic Empire by the Muslim Arabs . When they defeated the Byzantine Armies in Egypt , the Arabs brought Sunni Islam to the country . Early in this period , Egyptians began to blend their new faith with indigenous beliefs and practices , leading to various Sufi orders that have flourished to this day . These earlier rites had survived the period of Coptic Christianity .
No archaeological evidence that indicates a settlement on the site of today′s city centre prior to the 12th century has been found so far . In antiquity , a Celtic oppidum stood on the Engehalbinsel ( peninsula ) north of Bern , fortified since the 2nd century BC ( late La Tène period ) , thought to be one of the twelve oppida of the Helvetii mentioned by Caesar . During the Roman era , there was a Gallo-Roman vicus on the same site . The Bern zinc tablet has the name Brenodor ( " dwelling of Breno " ) . In the Early Middle Ages , there was a settlement in Bümpliz , now a city district of Bern , some 4 km ( 2 mi ) from the medieval city .
Luther and his colleagues introduced the new order of worship during their visitation of the Electorate of Saxony , which began in 1527 . They also assessed the standard of pastoral care and Christian education in the territory . " Merciful God , what misery I have seen , " Luther wrote , " the common people knowing nothing at all of Christian doctrine ... and unfortunately many pastors are well-nigh unskilled and incapable of teaching . "
Luther devised the catechism as a method of imparting the basics of Christianity to the congregations . In 1529 , he wrote the Large Catechism , a manual for pastors and teachers , as well as a synopsis , the Small Catechism , to be memorised by the people themselves . The catechisms provided easy-to-understand instructional and devotional material on the Ten Commandments , the Apostles ' Creed , the Lord 's Prayer , baptism , and the Lord 's Supper . Luther incorporated questions and answers in the catechism so that the basics of Christian faith would not just be learned by rote , " the way monkeys do it " , but understood .
The international repertoire of music for mandolin is almost unlimited , and musicians use it to play various types of music . This is especially true of violin music , since the mandolin has the same tuning of the violin . Following its invention and early development in Italy the mandolin spread throughout the European continent . The instrument was primarily used in a classical tradition with Mandolin orchestras , so called Estudiantinas or in Germany Zupforchestern appearing in many cities . Following this continental popularity of the mandolin family local traditions appeared outside of Europe in the Americas and in Japan . Travelling mandolin virtuosi like Giuseppe Pettine , Raffaele Calace and Silvio Ranieri contributed to the mandolin becoming a " fad " instrument in the early 20th century . This " mandolin craze " was fading by the 1930s , but just as this practice was falling into disuse , the mandolin found a new niche in American country , old-time music , bluegrass and folk music . More recently , the Baroque and Classical mandolin repertory and styles have benefited from the raised awareness of and interest in Early music , with media attention to classical players such as Israeli Avi Avital , Italian Carlo Aonzo and American Joseph Brent .
Monroe 's style involved playing lead melodies in the style of a fiddler , and also a percussive chording sound referred to as " the chop " for the sound made by the quickly struck and muted strings . He also perfected a sparse , percussive blues style , especially up the neck in keys that had not been used much in country music , notably B and E. He emphasized a powerful , syncopated right hand at the expense of left-hand virtuosity . Monroe 's most influential follower of the second generation is Frank Wakefield and nowadays Mike Compton of the Nashville Bluegrass Band and David Long , who often tour as a duet . Tiny Moore of the Texas Playboys developed an electric five-string mandolin and helped popularize the instrument in Western Swing music .
Other major bluegrass mandolinists who emerged in the early 1950s and are still active include Jesse McReynolds ( of Jim and Jesse ) who invented a syncopated banjo-roll-like style called crosspicking—and Bobby Osborne of the Osborne Brothers , who is a master of clarity and sparkling single-note runs . Highly respected and influential modern bluegrass players include Herschel Sizemore , Doyle Lawson , and the multi-genre Sam Bush , who is equally at home with old-time fiddle tunes , rock , reggae , and jazz . Ronnie McCoury of the Del McCoury Band has won numerous awards for his Monroe-influenced playing . The late John Duffey of the original Country Gentlemen and later the Seldom Scene did much to popularize the bluegrass mandolin among folk and urban audiences , especially on the east coast and in the Washington , D.C. area .
Established acts benefited from the new commercial climate , with Whitesnake 's self-titled album ( 1987 ) selling over 17 million copies , outperforming anything in Coverdale 's or Deep Purple 's catalogue before or since . It featured the rock anthem " Here I Go Again '87 " as one of 4 UK top 20 singles . The follow-up Slip of the Tongue ( 1989 ) went platinum , but according to critics Steve Erlwine and Greg Prato , " it was a considerable disappointment after the across-the-board success of Whitesnake " . Aerosmith 's comeback album Permanent Vacation ( 1987 ) would begin a decade long revival of their popularity . Crazy Nights ( 1987 ) by Kiss was the band 's highest charting release in the US since 1979 and the highest of their career in the UK . Mötley Crüe with Girls , Girls , Girls ( 1987 ) continued their commercial success and Def Leppard with Hysteria ( 1987 ) hit their commercial peak , the latter producing seven hit singles ( a record for a hard rock act ) . Guns N ' Roses released the best-selling début of all time , Appetite for Destruction ( 1987 ) . With a " grittier " and " rawer " sound than most glam metal , it produced three top 10 hits , including the number one " Sweet Child O ' Mine " . Some of the glam rock bands that formed in the mid-1980s , such as White Lion and Cinderella experienced their biggest success during this period with their respective albums Pride ( 1987 ) and Long Cold Winter ( 1988 ) both going multi-platinum and launching a series of hit singles . In the last years of the decade , the most notable successes were New Jersey ( 1988 ) by Bon Jovi , OU812 ( 1988 ) by Van Halen , Open Up and Say ... Ahh ! ( 1988 ) by Poison , Pump ( 1989 ) by Aerosmith , and Mötley Crüe 's most commercially successful album Dr. Feelgood ( 1989 ) . New Jersey spawned five Top 10 singles , a record for a hard rock act . In 1988 from 25 June to 5 November , the number one spot on the Billboard 200 album chart was held by a hard rock album for 18 out of 20 consecutive weeks ; the albums were OU812 , Hysteria , Appetite for Destruction , and New Jersey . A final wave of glam rock bands arrived in the late 1980s , and experienced success with multi-platinum albums and hit singles from 1989 until the early 1990s , among them Extreme , Warrant Slaughter and FireHouse . Skid Row also released their eponymous début ( 1989 ) , reaching number six on the Billboard 200 , but they were to be one of the last major bands that emerged in the glam rock era .
In South Africa , the period of colonization resulted in many unions and marriages between European men and African women from various tribes , resulting in mixed-race children . As the Europeans acquired territory and imposed rule over the Africans , they generally pushed mixed-race and Africans into second-class status . During the first half of the 20th century , the Afrikaaner-dominated government classified the population according to four main racial groups : Black , White , Asian ( mostly Indian ) , and Coloured . The Coloured group included people of mixed Bantu , Khoisan , and European descent ( with some Malay ancestry , especially in the Western Cape ) . The Coloured definition occupied an intermediary political position between the Black and White definitions in South Africa . It imposed a system of legal racial segregation , a complex of laws known as apartheid .
On August 5 , 2008 , SCA and Bertelsmann announced that Sony had agreed to acquire Bertelsmann 's 50 % stake in Sony BMG . Sony completed its acquisition of Bertelsmann 's 50 % stake in the companies ' joint venture on October 1 , 2008 . The company , once again named Sony Music Entertainment Inc. , became a wholly owned subsidiary of Sony Corporation through its US subsidiary SCA . The last few albums to feature a Sony BMG logo were Thriller 25 by Michael Jackson , I Am ... Sasha Fierce by Beyoncé , Keeps Gettin ' Better : A Decade of Hits by Christina Aguilera , and Safe Trip Home by Dido . A temporary logo was unveiled beginning December 1 , 2008 . The present logo was unveiled in March 2009 .
Historians estimate that between the advent of Islam in 650CE and the abolition of slavery in the Arabian Peninsula in the mid-20th century , 10 to 18 million sub-Saharan Black Africans were enslaved by Arab slave traders and transported to the Arabian Peninsula and neighboring countries . This number far exceeded the number of slaves who were taken to the Americas . Several factors affected the visibility of descendants of this diaspora in 21st-century Arab societies : The traders shipped more female slaves than males , as there was a demand for them to serve as concubines in harems in the Arabian Peninsula and neighboring countries . Male slaves were castrated in order to serve as harem guards . The death toll of Black African slaves from forced labor was high . The mixed-race children of female slaves and Arab owners were assimilated into the Arab owners ' families under the patrilineal kinship system . As a result , few distinctive Afro-Arab black communities have survived in the Arabian Peninsula and neighboring countries .
The concept of blackness in the United States has been described as the degree to which one associates themselves with mainstream African-American culture , politics , and values . To a certain extent , this concept is not so much about race but more about political orientation , culture and behavior . Blackness can be contrasted with " acting white " , where black Americans are said to behave with assumed characteristics of stereotypical white Americans with regard to fashion , dialect , taste in music , and possibly , from the perspective of a significant number of black youth , academic achievement .
Antonio Vivaldi composed a mandolin concerto ( Concerto in C major Op.3 6 ) and two concertos for two mandolins and orchestra . Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart placed it in his 1787 work Don Giovanni and Beethoven created four variations of it . Antonio Maria Bononcini composed La conquista delle Spagne di Scipione Africano il giovane in 1707 and George Frideric Handel composed Alexander Balus in 1748 . Others include Giovani Battista Gervasio ( Sonata in D major for Mandolin and Basso Continuo ) , Giuseppe Giuliano ( Sonata in D major for Mandolin and Basso Continuo ) , Emanuele Barbella ( Sonata in D major for Mandolin and Basso Continuo ) , Domenico Scarlatti ( Sonata n.54 ( K.89 ) in D minor for Mandolin and Basso Continuo ) , and Addiego Guerra ( Sonata in G major for Mandolin and Basso Continuo ) .
In September 2015 , the 193 member states of the United Nations unanimously adopted the Sustainable Development Goals , a set of 17 goals aiming to transform the world over the next 15 years . These goals are designed to eliminate poverty , discrimination , abuse and preventable deaths , address environmental destruction , and usher in an era of development for all people , everywhere .
UNFPA works in partnership with governments , along with other United Nations agencies , communities , NGOs , foundations and the private sector , to raise awareness and mobilize the support and resources needed to achieve its mission to promote the rights and health of women and young people .
The US racial or ethnic classification " black " refers to people with all possible kinds of skin pigmentation , from the darkest through to the very lightest skin colors , including albinos , if they are believed by others to have West African ancestry ( in any discernible percentage ) , or to exhibit cultural traits associated with being " African American " . As a result , in the United States the term " black people " is not an indicator of skin color or ethnic origin but is instead a socially based racial classification related to being African American , with a family history associated with institutionalized slavery . Relatively dark-skinned people can be classified as white if they fulfill other social criteria of " whiteness " , and relatively light-skinned people can be classified as black if they fulfill the social criteria for " blackness " in a particular setting .
Since the 16th century , the city has had a bear pit , the Bärengraben , at the far end of the Nydeggbrücke to house its heraldic animals . The currently four bears are now kept in an open-air enclosure nearby , and two other young bears , a present by the Russian president , are kept in Dählhölzli zoo .
Book 1 ( at the head of the Odyssean section ) opens with a storm which Juno , Aeneas ' enemy throughout the poem , stirs up against the fleet . The storm drives the hero to the coast of Carthage , which historically was Rome 's deadliest foe . The queen , Dido , welcomes the ancestor of the Romans , and under the influence of the gods falls deeply in love with him . At a banquet in Book 2 , Aeneas tells the story of the sack of Troy , the death of his wife , and his escape , to the enthralled Carthaginians , while in Book 3 he recounts to them his wanderings over the Mediterranean in search of a suitable new home . Jupiter in Book 4 recalls the lingering Aeneas to his duty to found a new city , and he slips away from Carthage , leaving Dido to commit suicide , cursing Aeneas and calling down revenge in a symbolic anticipation of the fierce wars between Carthage and Rome . In Book 5 , Aeneas ' father Anchises dies and funeral games are celebrated for him . On reaching Cumae , in Italy in Book 6 , Aeneas consults the Cumaean Sibyl , who conducts him through the Underworld where Aeneas meets the dead Anchises who reveals Rome 's destiny to his son .
Luther had published his German translation of the New Testament in 1522 , and he and his collaborators completed the translation of the Old Testament in 1534 , when the whole Bible was published . He continued to work on refining the translation until the end of his life . Others had translated the Bible into German , but Luther tailored his translation to his own doctrine . When he was criticised for inserting the word " alone " after " faith " in Romans 3:28 , he replied in part : " [ T ] he text itself and the meaning of St. Paul urgently require and demand it . For in that very passage he is dealing with the main point of Christian doctrine , namely , that we are justified by faith in Christ without any works of the Law . ... But when works are so completely cut away – and that must mean that faith alone justifies – whoever would speak plainly and clearly about this cutting away of works will have to say , 'Faith alone justifies us , and not works ' . "
Being identified as either " black " or " white " in Australia during the 19th and early 20th centuries was critical in one 's employment and social prospects . Various state-based Aboriginal Protection Boards were established which had virtually complete control over the lives of Indigenous Australians – where they lived , their employment , marriage , education and included the power to separate children from their parents . Aborigines were not allowed to vote and were often confined to reserves and forced into low paid or effectively slave labour . The social position of mixed-race or " half-caste " individuals varied over time . A 1913 report by Sir Baldwin Spencer states that :
Luther secretly returned to Wittenberg on 6 March 1522 . He wrote to the Elector : " During my absence , Satan has entered my sheepfold , and committed ravages which I can not repair by writing , but only by my personal presence and living word . " For eight days in Lent , beginning on Invocavit Sunday , 9 March , Luther preached eight sermons , which became known as the " Invocavit Sermons " . In these sermons , he hammered home the primacy of core Christian values such as love , patience , charity , and freedom , and reminded the citizens to trust God 's word rather than violence to bring about necessary change .
Luther wrote " Aus tiefer Not schrei ich zu dir " ( " From depths of woe I cry to you " ) in 1523 as a hymnic version of Psalm 130 and sent it as a sample to encourage evangelical colleagues to write psalm-hymns for use in German worship . In a collaboration with Paul Speratus , this and seven other hymns were published in the Achtliederbuch , the first Lutheran hymnal . In 1524 Luther developed his original four-stanza psalm paraphrase into a five-stanza Reformation hymn that developed the theme of " grace alone " more fully . Because it expressed essential Reformation doctrine , this expanded version of " Aus tiefer Not " was designated as a regular component of several regional Lutheran liturgies and was widely used at funerals , including Luther 's own . Along with Erhart Hegenwalt 's hymnic version of Psalm 51 , Luther 's expanded hymn was also adopted for use with the fifth part of Luther 's catechism , concerning confession .
Luther sympathised with some of the peasants ' grievances , as he showed in his response to the Twelve Articles in May 1525 , but he reminded the aggrieved to obey the temporal authorities . During a tour of Thuringia , he became enraged at the widespread burning of convents , monasteries , bishops ' palaces , and libraries . In Against the Murderous , Thieving Hordes of Peasants , written on his return to Wittenberg , he gave his interpretation of the Gospel teaching on wealth , condemned the violence as the devil 's work , and called for the nobles to put down the rebels like mad dogs :
The plan stated that the following numbers of species of different groups had been recorded from Egypt : algae ( 1483 species ) , animals ( about 15,000 species of which more than 10,000 were insects ) , fungi ( more than 627 species ) , monera ( 319 species ) , plants ( 2426 species ) , protozoans ( 371 species ) . For some major groups , for example lichen-forming fungi and nematode worms , the number was not known . Apart from small and well-studied groups like amphibians , birds , fish , mammals and reptiles , the many of those numbers are likely to increase as further species are recorded from Egypt . For the fungi , including lichen-forming species , for example , subsequent work has shown that over 2200 species have been recorded from Egypt , and the final figure of all fungi actually occurring in the country is expected to be much higher .
These patterns of discrimination against non-whites have led some academic and other activists to advocate for use of the Portuguese term negro to encompass all African-descended people , in order to stimulate a " black " consciousness and identity . This proposal has been criticized since the term pardo is considered to include a wide range of multiracial people , such as caboclos ( mestizos ) , assimilated Amerindians and tri-racials , not only people of partial African and European descent . Trying to identify this entire group as " black " would be a false imposition of a different identity from outside the culture and deny people their other , equally valid , ancestries and cultures . It seems a one-drop rule in reverse .
Since 1962 , the cardinal bishops have only a titular relationship with the suburbicarian sees , with no powers of governance over them . Each see has its own bishop , with the exception of Ostia , in which the Cardinal Vicar of the see of Rome is apostolic administrator .
Luther refused to recant his writings . He is sometimes also quoted as saying : " Here I stand . I can do no other " . Recent scholars consider the evidence for these words to be unreliable , since they were inserted before " May God help me " only in later versions of the speech and not recorded in witness accounts of the proceedings . However , Mullett suggests that given his nature , " we are free to believe that Luther would tend to select the more dramatic form of words . "
The Rose Garden ( Rosengarten ) , from which a scenic panoramic view of the medieval town centre can be enjoyed , is a well-kept Rosarium on a hill , converted into a park from a former cemetery in 1913 .
With 4:51 left in regulation , Carolina got the ball on their own 24-yard line with a chance to mount a game-winning drive , and soon faced 3rd-and-9 . On the next play , Miller stripped the ball away from Newton , and after several players dove for it , it took a long bounce backwards and was recovered by Ward , who returned it five yards to the Panthers 4-yard line . Although several players dove into the pile to attempt to recover it , Newton did not and his lack of aggression later earned him heavy criticism . Meanwhile , Denver 's offense was kept out of the end zone for three plays , but a holding penalty on cornerback Josh Norman gave the Broncos a new set of downs . Then Anderson scored on a 2-yard touchdown run and Manning completed a pass to Bennie Fowler for a 2-point conversion , giving Denver a 24–10 lead with 3:08 left and essentially putting the game away . Carolina had two more drives , but failed to get a first down on each one .
Approximately 12 million Africans were shipped to the Americas during the Atlantic slave trade from 1492 to 1888 , with 11.5 million of those shipped to South America and the Caribbean . Brazil was the largest importer in the Americas , with 5.5 million African slaves imported , followed by the British Caribbean with 2.76 million , the Spanish Caribbean and Spanish Mainland with 1.59 million Africans , and the French Caribbean with 1.32 million . Today their descendants number approximately 150 million in South America and the Caribbean . In addition to skin color , other physical characteristics such as facial features and hair texture are often variously used in classifying peoples as black in South America and the Caribbean . In South America and the Caribbean , classification as black is also closely tied to social status and socioeconomic variables , especially in light of social conceptions of " blanqueamiento " ( racial whitening ) and related concepts .
At the time of the Marburg Colloquy , Suleiman the Magnificent was besieging Vienna with a vast Ottoman army . Luther had argued against resisting the Turks in his 1518 Explanation of the Ninety-five Theses , provoking accusations of defeatism . He saw the Turks as a scourge sent to punish Christians by God , as agents of the Biblical apocalypse that would destroy the antichrist , whom Luther believed to be the papacy , and the Roman Church . He consistently rejected the idea of a Holy War , " as though our people were an army of Christians against the Turks , who were enemies of Christ . This is absolutely contrary to Christ 's doctrine and name " . On the other hand , in keeping with his doctrine of the two kingdoms , Luther did support non-religious war against the Turks . In 1526 , he argued in Whether Soldiers can be in a State of Grace that national defence is reason for a just war . By 1529 , in On War against the Turk , he was actively urging Emperor Charles V and the German people to fight a secular war against the Turks . He made clear , however , that the spiritual war against an alien faith was separate , to be waged through prayer and repentance . Around the time of the Siege of Vienna , Luther wrote a prayer for national deliverance from the Turks , asking God to " give to our emperor perpetual victory over our enemies " .
The negotiations were successfully concluded on 17 February 1546 . After 8 a.m. , he experienced chest pains . When he went to his bed , he prayed , " Into your hand I commit my spirit ; you have redeemed me , O Lord , faithful God " ( Ps . 31:5 ) , the common prayer of the dying . At 1 a.m. he awoke with more chest pain and was warmed with hot towels . He thanked God for revealing his Son to him in whom he had believed . His companions , Justus Jonas and Michael Coelius , shouted loudly , " Reverend father , are you ready to die trusting in your Lord Jesus Christ and to confess the doctrine which you have taught in his name ? " A distinct " Yes " was Luther 's reply .
Luther 's rediscovery of " Christ and His salvation " was the first of two points that became the foundation for the Reformation . His railing against the sale of indulgences was based on it .
In 525 BC , the powerful Achaemenid Persians , led by Cambyses II , began their conquest of Egypt , eventually capturing the pharaoh Psamtik III at the battle of Pelusium . Cambyses II then assumed the formal title of pharaoh , but ruled Egypt from his home of Susa in Persia ( modern Iran ) , leaving Egypt under the control of a satrapy . The entire Twenty-seventh Dynasty of Egypt , from 525 BC to 402 BC , save for Petubastis III , was an entirely Persian ruled period , with the Achaemenid kings all being granted the title of pharaoh . A few temporarily successful revolts against the Persians marked the fifth century BC , but Egypt was never able to permanently overthrow the Persians .
The official language of the Republic is Modern Standard Arabic . Arabic was adopted by the Egyptians after the Arab invasion of Egypt . The spoken languages are : Egyptian Arabic ( 68 % ) , Sa'idi Arabic ( 29 % ) , Eastern Egyptian Bedawi Arabic ( 1.6 % ) , Sudanese Arabic ( 0.6 % ) , Domari ( 0.3 % ) , Nobiin ( 0.3 % ) , Beja ( 0.1 % ) , Siwi and others . Additionally , Greek , Armenian and Italian are the main languages of immigrants . In Alexandria in the 19th century there was a large community of Italian Egyptians and Italian was the " lingua franca " of the city .
The Broncos defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers in the divisional round , 23–16 , by scoring 11 points in the final three minutes of the game . They then beat the defending Super Bowl XLIX champion New England Patriots in the AFC Championship Game , 20–18 , by intercepting a pass on New England 's 2-point conversion attempt with 17 seconds left on the clock . Despite Manning 's problems with interceptions during the season , he did n't throw any in their two playoff games .
Most of the population ( as of 2000 [ update ] ) speaks German ( 104,465 or 81.2 % ) as their first language , Italian is the second most common ( 5,062 or 3.9 % ) and French is the third ( 4,671 or 3.6 % ) . There are 171 people who speak Romansh .
Super Bowl 50 featured numerous records from individuals and teams . Denver won despite being massively outgained in total yards ( 315 to 194 ) and first downs ( 21 to 11 ) . Their 194 yards and 11 first downs were both the lowest totals ever by a Super Bowl winning team . The previous record was 244 yards by the Baltimore Ravens in Super Bowl XXXV . Only seven other teams had ever gained less than 200 yards in a Super Bowl , and all of them had lost . The Broncos ' seven sacks tied a Super Bowl record set by the Chicago Bears in Super Bowl XX . Kony Ealy tied a Super Bowl record with three sacks . Jordan Norwood 's 61-yard punt return set a new record , surpassing the old record of 45 yards set by John Taylor in Super Bowl XXIII . Denver was just 1-of-14 on third down , while Carolina was barely better at 3-of-15 . The two teams ' combined third down conversion percentage of 13.8 was a Super Bowl low . Manning and Newton had quarterback passer ratings of 56.6 and 55.4 , respectively , and their added total of 112 is a record lowest aggregate passer rating for a Super Bowl . Manning became the oldest quarterback ever to win a Super Bowl at age 39 , and the first quarterback ever to win a Super Bowl with two different teams , while Gary Kubiak became the first head coach to win a Super Bowl with the same franchise he went to the Super Bowl with as a player .
In 1523 , Luther wrote that Jesus Christ was born a Jew which discouraged mistreatment of the Jews and advocated their conversion by proving that the Old Testament could be shown to speak of Jesus Christ . However , as the Reformation continued , Luther began to lose hope in large-scale Jewish conversion to Christianity . In his later years , Luther grew more hostile toward the Jews , writing against them with the kind of venom he had already unleashed on the Anabaptists , Zwinglianism , and the papacy . His 1543 treatise Von den Juden und ihren Lügen ( On the Jews and Their Lies ) took its place among other anti-Jewish literature of the times , although historians acknowledge that this treatise was particularly extreme , even by the standards of sixteenth century Europe . In it , he takes a hardline against Judaism , writing that synagogues and Jewish homes should be destroyed , their money confiscated , and liberty curtailed . These statements and their influence on antisemitism have contributed to his controversial status .

This extends to the Personal video recorder ( PVR ) offering ( branded Sky+ ) .
American University economist George Ayittey accused the Arab government of Sudan of practicing acts of racism against black citizens . According to Ayittey , " In Sudan ... the Arabs monopolized power and excluded blacks – Arab apartheid . " Many African commentators joined Ayittey in accusing Sudan of practising Arab apartheid .
Foreign direct investment ( FDI ) in Egypt increased considerably before the removal of Hosni Mubarak , exceeding $ 6 billion in 2006 , due to economic liberalisation and privatisation measures taken by minister of investment Mahmoud Mohieddin . [ citation needed ] Since the fall of Hosni Mubarak in 2011 , Egypt has experienced a drastic fall in both foreign investment and tourism revenues , followed by a 60 % drop in foreign exchange reserves , a 3 % drop in growth , and a rapid devaluation of the Egyptian pound .
As of 2000 [ update ] , there were 67,115 private households in the municipality , and an average of 1.8 persons per household . There were 34,981 households that consist of only one person and 1,592 households with five or more people . In 2000 [ update ] , a total of 65,538 apartments ( 90.6 % of the total ) were permanently occupied , while 5,352 apartments ( 7.4 % ) were seasonally occupied and 1,444 apartments ( 2.0 % ) were empty . As of 2009 [ update ] , the construction rate of new housing units was 1.2 new units per 1000 residents .
On June 4 , 2014 , the NFL announced that the practice of branding Super Bowl games with Roman numerals , a practice established at Super Bowl V , would be temporarily suspended , and that the game would be named using Arabic numerals as Super Bowl 50 as opposed to Super Bowl L. The use of Roman numerals will be reinstated for Super Bowl LI . Jaime Weston , the league 's vice president of brand and creative , explained that a primary reason for the change was the difficulty of designing an aesthetically pleasing logo with the letter " L " using the standardized logo template introduced at Super Bowl XLV . The logo also deviates from the template by featuring large numerals , colored in gold , behind the Vince Lombardi Trophy , instead of underneath and in silver as in the standard logo .

Luther was the most widely read author of his generation , and within Germany he acquired the status of a prophet . According to the prevailing view among historians , his anti-Jewish rhetoric contributed significantly to the development of antisemitism in Germany , and in the 1930s and 1940s provided an " ideal underpinning " for the Nazis ' attacks on Jews . Reinhold Lewin writes that anybody who " wrote against the Jews for whatever reason believed he had the right to justify himself by triumphantly referring to Luther . " According to Michael , just about every anti-Jewish book printed in the Third Reich contained references to and quotations from Luther . Heinrich Himmler wrote admiringly of his writings and sermons on the Jews in 1940 . The city of Nuremberg presented a first edition of On the Jews and their Lies to Julius Streicher , editor of the Nazi newspaper Der Stürmer , on his birthday in 1937 ; the newspaper described it as the most radically anti-Semitic tract ever published . It was publicly exhibited in a glass case at the Nuremberg rallies and quoted in a 54-page explanation of the Aryan Law by Dr. E.H. Schulz and Dr. R. Frercks .
In July 2013 , the English High Court of Justice found that Microsoft ’ s use of the term " SkyDrive " infringed on Sky ’ s right to the " Sky " trademark . On 31 July 2013 , BSkyB and Microsoft announced their settlement , in which Microsoft will not appeal the ruling , and will rename its SkyDrive cloud storage service after an unspecified " reasonable period of time to allow for an orderly transition to a new brand , " plus " financial and other terms , the details of which are confidential " . On 27 January 2014 , Microsoft announced " that SkyDrive will soon become OneDrive " and " SkyDrive Pro " becomes " OneDrive for Business " .

On the other hand , Luther also points out that the Ten Commandments – when considered not as God 's condemning judgment but as an expression of his eternal will , that is , of the natural law – also positively teach how the Christian ought to live . This has traditionally been called the " third use of the law . " For Luther , also Christ 's life , when understood as an example , is nothing more than an illustration of the Ten Commandments , which a Christian should follow in his or her vocations on a daily basis .
Luther 's final journey , to Mansfeld , was taken because of his concern for his siblings ' families continuing in their father Hans Luther 's copper mining trade . Their livelihood was threatened by Count Albrecht of Mansfeld bringing the industry under his own control . The controversy that ensued involved all four Mansfeld counts : Albrecht , Philip , John George , and Gerhard . Luther journeyed to Mansfeld twice in late 1545 to participate in the negotiations for a settlement , and a third visit was needed in early 1546 for their completion .
As of 2008 [ update ] , the population was 47.5 % male and 52.5 % female . The population was made up of 44,032 Swiss men ( 35.4 % of the population ) and 15,092 ( 12.1 % ) non-Swiss men . There were 51,531 Swiss women ( 41.4 % ) and 13,726 ( 11.0 % ) non-Swiss women . Of the population in the municipality , 39,008 or about 30.3 % were born in Bern and lived there in 2000 . There were 27,573 or 21.4 % who were born in the same canton , while 25,818 or 20.1 % were born somewhere else in Switzerland , and 27,812 or 21.6 % were born outside of Switzerland .
Luther 's Small Catechism proved especially effective in helping parents teach their children ; likewise the Larger Catechism was effective for pastors . Using the German vernacular , they expressed the Apostles ' Creed in simpler , more personal , Trinitarian language . He rewrote each article of the Creed to express the character of the Father , the Son , or the Holy Spirit . Luther 's goal was to enable the catechumens to see themselves as a personal object of the work of the three persons of the Trinity , each of which works in the catechumen 's life . That is , Luther depicted the Trinity not as a doctrine to be learned , but as persons to be known . The Father creates , the Son redeems , and the Spirit sanctifies , a divine unity with separate personalities . Salvation originates with the Father and draws the believer to the Father . Luther 's treatment of the Apostles ' Creed must be understood in the context of the Decalogue ( the Ten Commandments ) and the Lord 's Prayer , which are also part of the Lutheran catechical teaching .

According to Ayittey , " In Sudan ... the Arabs monopolized power and excluded blacks – Arab apartheid . " Many African commentators joined Ayittey in accusing Sudan of practising Arab apartheid .
By 1526 , Luther found himself increasingly occupied in organising a new church . His Biblical ideal of congregations ' choosing their own ministers had proved unworkable . According to Bainton : " Luther 's dilemma was that he wanted both a confessional church based on personal faith and experience and a territorial church including all in a given locality . If he were forced to choose , he would take his stand with the masses , and this was the direction in which he moved . " From 1525 to 1529 , he established a supervisory church body , laid down a new form of worship service , and wrote a clear summary of the new faith in the form of two catechisms . Luther 's thought is revolutionary to the extent that it is a theology of the cross , the negation of every affirmation : as long as the cross is at the center , the system building tendency of reason is held in check , and system building does not degenerate into System .
In 1983 the historic old town in the centre of Bern became a UNESCO World Heritage Site . Bern is ranked among the world ’ s top ten cities for the best quality of life ( 2010 ) .
Isidore of Seville , writing in the 7th century , claimed that the Latin word Maurus was derived from the Greek mauron , μαύρον , which is the Greek word for black . Indeed , by the time Isidore of Seville came to write his Etymologies , the word Maurus or " Moor " had become an adjective in Latin , " for the Greeks call black , mauron " . " In Isidore ’ s day , Moors were black by definition… "
The theologians , including Zwingli , Melanchthon , Martin Bucer , and Johannes Oecolampadius , differed on the significance of the words spoken by Jesus at the Last Supper : " This is my body which is for you " and " This cup is the new covenant in my blood " ( 1 Corinthians 11:23–26 ) . Luther insisted on the Real Presence of the body and blood of Christ in the consecrated bread and wine , which he called the sacramental union , while his opponents believed God to be only spiritually or symbolically present . Zwingli , for example , denied Jesus ' ability to be in more than one place at a time but Luther stressed the omnipresence of his human nature . According to transcripts , the debate sometimes became confrontational . Citing Jesus ' words " The flesh profiteth nothing " ( John 6.63 ) , Zwingli said , " This passage breaks your neck " . " Do n't be too proud , " Luther retorted , " German necks do n't break that easily . This is Hesse , not Switzerland . " On his table Luther wrote the words " Hoc est corpus meum " ( " This is my body " ) in chalk , to continually indicate his firm stance .
Egypt has a wide range of beaches situated on the Mediterranean and the Red Sea that extend to over 3,000 km . The Red Sea has serene waters , coloured coral reefs , rare fish and beautiful mountains . The Akba Gulf beaches also provide facilities for practising sea sports . Safaga tops the Red Sea zone with its beautiful location on the Suez Gulf . Last but not least , Sharm el-Sheikh ( or City of Peace ) , Hurghada , Luxor ( known as world 's greatest open-air museum/ or City of the ⅓ of world monuments ) , Dahab , Ras Sidr , Marsa Alam , Safaga and the northern coast of the Mediterranean are major tourist 's destinations of the recreational tourism .

Hard rock developed into a major form of popular music in the 1970s , with bands such as Led Zeppelin , The Who , Deep Purple , Aerosmith , AC/DC and Van Halen . During the 1980s , some hard rock bands moved away from their hard rock roots and more towards pop rock , while others began to return to a hard rock sound . Established bands made a comeback in the mid-1980s and it reached a commercial peak in the 1980s , with glam metal bands like Bon Jovi and Def Leppard and the rawer sounds of Guns N ' Roses , which followed up with great success in the later part of that decade . Hard rock began losing popularity with the commercial success of grunge and later Britpop in the 1990s .
Critics of the Aeneid focus on a variety of issues . The tone of the poem as a whole is a particular matter of debate ; some see the poem as ultimately pessimistic and politically subversive to the Augustan regime , while others view it as a celebration of the new imperial dynasty . Virgil makes use of the symbolism of the Augustan regime , and some scholars see strong associations between Augustus and Aeneas , the one as founder and the other as re-founder of Rome . A strong teleology , or drive towards a climax , has been detected in the poem . The Aeneid is full of prophecies about the future of Rome , the deeds of Augustus , his ancestors , and famous Romans , and the Carthaginian Wars ; the shield of Aeneas even depicts Augustus ' victory at Actium against Mark Antony and Cleopatra VII in 31 BC . A further focus of study is the character of Aeneas . As the protagonist of the poem , Aeneas seems to waver constantly between his emotions and commitment to his prophetic duty to found Rome ; critics note the breakdown of Aeneas ' emotional control in the last sections of the poem where the " pious " and " righteous " Aeneas mercilessly slaughters Turnus .
The New Kingdom c. 1550–1070 BC began with the Eighteenth Dynasty , marking the rise of Egypt as an international power that expanded during its greatest extension to an empire as far south as Tombos in Nubia , and included parts of the Levant in the east . This period is noted for some of the most well known Pharaohs , including Hatshepsut , Thutmose III , Akhenaten and his wife Nefertiti , Tutankhamun and Ramesses II . The first historically attested expression of monotheism came during this period as Atenism . Frequent contacts with other nations brought new ideas to the New Kingdom . The country was later invaded and conquered by Libyans , Nubians and Assyrians , but native Egyptians eventually drove them out and regained control of their country .
In 1501 , at the age of 19 , he entered the University of Erfurt , which he later described as a beerhouse and whorehouse . He was made to wake at four every morning for what has been described as " a day of rote learning and often wearying spiritual exercises . " He received his master 's degree in 1505 .
On Carolina 's next possession fullback Mike Tolbert lost a fumble while being tackled by safety Darian Stewart , which linebacker Danny Trevathan recovered on the Broncos 40-yard line . However , the Panthers soon took the ball back when defensive end Kony Ealy tipped a Manning pass to himself and then intercepted it , returning the ball 19 yards to the Panthers 39-yard line with 1:55 left on the clock . The Panthers could not gain any yards with their possession and had to punt . After a Denver punt , Carolina drove to the Broncos 45-yard line . But with 11 seconds left , Newton was sacked by DeMarcus Ware as time expired in the half .
At Maecenas ' insistence ( according to the tradition ) Virgil spent the ensuing years ( perhaps 37–29 BC ) on the long didactic hexameter poem called the Georgics ( from Greek , " On Working the Earth " ) which he dedicated to Maecenas . The ostensible theme of the Georgics is instruction in the methods of running a farm . In handling this theme , Virgil follows in the didactic ( " how to " ) tradition of the Greek poet Hesiod 's Works and Days and several works of the later Hellenistic poets . The four books of the Georgics focus respectively on raising crops and trees ( 1 and 2 ) , livestock and horses ( 3 ) , and beekeeping and the qualities of bees ( 4 ) . Well-known passages include the beloved Laus Italiae of Book 2 , the prologue description of the temple in Book 3 , and the description of the plague at the end of Book 3 . Book 4 concludes with a long mythological narrative , in the form of an epyllion which describes vividly the discovery of beekeeping by Aristaeus and the story of Orpheus ' journey to the underworld . Ancient scholars , such as Servius , conjectured that the Aristaeus episode replaced , at the emperor 's request , a long section in praise of Virgil 's friend , the poet Gallus , who was disgraced by Augustus , and who committed suicide in 26 BC .
The permanent headquarters of the Arab League are located in Cairo and the body 's secretary general has traditionally been Egyptian . This position is currently held by former foreign minister Nabil el-Araby . The Arab League briefly moved from Egypt to Tunis in 1978 to protest the Egypt-Israel Peace Treaty , but it later returned to Cairo in 1989 . Gulf monarchies , including the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia , have pledged billions of dollars to help Egypt overcome its economic difficulties since the July 2013 coup .
The Panthers used the San Jose State practice facility and stayed at the San Jose Marriott . The Broncos practiced at Stanford University and stayed at the Santa Clara Marriott .
Often categorised with the New Wave of British Heavy Metal , in 1981 Def Leppard released their second album High 'n ' Dry , mixing glam-rock with heavy metal , and helping to define the sound of hard rock for the decade . The follow-up Pyromania ( 1983 ) , reached number two on the American charts and the singles " Photograph " , " Rock of Ages " and " Foolin ' " , helped by the emergence of MTV , all reached the Top 40 . It was widely emulated , particularly by the emerging Californian glam metal scene . This was followed by US acts like Mötley Crüe , with their albums Too Fast for Love ( 1981 ) and Shout at the Devil ( 1983 ) and , as the style grew , the arrival of bands such as Ratt , White Lion , Twisted Sister and Quiet Riot . Quiet Riot 's album Metal Health ( 1983 ) was the first glam metal album , and arguably the first heavy metal album of any kind , to reach number one in the Billboard music charts and helped open the doors for mainstream success by subsequent bands .
Political and economic relations were drastically influenced by these theories as the concept of the guild was subordinated to the theory of free trade , and Roman Catholic dominance of theology was increasingly challenged by Protestant churches subordinate to each nation-state , which also ( in a fashion the Roman Catholic Church often decried angrily ) preached in the vulgar or native language of each region . However , the enlightenment was an outright attack on religion , particularly Christianity . The most outspoken critic of the church in France was François Marie Arouet de Voltaire , a representative figure of the enlightenment . After Voltaire , religion would never be the same again in France .
Boundaries can be inclusive or exclusive depending on how they are perceived by other people . An exclusive boundary arises , for example , when a person adopts a marker that imposes restrictions on the behaviour of others . An inclusive boundary is created , by contrast , by the use of a marker with which other people are ready and able to associate . At the same time , however , an inclusive boundary will also impose restrictions on the people it has included by limiting their inclusion within other boundaries . An example of this is the use of a particular language by a newcomer in a room full of people speaking various languages . Some people may understand the language used by this person while others may not . Those who do not understand it might take the newcomer 's use of this particular language merely as a neutral sign of identity . But they might also perceive it as imposing an exclusive boundary that is meant to mark them off from her . On the other hand , those who do understand the newcomer 's language could take it as an inclusive boundary , through which the newcomer associates herself with them to the exclusion of the other people present . Equally , however , it is possible that people who do understand the newcomer but who also speak another language may not want to speak the newcomer 's language and so see her marker as an imposition and a negative boundary . It is possible that the newcomer is either aware or unaware of this , depending on whether she herself knows other languages or is conscious of the plurilingual quality of the people there and is respectful of it or not .
In 1970 , President Nasser died and was succeeded by Anwar Sadat . Sadat switched Egypt 's Cold War allegiance from the Soviet Union to the United States , expelling Soviet advisors in 1972 . He launched the Infitah economic reform policy , while clamping down on religious and secular opposition . In 1973 , Egypt , along with Syria , launched the October War , a surprise attack to regain part of the Sinai territory Israel had captured 6 years earlier . it presented Sadat with a victory that allowed him to regain the Sinai later in return for peace with Israel .

The definition makes no declaration about the Church 's belief that the Blessed Virgin was sinless in the sense of freedom from actual or personal sin . However , the Church holds that Mary was also sinless personally , " free from all sin , original or personal " . The Council of Trent decreed : " If anyone shall say that a man once justified can sin no more , nor lose grace , and that therefore he who falls and sins was never truly justified ; or , on the contrary , that throughout his whole life he can avoid all sins even venial sins , except by a special privilege of God , as the Church holds in regard to the Blessed Virgin : let him be anathema . "
In honor of the 50th Super Bowl , the pregame ceremony featured the on-field introduction of 39 of the 43 previous Super Bowl Most Valuable Players . Bart Starr ( MVP of Super Bowls I and II ) and Chuck Howley ( MVP of Super Bowl V ) appeared via video , while Peyton Manning ( MVP of Super Bowl XLI and current Broncos quarterback ) was shown in the locker room preparing for the game . No plans were announced regarding the recognition of Harvey Martin , co-MVP of Super Bowl XII , who died in 2001 .
By the 2000 census , demographic changes including the end to slavery , immigration from Europe and Asia , assimilation of multiracial persons , and other factors resulted in a population in which 6.2 % of the population identified as black , 40 % as pardo , and 55 % as white . Essentially most of the black population was absorbed into the multi-racial category by intermixing . A 2007 genetic study found that at least 29 % of the middle-class , white Brazilian population had some recent ( since 1822 and the end of the colonial period ) African ancestry .
Westwood One will carry the game throughout North America , with Kevin Harlan as play-by-play announcer , Boomer Esiason and Dan Fouts as color analysts , and James Lofton and Mark Malone as sideline reporters . Jim Gray will anchor the pre-game and halftime coverage .
Martin Luther married Katharina von Bora , one of 12 nuns he had helped escape from the Nimbschen Cistercian convent in April 1523 , when he arranged for them to be smuggled out in herring barrels . " Suddenly , and while I was occupied with far different thoughts , " he wrote to Wenceslaus Link , " the Lord has plunged me into marriage . " At the time of their marriage , Katharina was 26 years old and Luther was 41 years old .
Other than by appearance , " Coloureds " can usually be distinguished from " Blacks " by language . Most speak Afrikaans or English as a first language , as opposed to Bantu languages such as Zulu or Xhosa . They also tend to have more European-sounding names than Bantu names .
In Latin , on the other hand , the [ First name ] Cardinal [ Surname ] order is used in the proclamation of the election of a new pope by the cardinal protodeacon : " Annuntio vobis gaudium magnum ; habemus Papam : Eminentissimum ac Reverendissimum Dominum , Dominum ( first name ) Sanctae Romanae Ecclesiae Cardinalem ( last name ) , ... " ( Meaning : " I announce to you a great joy ; we have a Pope : The Most Eminent and Most Reverend Lord , Lord ( first name ) Cardinal of the Holy Roman Church ( last name ) , ... " ) This assumes that the new pope had been a cardinal just before becoming pope ; the most recent election of a non-cardinal as pope was in 1378 .
In South Africa , the period of colonization resulted in many unions and marriages between European men and African women from various tribes , resulting in mixed-race children . As the Europeans acquired territory and imposed rule over the Africans , they generally pushed mixed-race and Africans into second-class status . During the first half of the 20th century , the Afrikaaner-dominated government classified the population according to four main racial groups : Black , White , Asian ( mostly Indian ) , and Coloured . The Coloured group included people of mixed Bantu , Khoisan , and European descent ( with some Malay ancestry , especially in the Western Cape ) . The Coloured definition occupied an intermediary political position between the Black and White definitions in South Africa . It imposed a system of legal racial segregation , a complex of laws known as apartheid .
Luther had published his German translation of the New Testament in 1522 , and he and his collaborators completed the translation of the Old Testament in 1534 , when the whole Bible was published . He continued to work on refining the translation until the end of his life . Others had translated the Bible into German , but Luther tailored his translation to his own doctrine . When he was criticised for inserting the word " alone " after " faith " in Romans 3:28 , he replied in part : " [ T ] he text itself and the meaning of St. Paul urgently require and demand it . For in that very passage he is dealing with the main point of Christian doctrine , namely , that we are justified by faith in Christ without any works of the Law . ... But when works are so completely cut away – and that must mean that faith alone justifies – whoever would speak plainly and clearly about this cutting away of works will have to say , 'Faith alone justifies us , and not works ' . "
In 1989 , CBS Records re-entered the music publishing business by acquiring Nashville music publisher Tree International Publishing for more than $ 30 million .
In 1630 , Pope Urban VIII decreed their title to be Eminence ( previously , it had been " illustrissimo " and " reverendissimo " ) and decreed that their secular rank would equate to Prince , making them secondary only to the Pope and crowned monarchs .
The mandolin has been used extensively in the traditional music of England and Scotland for generations . Simon Mayor is a prominent British player who has produced six solo albums , instructional books and DVDs , as well as recordings with his mandolin quartet the Mandolinquents . The instrument has also found its way into British rock music . The mandolin was played by Mike Oldfield ( and introduced by Vivian Stanshall ) on Oldfield 's album Tubular Bells , as well as on a number of his subsequent albums ( particularly prominently on Hergest Ridge ( 1974 ) and Ommadawn ( 1975 ) ) . It was used extensively by the British folk-rock band Lindisfarne , who featured two members on the instrument , Ray Jackson and Simon Cowe , and whose " Fog on the Tyne " was the biggest selling UK album of 1971-1972 . The instrument was also used extensively in the UK folk revival of the 1960s and 1970s with bands such as Fairport Convention and Steeleye Span taking it on as the lead instrument in many of their songs . Maggie May by Rod Stewart , which hit No . 1 on both the British charts and the Billboard Hot 100 , also featured Jackson 's playing . It has also been used by other British rock musicians . Led Zeppelin 's bassist John Paul Jones is an accomplished mandolin player and has recorded numerous songs on mandolin including Going to California and That 's the Way ; the mandolin part on The Battle of Evermore is played by Jimmy Page , who composed the song . Other Led Zeppelin songs featuring mandolin are Hey Hey What Can I Do , and Black Country Woman . Pete Townshend of The Who played mandolin on the track Mike Post Theme , along with many other tracks on Endless Wire . McGuinness Flint , for whom Graham Lyle played the mandolin on their most successful single , When I 'm Dead And Gone , is another example . Lyle was also briefly a member of Ronnie Lane 's Slim Chance , and played mandolin on their hit How Come . One of the more prominent early mandolin players in popular music was Robin Williamson in The Incredible String Band . Ian Anderson of Jethro Tull is a highly accomplished mandolin player ( beautiful track Pussy Willow ) , as is his guitarist Martin Barre . The popular song Please Please Please Let Me Get What I Want by The Smiths featured a mandolin solo played by Johnny Marr . More recently , the Glasgow-based band Sons and Daughters featured the mandolin , played by Ailidh Lennon , on tracks such as Fight , Start to End , and Medicine . British folk-punk icons the Levellers also regularly use the mandolin in their songs . Current bands are also beginning to use the Mandolin and its unique sound - such as South London 's Indigo Moss who use it throughout their recordings and live gigs . The mandolin has also featured in the playing of Matthew Bellamy in the rock band Muse . It also forms the basis of Paul McCartney 's 2007 hit " Dance Tonight . " That was not the first time a Beatle played a mandolin , however ; that distinction goes to George Harrison on Gone Troppo , the title cut from the 1982 album of the same name . The mandolin is taught in Lanarkshire by the Lanarkshire Guitar and Mandolin Association to over 100 people . Also more recently hard rock supergroup Them Crooked Vultures have been playing a song based primarily using a mandolin . This song was left off their debut album , and features former Led Zeppelin bassist John Paul Jones . [ citation needed ]

With the rise of disco in the US and punk rock in the UK , hard rock 's mainstream dominance was rivalled toward the later part of the decade . Disco appealed to a more diverse group of people and punk seemed to take over the rebellious role that hard rock once held . Early punk bands like The Ramones explicitly rebelled against the drum solos and extended guitar solos that characterised stadium rock , with almost all of their songs clocking in around two minutes with no guitar solos . However , new rock acts continued to emerge and record sales remained high into the 1980s . 1977 saw the début and rise to stardom of Foreigner , who went on to release several platinum albums through to the mid-1980s . Midwestern groups like Kansas , REO Speedwagon and Styx helped further cement heavy rock in the Midwest as a form of stadium rock . In 1978 , Van Halen emerged from the Los Angeles music scene with a sound based around the skills of lead guitarist Eddie Van Halen . He popularised a guitar-playing technique of two-handed hammer-ons and pull-offs called tapping , showcased on the song " Eruption " from the album Van Halen , which was highly influential in re-establishing hard rock as a popular genre after the punk and disco explosion , while also redefining and elevating the role of electric guitar .
The tradition holds that Virgil was born in the village of Andes , near Mantua in Cisalpine Gaul . Analysis of his name has led to beliefs that he descended from earlier Roman colonists . Modern speculation ultimately is not supported by narrative evidence either from his own writings or his later biographers . Macrobius says that Virgil 's father was of a humble background ; however , scholars generally believe that Virgil was from an equestrian landowning family which could afford to give him an education . He attended schools in Cremona , Mediolanum , Rome and Naples . After considering briefly a career in rhetoric and law , the young Virgil turned his talents to poetry .
The inclusiveness of Weinreich 's definition ( above ) directs attention to the totality of one 's identity at a given phase in time , and assists in elucidating component aspects of one 's total identity , such as one 's gender identity , ethnic identity , occupational identity and so on . The definition readily applies to the young child , to the adolescent , to the young adult , and to the older adult in various phases of the life cycle . Depending on whether one is a young child or an adult at the height of one 's powers , how one construes oneself as one was in the past will refer to very different salient experiential markers . Likewise , how one construes oneself as one aspires to be in the future will differ considerably according to one 's age and accumulated experiences . ( Weinreich & Saunderson , ( eds ) 2003 , pp 26–34 ) .
The Aeneid is widely considered Virgil 's finest work and one of the most important poems in the history of western literature . Virgil worked on the Aeneid during the last eleven years of his life ( 29–19 BC ) , commissioned , according to Propertius , by Augustus . The epic poem consists of 12 books in dactylic hexameter verse which describe the journey of Aeneas , a warrior fleeing the sack of Troy , to Italy , his battle with the Italian prince Turnus , and the foundation of a city from which Rome would emerge . The Aeneid 's first six books describe the journey of Aeneas from Troy to Rome . Virgil made use of several models in the composition of his epic ; Homer , the preeminent author of classical epic , is everywhere present , but Virgil also makes special use of the Latin poet Ennius and the Hellenistic poet Apollonius of Rhodes among the various other writers to which he alludes . Although the Aeneid casts itself firmly into the epic mode , it often seeks to expand the genre by including elements of other genres such as tragedy and aetiological poetry . Ancient commentators noted that Virgil seems to divide the Aeneid into two sections based on the poetry of Homer ; the first six books were viewed as employing the Odyssey as a model while the last six were connected to the Iliad .
SC Bern is the major ice hockey team of Bern who plays at the PostFinance Arena . The team has ranked highest in attendance for a European hockey team for more than a decade . The PostFinance Arena was the main host of the 2009 IIHF Ice Hockey World Championship , including the opening game and the final of the tournament .
The service started on 1 September 1993 based on the idea from the then chief executive officer , Sam Chisholm and Rupert Murdoch , of converting the company business strategy to an entirely fee-based concept . The new package included four channels formerly available free-to-air , broadcasting on Astra 's satellites , as well as introducing new channels . The service continued until the closure of BSkyB 's analogue service on 27 September 2001 , due to the launch and expansion of the Sky Digital platform . Some of the channels did broadcast either in the clear or soft encrypted ( whereby a Videocrypt decoder was required to decode , without a subscription card ) prior to their addition to the Sky Multichannels package . Within two months of the launch , BSkyB gained 400,000 new subscribers , with the majority taking at least one premium channel as well , which helped BSkyB reach 3.5 million households by mid-1994 . Michael Grade criticized the operations in front of the Select Committee on National Heritage , mainly for the lack of original programming on many of the new channels .
CBS provided digital streams of the game via CBSSports.com , and the CBS Sports apps on tablets , Windows 10 , Xbox One and other digital media players ( such as Chromecast and Roku ) . Due to Verizon Communications exclusivity , streaming on smartphones was only provided to Verizon Wireless customers via the NFL Mobile service . The ESPN Deportes Spanish broadcast was made available through WatchESPN .
In October 1529 , Philip I , Landgrave of Hesse , convoked an assembly of German and Swiss theologians at the Marburg Colloquy , to establish doctrinal unity in the emerging Protestant states . Agreement was achieved on fourteen points out of fifteen , the exception being the nature of the Eucharist – the sacrament of the Lord 's Supper—an issue crucial to Luther .
The doctrine of the immaculate conception ( Mary being conceived free from original sin ) is not to be confused with her virginal conception of her son Jesus . This misunderstanding of the term immaculate conception is frequently met in the mass media . Catholics believe that Mary was not the product of a virginal conception herself but was the daughter of a human father and mother , traditionally known by the names of Saint Joachim and Saint Anne . In 1677 , the Holy See condemned the belief that Mary was virginally conceived , which had been a belief surfacing occasionally since the 4th century . The Church celebrates the Feast of the Immaculate Conception ( when Mary was conceived free from original sin ) on 8 December , exactly nine months before celebrating the Nativity of Mary . The feast of the Annunciation ( which commemorates the virginal conception and the Incarnation of Jesus ) is celebrated on 25 March , nine months before Christmas Day .
The last regular election of the City Parliament was held on 25 November 2012 for the mandate period ( German : Legislatur , French : la législature ) from 2013 to 2016 .

The following parties combine their parliamentary power in parliamentary groups ( German : Fraktion ( en ) ) : Independent and AL and GPB-DA and PdA ( 4 ) , SP ( 23 ) , GB and JA ! ( 9 ) , GFL and EVP ( 10 ) , GLP ( 7 ) , BDP and CVP ( 9 ) , FDP ( 7 ) , and SVP ( 11 ) . This gives the left parties an absolute majority of 46 seats .
The Neapolitan style has an almond-shaped body resembling a bowl , constructed from curved strips of wood . It usually has a bent sound table , canted in two planes with the design to take the tension of the 8 metal strings arranged in four courses . A hardwood fingerboard sits on top of or is flush with the sound table . Very old instruments may use wooden tuning pegs , while newer instruments tend to use geared metal tuners . The bridge is a movable length of hardwood . A pickguard is glued below the sound hole under the strings . European roundbacks commonly use a 13-inch scale instead of the 13.876 common on archtop Mandolins .
Denver took the opening kickoff and started out strong with Peyton Manning completing an 18-yard pass to tight end Owen Daniels and a 22-yard throw to receiver Andre Caldwell . A pair of carries by C. J. Anderson moved the ball up 20 yards to the Panthers 14-yard line , but Carolina 's defense dug in over the next three plays . First , linebacker Shaq Thompson tackled Ronnie Hillman for a 3-yard loss . Then after an incompletion , Thomas Davis tackled Anderson for a 1-yard gain on third down , forcing Denver to settle for a 3–0 lead on a Brandon McManus 34-yard field goal . The score marked the first time in the entire postseason that Carolina was facing a deficit .
The works of Virgil almost from the moment of their publication revolutionized Latin poetry . The Eclogues , Georgics , and above all the Aeneid became standard texts in school curricula with which all educated Romans were familiar . Poets following Virgil often refer intertextually to his works to generate meaning in their own poetry . The Augustan poet Ovid parodies the opening lines of the Aeneid in Amores 1.1.1–2 , and his summary of the Aeneas story in Book 14 of the Metamorphoses , the so-called " mini-Aeneid " , has been viewed as a particularly important example of post-Virgilian response to the epic genre . Lucan 's epic , the Bellum Civile has been considered an anti-Virgilian epic , disposing with the divine mechanism , treating historical events , and diverging drastically from Virgilian epic practice . The Flavian poet Statius in his 12-book epic Thebaid engages closely with the poetry of Virgil ; in his epilogue he advises his poem not to " rival the divine Aeneid , but follow afar and ever venerate its footsteps . " In Silius Italicus , Virgil finds one of his most ardent admirers . With almost every line of his epic Punica Silius references Virgil . Indeed , Silius is known to have bought Virgil 's tomb and worshipped the poet . Partially as a result of his so-called " Messianic " Fourth Eclogue—widely interpreted later to have predicted the birth of Jesus Christ—Virgil was in later antiquity imputed to have the magical abilities of a seer ; the Sortes Vergilianae , the process of using Virgil 's poetry as a tool of divination , is found in the time of Hadrian , and continued into the Middle Ages . In a similar vein Macrobius in the Saturnalia credits the work of Virgil as the embodiment of human knowledge and experience , mirroring the Greek conception of Homer . Virgil also found commentators in antiquity . Servius , a commentator of the 4th century AD , based his work on the commentary of Donatus . Servius ' commentary provides us with a great deal of information about Virgil 's life , sources , and references ; however , many modern scholars find the variable quality of his work and the often simplistic interpretations frustrating .
Laing 's definition of identity closely follows Erikson 's , in emphasising the past , present and future components of the experienced self . He also develops the concept of the " metaperspective of self " , i.e . the self 's perception of the other 's view of self , which has been found to be extremely important in clinical contexts such as anorexia nervosa . ( Saunderson and O'Kane , 2005 ) . Harré also conceptualises components of self/identity – the " person " ( the unique being I am to myself and others ) along with aspects of self ( including a totality of attributes including beliefs about one 's characteristics including life history ) , and the personal characteristics displayed to others .
Bern lies on the Swiss plateau in the Canton of Bern , slightly west of the centre of Switzerland and 20 km ( 12 mi ) north of the Bernese Alps . The countryside around Bern was formed by glaciers during the most recent Ice Age . The two mountains closest to Bern are Gurten with a height of 864 m ( 2,835 ft ) and Bantiger with a height of 947 m ( 3,107 ft ) . The site of the old observatory in Bern is the point of origin of the CH1903 coordinate system at 46°57′08.66″N 7°26′22.50″E﻿ / ﻿46.9524056°N 7.4395833°E﻿ / 46.9524056 ; 7.4395833 .
ARC was acquired in 1938 by the Columbia Broadcasting System ( CBS , which , in turn , had been formed by the Columbia Phonograph Company , but then sold off ) . ARC was renamed Columbia Recording Corporation . The Columbia Phonograph Company had international subsidiaries and affiliates such as the Columbia Graphophone Company in the United Kingdom , but they were sold off prior to CBS acquiring American Columbia . RCA Victor Records executive Ted Wallerstein convinced CBS head William S. Paley to buy ARC and Paley made Wallerstein head of the newly acquired record company . The renamed company made Columbia its flagship label with Okeh its subsidiary label while deemphasizing ARC 's other labels . This allowed ARC 's leased labels Brunswick Records and Vocalion Records to revert to former owner Warner Bros. which sold the labels to Decca Records . Columbia kept the Brunswick catalogue recorded from December 1931 onward which was reissued on the Columbia label as well as the Vocalion label material from the same time period which was reissued on the Okeh label . Wallerstein , who was promoted at the end of 1947 from president to chairman of the record company , restored Columbia 's status as a leading record company and spearheaded the successful introduction of the long playing ( LP ) record before he retired as Columbia 's chairman in 1951 . James Conkling then became head of Columbia Records . Also in 1951 , Columbia severed its ties with the EMI-owned record label of the same name and began a UK distribution deal with Philips Records , whereas Okeh Records continued to be distributed by EMI on the Columbia label .
The Panthers used the San Jose State practice facility and stayed at the San Jose Marriott . The Broncos practiced at Stanford University and stayed at the Santa Clara Marriott .
Concerns were raised over whether Levi 's Stadium 's field was of a high enough quality to host a Super Bowl ; during the inaugural season , the field had to be re-sodded multiple times due to various issues , and during a week 6 game earlier in the 2015 season , a portion of the turf collapsed under Baltimore Ravens kicker Justin Tucker , causing him to slip and miss a field goal , although the field has not had any major issues since . As is customary for Super Bowl games played at natural grass stadiums , the NFL re-sodded the field with a new playing surface ; a hybrid Bermuda 419 turf . NFL and Atlanta Braves field director Ed Mangan stated that the field was in " great shape " for gameday . However , the turf showed problem throughout the game , with a number of players needing to change their cleats during the game and player slipping during plays all throughout the game .
According to the Office for National Statistics , at the 2001 census there were over a million black people in the United Kingdom ; 1 % of the total population described themselves as " Black Caribbean " , 0.8 % as " Black African " , and 0.2 % as " Black other " . Britain encouraged the immigration of workers from the Caribbean after World War II ; the first symbolic movement was those who came on the ship the Empire Windrush . The preferred official umbrella term is " black and minority ethnic " ( BME ) , but sometimes the term " black " is used on its own , to express unified opposition to racism , as in the Southall Black Sisters , which started with a mainly British Asian constituency , and the National Black Police Association , which has a membership of " African , African-Caribbean and Asian origin " .
Despite the disagreements on the Eucharist , the Marburg Colloquy paved the way for the signing in 1530 of the Augsburg Confession , and for the formation of the Schmalkaldic League the following year by leading Protestant nobles such as John of Saxony , Philip of Hesse , and George , Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach . The Swiss cities , however , did not sign these agreements .
Martin Luther was born to Hans Luder ( or Ludher , later Luther ) and his wife Margarethe ( née Lindemann ) on 10 November 1483 in Eisleben , Saxony , then part of the Holy Roman Empire . He was baptized as a Catholic the next morning on the feast day of St. Martin of Tours . His family moved to Mansfeld in 1484 , where his father was a leaseholder of copper mines and smelters and served as one of four citizen representatives on the local council . The religious scholar Martin Marty describes Luther 's mother as a hard-working woman of " trading-class stock and middling means " and notes that Luther 's enemies later wrongly described her as a whore and bath attendant . He had several brothers and sisters , and is known to have been close to one of them , Jacob . Hans Luther was ambitious for himself and his family , and he was determined to see Martin , his eldest son , become a lawyer . He sent Martin to Latin schools in Mansfeld , then Magdeburg in 1497 , where he attended a school operated by a lay group called the Brethren of the Common Life , and Eisenach in 1498 . The three schools focused on the so-called " trivium " : grammar , rhetoric , and logic . Luther later compared his education there to purgatory and hell .
Zinc serves a purely structural role in zinc fingers , twists and clusters . Zinc fingers form parts of some transcription factors , which are proteins that recognize DNA base sequences during the replication and transcription of DNA . Each of the nine or ten Zn2+ ions in a zinc finger helps maintain the finger 's structure by coordinately binding to four amino acids in the transcription factor . The transcription factor wraps around the DNA helix and uses its fingers to accurately bind to the DNA sequence .
The apartheid bureaucracy devised complex ( and often arbitrary ) criteria in the Population Registration Act of 1945 to determine who belonged in which group . Minor officials administered tests to enforce the classifications . When it was unclear from a person 's physical appearance whether the individual should be considered Coloured or Black , the " pencil test " was used . A pencil was inserted into a person 's hair to determine if the hair was kinky enough to hold the pencil , rather than having it pass through , as it would with smoother hair . If so , the person was classified as Black . Such classifications sometimes divided families .
In cities other than Rome , the name cardinal began to be applied to certain church men as a mark of honour . The earliest example of this occurs in a letter sent by Pope Zacharias in 747 to Pippin III ( the Short ) , ruler of the Franks , in which Zacharias applied the title to the priests of Paris to distinguish them from country clergy . This meaning of the word spread rapidly , and from the 9th century various episcopal cities had a special class among the clergy known as cardinals . The use of the title was reserved for the cardinals of Rome in 1567 by Pius V .
The effect of Luther 's intervention was immediate . After the sixth sermon , the Wittenberg jurist Jerome Schurf wrote to the elector : " Oh , what joy has Dr. Martin 's return spread among us ! His words , through divine mercy , are bringing back every day misguided people into the way of the truth . "
Most of the population ( as of 2000 [ update ] ) speaks German ( 104,465 or 81.2 % ) as their first language , Italian is the second most common ( 5,062 or 3.9 % ) and French is the third ( 4,671 or 3.6 % ) . There are 171 people who speak Romansh .
As African states became independent in the 1960s , the Soviet Union offered many of their citizens the chance to study in Russia . Over a period of 40 years , about 400,000 African students from various countries moved to Russia to pursue higher studies , including many Black Africans . This extended beyond the Soviet Union to many countries of the Eastern bloc .
Some consider koshari ( a mixture of rice , lentils , and macaroni ) to be the national dish . Fried onions can be also added to koshari . In addition , ful medames ( mashed fava beans ) is one of the most popular dishes . Fava bean is also used in making falafel ( also known as " ta'meyya " ) , which may have originated in Egypt and spread to other parts of the Middle East . Garlic fried with coriander is added to mulukhiyya , a popular green soup made from finely chopped jute leaves , sometimes with chicken or rabbit .
Weinreich 's identity variant similarly includes the categories of identity diffusion , foreclosure and crisis , but with a somewhat different emphasis . Here , with respect to identity diffusion for example , an optimal level is interpreted as the norm , as it is unrealistic to expect an individual to resolve all their conflicted identifications with others ; therefore we should be alert to individuals with levels which are much higher or lower than the norm – highly diffused individuals are classified as diffused , and those with low levels as foreclosed or defensive . ( Weinreich & Saunderson , 2003 , pp 65–67 ; 105-106 ) . Weinreich applies the identity variant in a framework which also allows for the transition from one to another by way of biographical experiences and resolution of conflicted identifications situated in various contexts – for example , an adolescent going through family break-up may be in one state , whereas later in a stable marriage with a secure professional role may be in another . Hence , though there is continuity , there is also development and change . ( Weinreich & Saunderson , 2003 , pp 22–23 ) .
Following their loss in the divisional round of the previous season 's playoffs , the Denver Broncos underwent numerous coaching changes , including a mutual parting with head coach John Fox ( who had won four divisional championships in his four years as Broncos head coach ) , and the hiring of Gary Kubiak as the new head coach . Under Kubiak , the Broncos planned to install a run-oriented offense with zone blocking to blend in with quarterback Peyton Manning 's shotgun passing skills , but struggled with numerous changes and injuries to the offensive line , as well as Manning having his worst statistical season since his rookie year with the Indianapolis Colts in 1998 , due to a plantar fasciitis injury in his heel that he had suffered since the summer , and the simple fact that Manning was getting old , as he turned 39 in the 2015 off-season . Although the team had a 7–0 start , Manning led the NFL in interceptions . In week 10 , Manning suffered a partial tear of the plantar fasciitis in his left foot . He set the NFL 's all-time record for career passing yards in this game , but was benched after throwing four interceptions in favor of backup quarterback Brock Osweiler , who took over as the starter for most of the remainder of the regular season . Osweiler was injured , however , leading to Manning 's return during the Week 17 regular season finale , where the Broncos were losing 13–7 against the 4–11 San Diego Chargers , resulting in Manning re-claiming the starting quarterback position for the playoffs by leading the team to a key 27–20 win that enabled the team to clinch the number one overall AFC seed . Under defensive coordinator Wade Phillips , the Broncos ' defense ranked number one in total yards allowed , passing yards allowed and sacks , and like the previous three seasons , the team has continued to set numerous individual , league and franchise records . With the defense carrying the team despite the issues with the offense , the Broncos finished the regular season with a 12–4 record and earned home-field advantage throughout the AFC playoffs .
Sometime after the publication of the Eclogues ( probably before 37 BC ) , Virgil became part of the circle of Maecenas , Octavian 's capable agent d'affaires who sought to counter sympathy for Antony among the leading families by rallying Roman literary figures to Octavian 's side . Virgil came to know many of the other leading literary figures of the time , including Horace , in whose poetry he is often mentioned , and Varius Rufus , who later helped finish the Aeneid .
The enforcement of the ban on the 95 Theses fell to the secular authorities . On 18 April 1521 , Luther appeared as ordered before the Diet of Worms . This was a general assembly of the estates of the Holy Roman Empire that took place in Worms , a town on the Rhine . It was conducted from 28 January to 25 May 1521 , with Emperor Charles V presiding . Prince Frederick III , Elector of Saxony , obtained a safe conduct for Luther to and from the meeting .
Some succeeded their fathers as rulers , such as Sultan Ahmad al-Mansur , who ruled Morocco from 1578 to 1608 . He was not technically considered as a mixed-race child of a slave ; his mother was Fulani and a concubine of his father . Such tolerance for black persons , even when technically " free " , was not so common in Morocco . The long association of sub-Saharan peoples as slaves is shown in the term abd ( Arabic : عبد‎ , ) ( meaning " slave " ) ; it is still frequently used in the Arabic-speaking world as a term for black people .
The instrument was primarily used in an ensemble setting well into the 1930s , and although the fad died out at the beginning of the 1930s , the instruments that were developed for the orchestra found a new home in bluegrass . The famous Lloyd Loar Master Model from Gibson ( 1923 ) was designed to boost the flagging interest in mandolin ensembles , with little success . However , The " Loar " became the defining instrument of bluegrass music when Bill Monroe purchased F-5 S/N 73987 in a Florida barbershop in 1943 and popularized it as his main instrument .
Some established acts continued to enjoy commercial success , such as Aerosmith , with their number one multi-platinum albums : Get a Grip ( 1993 ) , which produced four Top 40 singles and became the band 's best-selling album worldwide ( going on to sell over 10 million copies ) , and Nine Lives ( 1997 ) . In 1998 , Aerosmith released the number one hit " I Do n't Want to Miss a Thing " , which remains the only single by a hard rock band to debut at number one . AC/DC produced the double platinum Ballbreaker ( 1995 ) . Bon Jovi appealed to their hard rock audience with songs such as " Keep the Faith " ( 1992 ) , but also achieved success in adult contemporary radio , with the Top 10 ballads " Bed of Roses " ( 1993 ) and " Always " ( 1994 ) . Bon Jovi 's 1995 album These Days was a bigger hit in Europe than it was in the United States , spawning four Top 10 singles on the UK Singles Chart . Metallica 's Load ( 1996 ) and ReLoad ( 1997 ) each sold in excess of 4 million copies in the US and saw the band develop a more melodic and blues rock sound . As the initial impetus of grunge bands faltered in the middle years of the decade , post-grunge bands emerged . They emulated the attitudes and music of grunge , particularly thick , distorted guitars , but with a more radio-friendly commercially oriented sound that drew more directly on traditional hard rock . Among the most successful acts were the Foo Fighters , Candlebox , Live , Collective Soul , Australia 's Silverchair and England 's Bush , who all cemented post-grunge as one of the most commercially viable subgenres by the late 1990s . Similarly , some post-Britpop bands that followed in the wake of Oasis , including Feeder and Stereophonics , adopted a hard rock or " pop-metal " sound .
The bandolim ( Portuguese for " mandolin " ) was a favourite instrument within the Portuguese bourgeoisie of the 19th century , but its rapid spread took it to other places , joining other instruments . Today you can see mandolins as part of the traditional and folk culture of Portuguese singing groups and the majority of the mandolin scene in Portugal is in Madeira Island . Madeira has over 17 active mandolin Orchestras and Tunas . The mandolin virtuoso Fabio Machado is one of Portugal 's most accomplished mandolin players . The Portuguese influence brought the mandolin to Brazil .
UNFPA works in partnership with governments , along with other United Nations agencies , communities , NGOs , foundations and the private sector , to raise awareness and mobilize the support and resources needed to achieve its mission to promote the rights and health of women and young people .
The effect of Luther 's intervention was immediate . After the sixth sermon , the Wittenberg jurist Jerome Schurf wrote to the elector : " Oh , what joy has Dr. Martin 's return spread among us ! His words , through divine mercy , are bringing back every day misguided people into the way of the truth . "
From December 1539 , Luther became implicated in the bigamy of Philip I , Landgrave of Hesse , who wanted to marry one of his wife 's ladies-in-waiting . Philip solicited the approval of Luther , Melanchthon , and Bucer , citing as a precedent the polygamy of the patriarchs . The theologians were not prepared to make a general ruling , and they reluctantly advised the landgrave that if he was determined , he should marry secretly and keep quiet about the matter . As a result , on 4 March 1540 , Philip married a second wife , Margarethe von der Saale , with Melanchthon and Bucer among the witnesses . However , Philip was unable to keep the marriage secret , and he threatened to make Luther 's advice public . Luther told him to " tell a good , strong lie " and deny the marriage completely , which Philip did during the subsequent public controversy . In the view of Luther 's biographer Martin Brecht , " giving confessional advice for Philip of Hesse was one of the worst mistakes Luther made , and , next to the landgrave himself , who was directly responsible for it , history chiefly holds Luther accountable " . Brecht argues that Luther 's mistake was not that he gave private pastoral advice , but that he miscalculated the political implications . The affair caused lasting damage to Luther 's reputation .
In March 2010 , Sony Corp has partnered with The Michael Jackson Company with a contract of more than $ 250 million , the largest deal in recorded music history .
The annual NFL Experience was held at the Moscone Center in San Francisco . In addition , " Super Bowl City " opened on January 30 at Justin Herman Plaza on The Embarcadero , featuring games and activities that will highlight the Bay Area 's technology , culinary creations , and cultural diversity . More than 1 million people are expected to attend the festivities in San Francisco during Super Bowl Week . San Francisco mayor Ed Lee said of the highly visible homeless presence in this area " they are going to have to leave " . San Francisco city supervisor Jane Kim unsuccessfully lobbied for the NFL to reimburse San Francisco for city services in the amount of $ 5 million .
Chanakya , 4th Century BC Indian political philosopher . The Arthashastra provides an account of the science of politics for a wise ruler , policies for foreign affairs and wars , the system of a spy state and surveillance and economic stability of the state . Chanakya quotes several authorities including Bruhaspati , Ushanas , Prachetasa Manu , Parasara , and Ambi , and described himself as a descendant of a lineage of political philosophers , with his father Chanaka being his immediate predecessor . Another influential extant Indian treatise on political philosophy is the Sukra Neeti . An example of a code of law in ancient India is the Manusmṛti or Laws of Manu .
By 750 , the feast of her conception was widely celebrated in the Byzantine East , under the name of the Conception ( active ) of Saint Anne . In the West it was known as the feast of the Conception ( passive ) of Mary , and was associated particularly with the Normans , whether these introduced it directly from the East or took it from English usage . The spread of the feast , by now with the adjective " Immaculate " attached to its title , met opposition on the part of some , on the grounds that sanctification was possible only after conception . Critics included Saints Bernard of Clairvaux , Albertus Magnus and Thomas Aquinas . Other theologians defended the expression " Immaculate Conception " , pointing out that sanctification could be conferred at the first moment of conception in view of the foreseen merits of Christ , a view held especially by Franciscans .
The element was probably named by the alchemist Paracelsus after the German word Zinke ( prong , tooth ) . German chemist Andreas Sigismund Marggraf is credited with discovering pure metallic zinc in 1746 . Work by Luigi Galvani and Alessandro Volta uncovered the electrochemical properties of zinc by 1800 . Corrosion-resistant zinc plating of iron ( hot-dip galvanizing ) is the major application for zinc . Other applications are in batteries , small non-structural castings , and alloys , such as brass . A variety of zinc compounds are commonly used , such as zinc carbonate and zinc gluconate ( as dietary supplements ) , zinc chloride ( in deodorants ) , zinc pyrithione ( anti-dandruff shampoos ) , zinc sulfide ( in luminescent paints ) , and zinc methyl or zinc diethyl in the organic laboratory .
Martin Luther ( /ˈluːθər/ or /ˈluːðər/ ; German : [ ˈmaɐ̯tiːn ˈlʊtɐ ] ( listen ) ; 10 November 1483 – 18 February 1546 ) was a German professor of theology , composer , priest , former monk and a seminal figure in the Protestant Reformation . Luther came to reject several teachings and practices of the Late Medieval Catholic Church . He strongly disputed the claim that freedom from God 's punishment for sin could be purchased with money . He proposed an academic discussion of the power and usefulness of indulgences in his Ninety-Five Theses of 1517 . His refusal to retract all of his writings at the demand of Pope Leo X in 1520 and the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V at the Diet of Worms in 1521 resulted in his excommunication by the Pope and condemnation as an outlaw by the Emperor .
These styles generally have either two f-shaped soundholes like a violin ( F-5 and A-5 ) , or an oval sound hole ( F-4 and A-4 and lower models ) directly under the strings . Much variation exists between makers working from these archetypes , and other variants have become increasingly common . Generally , in the United States , Gibson F-hole F-5 mandolins and mandolins influenced by that design are strongly associated with bluegrass , while the A-style is associated other types of music , although it too is most often used for and associated with bluegrass . The F-5 's more complicated woodwork also translates into a more expensive instrument .
Established bands made something of a comeback in the mid-1980s . After an 8-year separation , Deep Purple returned with the classic Machine Head line-up to produce Perfect Strangers ( 1984 ) , which reached number five in the UK , hit the top five in five other countries , and was a platinum-seller in the US . After somewhat slower sales of its fourth album , Fair Warning , Van Halen rebounded with the Top 3 album Diver Down in 1982 , then reached their commercial pinnacle with 1984 . It reached number two on the Billboard album chart and provided the track " Jump " , which reached number one on the singles chart and remained there for several weeks . Heart , after floundering during the first half of the decade , made a comeback with their eponymous ninth studio album which hit number one and contained four Top 10 singles including their first number one hit . The new medium of video channels was used with considerable success by bands formed in previous decades . Among the first were ZZ Top , who mixed hard blues rock with new wave music to produce a series of highly successful singles , beginning with " Gim me All Your Lovin ' " ( 1983 ) , which helped their albums Eliminator ( 1983 ) and Afterburner ( 1985 ) achieve diamond and multi-platinum status respectively . Others found renewed success in the singles charts with power ballads , including REO Speedwagon with " Keep on Loving You " ( 1980 ) and " Ca n't Fight This Feeling " ( 1984 ) , Journey with " Do n't Stop Believin ' " ( 1981 ) and " Open Arms " ( 1982 ) , Foreigner 's " I Want to Know What Love Is " , Scorpions ' " Still Loving You " ( both from 1984 ) , Heart ’ s " What About Love " ( 1985 ) and " These Dreams " ( 1986 ) , and Boston 's " Amanda " ( 1986 ) .
The negotiations were successfully concluded on 17 February 1546 . After 8 a.m. , he experienced chest pains . When he went to his bed , he prayed , " Into your hand I commit my spirit ; you have redeemed me , O Lord , faithful God " ( Ps . 31:5 ) , the common prayer of the dying . At 1 a.m. he awoke with more chest pain and was warmed with hot towels . He thanked God for revealing his Son to him in whom he had believed . His companions , Justus Jonas and Michael Coelius , shouted loudly , " Reverend father , are you ready to die trusting in your Lord Jesus Christ and to confess the doctrine which you have taught in his name ? " A distinct " Yes " was Luther 's reply .
The early Christian philosophy of Augustine of Hippo was heavily influenced by Plato . A key change brought about by Christian thought was the moderatation of the Stoicism and theory of justice of the Roman world , as well emphasis on the role of the state in applying mercy as a moral example . Augustine also preached that one was not a member of his or her city , but was either a citizen of the City of God ( Civitas Dei ) or the City of Man ( Civitas Terrena ) . Augustine 's City of God is an influential work of this period that attacked the thesis , held by many Christian Romans , that the Christian view could be realized on Earth .
The name of the metal was probably first documented by Paracelsus , a Swiss-born German alchemist , who referred to the metal as " zincum " or " zinken " in his book Liber Mineralium II , in the 16th century . The word is probably derived from the German zinke , and supposedly meant " tooth-like , pointed or jagged " ( metallic zinc crystals have a needle-like appearance ) . Zink could also imply " tin-like " because of its relation to German zinn meaning tin . Yet another possibility is that the word is derived from the Persian word سنگ seng meaning stone . The metal was also called Indian tin , tutanego , calamine , and spinter .
Historians estimate that between the advent of Islam in 650CE and the abolition of slavery in the Arabian Peninsula in the mid-20th century , 10 to 18 million sub-Saharan Black Africans were enslaved by Arab slave traders and transported to the Arabian Peninsula and neighboring countries . This number far exceeded the number of slaves who were taken to the Americas . Several factors affected the visibility of descendants of this diaspora in 21st-century Arab societies : The traders shipped more female slaves than males , as there was a demand for them to serve as concubines in harems in the Arabian Peninsula and neighboring countries . Male slaves were castrated in order to serve as harem guards . The death toll of Black African slaves from forced labor was high . The mixed-race children of female slaves and Arab owners were assimilated into the Arab owners ' families under the patrilineal kinship system . As a result , few distinctive Afro-Arab black communities have survived in the Arabian Peninsula and neighboring countries .
His last sermon was delivered at Eisleben , his place of birth , on 15 February 1546 , three days before his death . It was " entirely devoted to the obdurate Jews , whom it was a matter of great urgency to expel from all German territory , " according to Léon Poliakov . James Mackinnon writes that it concluded with a " fiery summons to drive the Jews bag and baggage from their midst , unless they desisted from their calumny and their usury and became Christians . " Luther said , " we want to practice Christian love toward them and pray that they convert , " but also that they are " our public enemies ... and if they could kill us all , they would gladly do so . And so often they do . "
The second decline was not as complete as the first . Thousands of people had learned to play the instrument . Even as the second wave of mandolin popularity declined in the early 20th century , new versions of the mandolin began to be used in new forms of music . Luthiers created the resonator mandolin , the flatback mandolin , the carved-top or arched-top mandolin , the mandolin-banjo and the electric mandolin . Musicians began playing it in Celtic , Bluegrass , Jazz and Rock-n-Roll styles — and Classical too .
Egypt was producing 691,000 bbl/d of oil and 2,141.05 Tcf of natural gas ( in 2013 ) , which makes Egypt as the largest oil producer not member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries ( OPEC ) and the second-largest dry natural gas producer in Africa . In 2013 , Egypt was the largest consumer of oil and natural gas in Africa , as more than 20 % of total oil consumption and more than 40 % of total dry natural gas consumption in Africa . Also , Egypt possesses the largest oil refinery capacity in Africa 726,000 bbl/d ( in 2012 ) . Egypt is currently planning to build its first nuclear power plant in El Dabaa city , northern Egypt .
Super Bowl 50 featured numerous records from individuals and teams . Denver won despite being massively outgained in total yards ( 315 to 194 ) and first downs ( 21 to 11 ) . Their 194 yards and 11 first downs were both the lowest totals ever by a Super Bowl winning team . The previous record was 244 yards by the Baltimore Ravens in Super Bowl XXXV . Only seven other teams had ever gained less than 200 yards in a Super Bowl , and all of them had lost . The Broncos ' seven sacks tied a Super Bowl record set by the Chicago Bears in Super Bowl XX . Kony Ealy tied a Super Bowl record with three sacks . Jordan Norwood 's 61-yard punt return set a new record , surpassing the old record of 45 yards set by John Taylor in Super Bowl XXIII . Denver was just 1-of-14 on third down , while Carolina was barely better at 3-of-15 . The two teams ' combined third down conversion percentage of 13.8 was a Super Bowl low . Manning and Newton had quarterback passer ratings of 56.6 and 55.4 , respectively , and their added total of 112 is a record lowest aggregate passer rating for a Super Bowl . Manning became the oldest quarterback ever to win a Super Bowl at age 39 , and the first quarterback ever to win a Super Bowl with two different teams , while Gary Kubiak became the first head coach to win a Super Bowl with the same franchise he went to the Super Bowl with as a player .
Luther wrote " Ach Gott , vom Himmel sieh darein " ( " Oh God , look down from heaven " ) . " Nun komm , der Heiden Heiland " ( Now come , Savior of the gentiles ) , based on Veni redemptor gentium , became the main hymn ( Hauptlied ) for Advent . He transformed A solus ortus cardine to " Christum wir sollen loben schon " ( " We should now praise Christ " ) and Veni Creator Spiritus to " Komm , Gott Schöpfer , Heiliger Geist " ( " Come , Holy Spirit , Lord God " ) . He wrote two hymns on the Ten Commandments , " Dies sind die heilgen Zehn Gebot " and " Mensch , willst du leben seliglich " . His " Gelobet seist du , Jesu Christ " ( " Praise be to You , Jesus Christ " ) became the main hymn for Christmas . He wrote for Pentecost " Nun bitten wir den Heiligen Geist " , and adopted for Easter " Christ ist erstanden " ( Christ is risen ) , based on Victimae paschali laudes . " Mit Fried und Freud ich fahr dahin " , a paraphrase of Nunc dimittis , was intended for Purification , but became also a funeral hymn . He paraphrased the Te Deum as " Herr Gott , dich loben wir " with a simplified form of the melody . It became known as the German Te Deum .
The Panthers used the San Jose State practice facility and stayed at the San Jose Marriott . The Broncos practiced at Stanford University and stayed at the Santa Clara Marriott .
During Mubarak 's reign , the political scene was dominated by the National Democratic Party , which was created by Sadat in 1978 . It passed the 1993 Syndicates Law , 1995 Press Law , and 1999 Nongovernmental Associations Law which hampered freedoms of association and expression by imposing new regulations and draconian penalties on violations . [ citation needed ] As a result , by the late 1990s parliamentary politics had become virtually irrelevant and alternative avenues for political expression were curtailed as well .
The medieval city is a foundation of the Zähringer ruling family , which rose to power in Upper Burgundy in the 12th century . According to 14th century historiography ( Cronica de Berno , 1309 ) , Bern was founded in 1191 by Berthold V , Duke of Zähringen .
Luther 's hymns were included in early Lutheran hymnals and spread the ideas of the Reformation . He supplied four of eight songs of the First Lutheran hymnal Achtliederbuch , 18 of 26 songs of the Erfurt Enchiridion , and 24 of the 32 songs in the first choral hymnal with settings by Johann Walter , Eyn geystlich Gesangk Buchleyn , all published in 1524 .
Sony renamed the record company Sony Music Entertainment ( SME ) on January 1 , 1991 , fulfilling the terms set under the 1988 buyout , which granted only a transitional license to the CBS trademark . The CBS Associated label was renamed Epic Associated . Also on January 1 , 1991 , to replace the CBS label , Sony reintroduced the Columbia label worldwide , which it previously held in the United States and Canada only , after it acquired the international rights to the trademark from EMI in 1990 . Japan is the only country where Sony does not have rights to the Columbia name as it is controlled by Nippon Columbia , an unrelated company . Thus , until this day , Sony Music Entertainment Japan does not use the Columbia trademark for Columbia label recordings from outside Japan which are issued in Japan . The Columbia Records trademark 's rightsholder in Spain was Bertelsmann Music Group , Germany , which Sony Music subsequently subsumed via a 2004 merger , followed by a 2008 buyout .

As of 2010 [ update ] , Bern had an unemployment rate of 3.3 % . As of 2008 [ update ] , there were 259 people employed in the primary economic sector and about 59 businesses involved in this sector . 16,413 people were employed in the secondary sector and there were 950 businesses in this sector . 135,973 people were employed in the tertiary sector , with 7,654 businesses in this sector .
After each team punted , Panthers quarterback Cam Newton appeared to complete a 24-yard pass Jerricho Cotchery , but the call was ruled an incompletion and upheld after a replay challenge . CBS analyst and retired referee Mike Carey stated he disagreed with the call and felt the review clearly showed the pass was complete . A few plays later , on 3rd-and-10 from the 15-yard line , linebacker Von Miller knocked the ball out of Newton 's hands while sacking him , and Malik Jackson recovered it in the end zone for a Broncos touchdown , giving the team a 10–0 lead . This was the first fumble return touchdown in a Super Bowl since Super Bowl XXVIII at the end of the 1993 season .
In the 1530s and 1540s , printed images of Luther that emphasized his monumental size were crucial to the spread of Protestantism . In contrast to images of frail Catholic saints , Luther was presented as a stout man with a " double chin , strong mouth , piercing deep-set eyes , fleshy face , and squat neck . " He was shown to be physically imposing , an equal in stature to the secular German princes with whom he would join forces to spread Lutheranism . His large body also let the viewer know that he did not shun earthly pleasures like drinking—behavior that was a stark contrast to the ascetic life of the medieval religious orders . Famous images from this period include the woodcuts by Hans Brosamer ( 1530 ) and Lucas Cranach the Elder and Lucas Cranach the Younger ( 1546 ) .
Publius Vergilius Maro ( Classical Latin : [ ˈpuː.blɪ.ʊs wɛrˈɡɪ.lɪ.ʊs ˈma.roː ] ; October 15 , 70 BC – September 21 , 19 BC ) , usually called Virgil or Vergil /ˈvɜːrdʒᵻl/ in English , was an ancient Roman poet of the Augustan period . He is known for three major works of Latin literature , the Eclogues ( or Bucolics ) , the Georgics , and the epic Aeneid . A number of minor poems , collected in the Appendix Vergiliana , are sometimes attributed to him .
A person may display either relative weakness or relative strength in terms of both exploration and commitments . When assigned categories , four possible permutations result : identity diffusion , identity foreclosure , identity moratorium , and identity achievement . Diffusion is when a person lacks both exploration in life and interest in committing even to those unchosen roles that he or she occupies . Foreclosure is when a person has not chosen extensively in the past , but seems willing to commit to some relevant values , goals , or roles in the future . Moratorium is when a person displays a kind of flightiness , ready to make choices but unable to commit to them . Finally , achievement is when a person makes identity choices and commits to them .
The Panthers defense gave up just 308 points , ranking sixth in the league , while also leading the NFL in interceptions with 24 and boasting four Pro Bowl selections . Pro Bowl defensive tackle Kawann Short led the team in sacks with 11 , while also forcing three fumbles and recovering two . Fellow lineman Mario Addison added 6½ sacks . The Panthers line also featured veteran defensive end Jared Allen , a 5-time pro bowler who was the NFL 's active career sack leader with 136 , along with defensive end Kony Ealy , who had 5 sacks in just 9 starts . Behind them , two of the Panthers three starting linebackers were also selected to play in the Pro Bowl : Thomas Davis and Luke Kuechly . Davis compiled 5½ sacks , four forced fumbles , and four interceptions , while Kuechly led the team in tackles ( 118 ) forced two fumbles , and intercepted four passes of his own . Carolina 's secondary featured Pro Bowl safety Kurt Coleman , who led the team with a career high seven interceptions , while also racking up 88 tackles and Pro Bowl cornerback Josh Norman , who developed into a shutdown corner during the season and had four interceptions , two of which were returned for touchdowns .
Denver took the opening kickoff and started out strong with Peyton Manning completing an 18-yard pass to tight end Owen Daniels and a 22-yard throw to receiver Andre Caldwell . A pair of carries by C. J. Anderson moved the ball up 20 yards to the Panthers 14-yard line , but Carolina 's defense dug in over the next three plays . First , linebacker Shaq Thompson tackled Ronnie Hillman for a 3-yard loss . Then after an incompletion , Thomas Davis tackled Anderson for a 1-yard gain on third down , forcing Denver to settle for a 3–0 lead on a Brandon McManus 34-yard field goal . The score marked the first time in the entire postseason that Carolina was facing a deficit .
A cardinal ( Latin : sanctae romanae ecclesiae cardinalis , literally cardinal of the Holy Roman Church ) is a senior ecclesiastical leader , an ecclesiastical prince , and usually ( now always for those created when still within the voting age-range ) an ordained bishop of the Roman Catholic Church . The cardinals of the Church are collectively known as the College of Cardinals . The duties of the cardinals include attending the meetings of the College and making themselves available individually or in groups to the Pope as requested . Most have additional duties , such as leading a diocese or archdiocese or managing a department of the Roman Curia . A cardinal 's primary duty is electing the pope when the see becomes vacant . During the sede vacante ( the period between a pope 's death or resignation and the election of his successor ) , the day-to-day governance of the Holy See is in the hands of the College of Cardinals . The right to enter the conclave of cardinals where the pope is elected is limited to those who have not reached the age of 80 years by the day the vacancy occurs .
Kenneth Gergen formulated additional classifications , which include the strategic manipulator , the pastiche personality , and the relational self . The strategic manipulator is a person who begins to regard all senses of identity merely as role-playing exercises , and who gradually becomes alienated from his or her social " self " . The pastiche personality abandons all aspirations toward a true or " essential " identity , instead viewing social interactions as opportunities to play out , and hence become , the roles they play . Finally , the relational self is a perspective by which persons abandon all sense of exclusive self , and view all sense of identity in terms of social engagement with others . For Gergen , these strategies follow one another in phases , and they are linked to the increase in popularity of postmodern culture and the rise of telecommunications technology .
The official language of Bern is ( the Swiss variety of Standard ) German , but the main spoken language is the Alemannic Swiss German dialect called Bernese German .
The cardinal deacons are the lowest-ranking cardinals . Cardinals elevated to the diaconal order are either officials of the Roman Curia or priests elevated after their 80th birthday . Bishops with diocesan responsibilities , however , are created cardinal priests .
The popularity of this particular representation of The Immaculate Conception spread across the rest of Europe , and has since remained the best known artistic depiction of the concept : in a heavenly realm , moments after her creation , the spirit of Mary ( in the form of a young woman ) looks up in awe at ( or bows her head to ) God . The moon is under her feet and a halo of twelve stars surround her head , possibly a reference to " a woman clothed with the sun " from Revelation 12:1-2 . Additional imagery may include clouds , a golden light , and cherubs . In some paintings the cherubim are holding lilies and roses , flowers often associated with Mary .
At the heart of scholars ' debate about Luther 's influence is whether it is anachronistic to view his work as a precursor of the racial antisemitism of the Nazis . Some scholars see Luther 's influence as limited , and the Nazis ' use of his work as opportunistic . Biographer Martin Brecht points out that " There is a world of difference between his belief in salvation and a racial ideology . Nevertheless , his misguided agitation had the evil result that Luther fatefully became one of the 'church fathers ' of anti-Semitism and thus provided material for the modern hatred of the Jews , cloaking it with the authority of the Reformer . " Johannes Wallmann argues that Luther 's writings against the Jews were largely ignored in the 18th and 19th centuries , and that there was no continuity between Luther 's thought and Nazi ideology . Uwe Siemon-Netto agreed , arguing that it was because the Nazis were already anti-Semites that they revived Luther 's work . Hans J. Hillerbrand agreed that to focus on Luther was to adopt an essentially ahistorical perspective of Nazi antisemitism that ignored other contributory factors in German history . Similarly , Roland Bainton , noted church historian and Luther biographer , wrote " One could wish that Luther had died before ever [ On the Jews and Their Lies ] was written . His position was entirely religious and in no respect racial . "
In the post-apartheid era , the Constitution of South Africa has declared the country to be a " Non-racial democracy " . In an effort to redress past injustices , the ANC government has introduced laws in support of affirmative action policies for Blacks ; under these they define " Black " people to include " Africans " , " Coloureds " and " Asians " . Some affirmative action policies favor " Africans " over " Coloureds " in terms of qualifying for certain benefits . Some South Africans categorized as " African Black " say that " Coloureds " did not suffer as much as they did during apartheid . " Coloured " South Africans are known to discuss their dilemma by saying , " we were not white enough under apartheid , and we are not black enough under the ANC ( African National Congress ) " .

Popular opinion remained firmly behind the celebration of Mary 's conception . In 1439 , the Council of Basel , which is not reckoned an ecumenical council , stated that belief in the immaculate conception of Mary is in accord with the Catholic faith . By the end of the 15th century the belief was widely professed and taught in many theological faculties , but such was the influence of the Dominicans , and the weight of the arguments of Thomas Aquinas ( who had been canonised in 1323 and declared " Doctor Angelicus " of the Church in 1567 ) that the Council of Trent ( 1545–63 ) —which might have been expected to affirm the doctrine—instead declined to take a position .
According to the commentators , Virgil received his first education when he was five years old and he later went to Cremona , Milan , and finally Rome to study rhetoric , medicine , and astronomy , which he soon abandoned for philosophy . From Virgil 's admiring references to the neoteric writers Pollio and Cinna , it has been inferred that he was , for a time , associated with Catullus ' neoteric circle . However schoolmates considered Virgil extremely shy and reserved , according to Servius , and he was nicknamed " Parthenias " or " maiden " because of his social aloofness . Virgil seems to have suffered bad health throughout his life and in some ways lived the life of an invalid . According to the Catalepton , while in the Epicurean school of Siro the Epicurean at Naples , he began to write poetry . A group of small works attributed to the youthful Virgil by the commentators survive collected under the title Appendix Vergiliana , but are largely considered spurious by scholars . One , the Catalepton , consists of fourteen short poems , some of which may be Virgil 's , and another , a short narrative poem titled the Culex ( " The Gnat " ) , was attributed to Virgil as early as the 1st century AD .
The concept of race in Brazil is complex . A Brazilian child was never automatically identified with the racial type of one or both of his or her parents , nor were there only two categories to choose from . Between an individual of unmixed West African descent and a very light mulatto individual , more than a dozen racial categories were acknowledged , based on various combinations of hair color , hair texture , eye color , and skin color . These types grade into each other like the colors of the spectrum , and no one category stands significantly isolated from the rest . In Brazil , people are classified by appearance , not heredity .
Peyton Manning became the first quarterback ever to lead two different teams to multiple Super Bowls . He is also the oldest quarterback ever to play in a Super Bowl at age 39 . The past record was held by John Elway , who led the Broncos to victory in Super Bowl XXXIII at age 38 and is currently Denver 's Executive Vice President of Football Operations and General Manager .
UNFPA began operations in 1969 as the United Nations Fund for Population Activities ( the name was changed in 1987 ) under the administration of the United Nations Development Fund . In 1971 it was placed under the authority of the United Nations General Assembly .
Bon Jovi 's third album , Slippery When Wet ( 1986 ) , mixed hard rock with a pop sensitivity and spent a total of 8 weeks at the top of the Billboard 200 album chart , selling 12 million copies in the US while becoming the first hard rock album to spawn three top 10 singles — two of which reached number one . The album has been credited with widening the audiences for the genre , particularly by appealing to women as well as the traditional male dominated audience , and opening the door to MTV and commercial success for other bands at the end of the decade . The anthemic The Final Countdown ( 1986 ) by Swedish group Europe was an international hit , reaching number eight on the US charts while hitting the top 10 in nine other countries . This era also saw more glam-infused American hard rock bands come to the forefront , with both Poison and Cinderella releasing their multi-platinum début albums in 1986 . Van Halen released 5150 ( 1986 ) , their first album with Sammy Hagar on lead vocals , which was number one in the US for three weeks and sold over 6 million copies . By the second half of the decade , hard rock had become the most reliable form of commercial popular music in the United States .
In early 1991 , non-Arabs of the Zaghawa tribe of Sudan attested that they were victims of an intensifying Arab apartheid campaign , segregating Arabs and non-Arabs ( specifically people of sub-Saharan African descent ) . Sudanese Arabs , who controlled the government , were widely referred to as practicing apartheid against Sudan 's non-Arab citizens . The government was accused of " deftly manipulat ( ing ) Arab solidarity " to carry out policies of apartheid and ethnic cleansing .

The ESPN Deportes Spanish broadcast was made available through WatchESPN .
Much of mandolin development revolved around the soundboard ( the top ) . Pre-mandolin instruments were quiet instruments , strung with as many as six courses of gut strings , and were plucked with the fingers or with a quill . However , modern instruments are louder—using four courses of metal strings , which exert more pressure than the gut strings . The modern soundboard is designed to withstand the pressure of metal strings that would break earlier instruments . The soundboard comes in many shapes—but generally round or teardrop-shaped , sometimes with scrolls or other projections . There is usually one or more sound holes in the soundboard , either round , oval , or shaped like a calligraphic F ( f-hole ) . A round or oval sound hole may be covered or bordered with decorative rosettes or purfling .
After each team punted , Panthers quarterback Cam Newton appeared to complete a 24-yard pass Jerricho Cotchery , but the call was ruled an incompletion and upheld after a replay challenge . CBS analyst and retired referee Mike Carey stated he disagreed with the call and felt the review clearly showed the pass was complete . A few plays later , on 3rd-and-10 from the 15-yard line , linebacker Von Miller knocked the ball out of Newton 's hands while sacking him , and Malik Jackson recovered it in the end zone for a Broncos touchdown , giving the team a 10–0 lead . This was the first fumble return touchdown in a Super Bowl since Super Bowl XXVIII at the end of the 1993 season .
The term " retro-metal " has been applied to such bands as Texas based The Sword , California 's High on Fire , Sweden 's Witchcraft and Australia 's Wolfmother . Wolfmother 's self-titled 2005 debut album combined elements of the sounds of Deep Purple and Led Zeppelin . Fellow Australians Airbourne 's début album Runnin ' Wild ( 2007 ) followed in the hard riffing tradition of AC/DC . England 's The Darkness ' Permission to Land ( 2003 ) , described as an " eerily realistic simulation of '80s metal and '70s glam " , topped the UK charts , going quintuple platinum . The follow-up , One Way Ticket to Hell ... and Back ( 2005 ) , reached number 11 , before the band broke up in 2006 . Los Angeles band Steel Panther managed to gain a following by sending up 80s glam metal . A more serious attempt to revive glam metal was made by bands of the sleaze metal movement in Sweden , including Vains of Jenna , Hardcore Superstar and Crashdïet .
In the first 200 years that black people were in the United States , they primarily identified themselves by their specific ethnic group ( closely allied to language ) and not by skin color . Individuals identified themselves , for example , as Ashanti , Igbo , Bakongo , or Wolof . However , when the first captives were brought to the Americas , they were often combined with other groups from West Africa , and individual ethnic affiliations were not generally acknowledged by English colonists . In areas of the Upper South , different ethnic groups were brought together . This is significant as the captives came from a vast geographic region : the West African coastline stretching from Senegal to Angola and in some cases from the south-east coast such as Mozambique . A new African-American identity and culture was born that incorporated elements of the various ethnic groups and of European cultural heritage , resulting in fusions such as the Black church and Black English . This new identity was based on provenance and slave status rather than membership in any one ethnic group . [ citation needed ] By contrast , slave records from Louisiana show that the French and Spanish colonists recorded more complete identities of the West Africans , including ethnicities and given tribal names .
In Bern , about 50,418 or ( 39.2 % ) of the population have completed non-mandatory upper secondary education , and 24,311 or ( 18.9 % ) have completed additional higher education ( either university or a Fachhochschule ) . Of the 24,311 who completed tertiary schooling , 51.6 % were Swiss men , 33.0 % were Swiss women , 8.9 % were non-Swiss men and 6.5 % were non-Swiss women .
In cities other than Rome , the name cardinal began to be applied to certain church men as a mark of honour . The earliest example of this occurs in a letter sent by Pope Zacharias in 747 to Pippin III ( the Short ) , ruler of the Franks , in which Zacharias applied the title to the priests of Paris to distinguish them from country clergy . This meaning of the word spread rapidly , and from the 9th century various episcopal cities had a special class among the clergy known as cardinals . The use of the title was reserved for the cardinals of Rome in 1567 by Pius V .
At the very end of the 19th century , a new style , with a carved top and back construction inspired by violin family instruments began to supplant the European-style bowl-back instruments in the United States . This new style is credited to mandolins designed and built by Orville Gibson , a Kalamazoo , Michigan luthier who founded the " Gibson Mandolin-Guitar Manufacturing Co. , Limited " in 1902 . Gibson mandolins evolved into two basic styles : the Florentine or F-style , which has a decorative scroll near the neck , two points on the lower body and usually a scroll carved into the headstock ; and the A-style , which is pear shaped , has no points and usually has a simpler headstock .
BSkyB utilises the VideoGuard pay-TV scrambling system owned by NDS , a Cisco Systems company . There are tight controls over use of VideoGuard decoders ; they are not available as stand-alone DVB CAMs ( conditional-access modules ) . BSkyB has design authority over all digital satellite receivers capable of receiving their service . The receivers , though designed and built by different manufacturers , must conform to the same user interface look-and-feel as all the others . This extends to the Personal video recorder ( PVR ) offering ( branded Sky+ ) .
